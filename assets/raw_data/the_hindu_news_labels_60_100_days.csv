‘3x3 can do what T20 did for cricket’,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/3x3-can-do-what-t20-did-for-cricket/article30957782.ece,"Former India cricket team captain Anil Kumble unveiled the logo of the FIBA 3x3 Olympic basketball qualifying tournament here on Sunday. The tournament commences at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on March 18. 
A total of 40 teams will compete and aim to clinch main draw spots at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The Indian men are placed in Group D alongside The Netherlands, Latvia, Canada and Croatia. The women’s team will battle it out with Italy, Chinese Taipei, Switzerland and Spain.
“I think 3x3 can do the same thing T20s did for cricket. It has changed everything.

"Extend qualification period, say shuttlers",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/extend-qualification-period-say-shuttlers/article30957756.ece,"Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal and P. Kashyap feel that the BWF should extend the Olympic qualification period in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak wrecking havoc on the qualifying events for the Tokyo Games.
Concerns over the rapid spread of the deadly virus had forced the postponement of the four Olympic qualifying events so far — Lingshui China Masters (February 25 to March 1), Vietnam International Challenge (March 24 to 29), German Open (March 3 to 8) and Polish Open (March 26 to 29).
 “Qualification period can be extended if the tournaments are getting cancelled cause of #coronavirus,” Saina tweeted, tagging the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
“It will be unfair for most of the players who are really close to qualifying for Olympics 2020.” 
Saina, the London Olympic bronze medallist, is currently lying at 22nd in Race to Tokyo list and needs a rapid rise in the rankings to qualify for the Games.
Her husband Kashyap and former World No. 1 Kidambi Srikanth are at 24th and 21th spots respectively in the Race to Tokyo list.
For them and several top players around the world, including China’s two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan (currently placed at 30th), the next few tournaments will be crucial as they try to squeeze into the top 16 to qualify for Tokyo.
The prestigious All England Championships (March 11 to 15), offering 12,000 ranking points for the winner, is next in line, followed by the Swiss Open, India Open (Super 500), Malaysia Open (Super 750), and Singapore Open (Super 500) before qualification period ends on April 28.

"Gold, silver lose sheen ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/gold-silver-lose-sheen/article30952976.ece,"After ruling strong for the best part of February, precious metals lost sheen towards the end of the month. Comex gold climbed to the highest level in seven years last week on growing concerns relating to the economic impact of the rapid spread of COVID-19. The weakness in global equity markets also played a part in fuelling the sentiment.
Comex gold touched a high of $1,692 an ounce on February 24 before cooling off drastically in the last few trading sessions. Comex silver recorded a high of $18.92 on Thursday and since remained subdued. 
Comex gold fell 1.34% in February to settle at $1,566.7 an ounce while silver lost 9% to settle at $16.39 an ounce. In the domestic market, the gold futures price on the MCX rose 0.9% in February to ₹41,397 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures slipped 6.5% in the month to ₹44,403 a kg.
As observed in the previous piece, Comex gold ruled firm and also moved well past the then mentioned target price of $1,625-1,630 an ounce. The short-term outlook for gold is negative and a fall to the immediate target zone of $1,510-1,520 appears likely. The negative view would be invalidated if the price moves above the resistance level at $1,625-1,630 zone.
Comex silver, too, hit the target price of $18.8-19.1 an ounce mentioned in the previous post. The short-term outlook for silver, too, is negative. A drop to the short-term support of $15.5-15.7 appears likely. 
A drop below $15.4 would impart further weakness and the price could then drop to $14.8-15. The negative outlook would be under threat if the silver price were to close above the $17.2-17.4 zone. The gold futures price at MCX ruled firm in February and hit the target price of ₹41,600-41,800 per 10 gm mentioned last month. MCX gold may remain subdued in the short-term and the price could slip to ₹39,800-40,200. A move past ₹43,100 is needed to invalidate the negative outlook. The short-term outlook for MCX silver is not too positive. The MCX silver price moved to the target zone of ₹48,800-49,000 mentioned last month and has since turned weak in the last couple of trading sessions. 
MCX silver is likely to remain subdued in the short-term and the price could slip to ₹41,500-41,750. A drop below ₹43,800 would confirm the negative outlook while a close above ₹46,500 would invalidate it.
To summarise, precious metals have achieved their short-term targets and turned weak from a short-term perspective. It is advisable to remain on the sidelines till there is evidence of te resumption of an uptrend.

Can HRA be claimed equally by self and spouse? Answers to your personal finance queries,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ask-us/article30952942.ece,"Q. I recently closed my home loan with SBI with the retirement corpus my father had accumulated. I am now paying a monthly EMI to my father with an agreed interest rate. This is a joint loan with my wife.
I have the following questions:
1) Can I claim interest benefit under section 24 for the home loan?
2) I realised that I cannot claim the principal u/s 80C as I am paying my father. Could you please confirm?
3) Should I prepare any other document to avoid I-T scrutiny? My wife and I are transferring money to my father's bank account via NEFT on the 2nd of every month.
Anil Kuppa
A. There is no specific provision under section 24 implying home loans availed from only banks and other financial institutions can be availed as deduction. Hence, interest on home loans paid to your father may be availed as deduction. However, principal repayment under section 80C can be availed only from such categories of lenders as government, LIC, National Housing Bank, other banks and financial institutions involved in financing the construction of house properties. Further, it is advisable to obtain a certificate from banks/financial institutions in support of the repayment so made. Hence, payments to your father with respect to principal cannot be availed as deduction. Documentation in the form of acknowledgement receipt from your father for the interest payments and an agreement with your father with respect to the housing loan can be entered into. It is also pertinent to note that your father should show the interest received as income in his ITR.
(The above queries were answered before the the Budget on Feb. 1 and are published now)
Q. I am a super senior citizen and a retired central government pensioner without medical insurance. I have spent about ₹10,000 towards preventive health check-ups and other medical expenses. Am I entitled to I-T exemption for the total amount, or is it limited to ₹5,000 under u/s 80D of the I-T Act?
Ram Nandula
Q. I am a super senior citizen, aged 84. This month, I incurred an expense of ₹8,400 on root canal treatment. The payment to the dentist was made by a credit card. I do not have any medical insurance. Please clarify whether this payment is eligible for deduction under Sec.80D of the I-T Act?
N.R. Krishnaswami
A. Under section 80D of the I-T Act for senior citizens, amounts paid towards medical expenditure of up to ₹50,000 can be availed as deduction in an assessment year. It is to be noted that no active medical insurance in the name of such senior citizens should be in force for such assessment year. Hence, both the claims, as above, can be made.
Q. My spouse and I work for the same organisation and live in a rented house. Both are paid House Rent Allowance (HRA). My rent paid in excess of 10% of pay works out to nil and therefore, I cannot claim any HRA exemption. As for my spouse, her HRA qualifies for exemption as the rent payment is in excess of 10% of salary. Kindly clarify if the exempted HRA could be claimed equally by self and my spouse or entire exempted HRA amount is to be claimed by my spouse only. I am in the 30% I-T slab and my wife 20% slab.
P. Venkata Rao
A. Allowable HRA is the least of the following amounts:
1) Excess of rent paid over 10% of the basic salary
2) In case you’re staying in a metro, 50% of the basic salary, and 40% if you live in a non-metro city.
3) The actual amount of HRA
HRA can be claimed as an exemption based on who is paying the rent and under whose name the current agreement is entered into. Pre-conditions under this section are that rent payment should be supported by a rental agreement and also periodic rent receipts from the landlord are to be obtained clearly displaying the names of the persons paying the rent. You may alter the rental agreement prospectively based on salaries got by both of you so that the benefits are best availed.

Film critiquing Iranian death penalty wins Berlin’s Golden Bear,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/film-critiquing-iranian-death-penalty-wins-berlins-golden-bear/article30953905.ece,"""There Is No Evil,” a study of capital punishment filmed in secret defiance of Iranian government censorship by director Mohammad Rasoulof, won the Berlin Film Festival's Golden Bear award on Saturday.
Mr. Rasoulof, whose film explores the moral dilemmas thrust on those chosen to carry out executions and the consequences of defiance for them and those around them, was unable to leave Iran to pick up the award because of propaganda charges he faces in relation to earlier films.
“This is for him,” said his daughter Baran, who stars in the film and picked up the award on his behalf. Producer Farzad Pak added thanks to the cast and crew “who put their lives in danger to be in this film.”
Jury president Jeremy Irons described the film as “four stories showing the web an authoritarian regime weaves among ordinary people, drawing them towards inhumanity,” adding that the film “asks questions about our own responsibility and choices we all make in life.”
The second-place Silver Bear went to Eliza Hittman's “Never Rarely Sometimes Always!”, the story of two teenagers from the rural U.S. defying anti-abortion activists, poverty, physical and mental harassment and expensive healthcare to obtain the pregnancy termination one of them needs.

Covering risk while earning money,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/covering-risk-while-earning-money/article30952966.ece,"There are a variety of life insurance policies.
While term policies cover only death risk and for a given period, whole life policies offer longer coverage periods with options like return of premium and other add-ons. It is the endowment policy that offers some return on the premium paid over and above just coverage. This return, or bonus, is a share of the returns that the life insurance company realises when it invests your premium and is usually more modest than even bank fixed deposit interest.
The Unit-Linked Insurance Policy (ULIP) offers life coverage and a larger component of investment. However, this investment is linked to the capital market returns on the premium funds that are invested. We can infer that the risk profile of this investment is pretty different from other life insurance policy bonuses because, in the case of the latter, the funds are invested according to prudential norms laid out in the insurance regulations designed for the safety of funds and not to maximise returns.
 In short, ULIP returns are subject to market risk while affording an opportunity for higher returns.
It is also one policy where you, as policyholder, can choose the bouquet of investments your funds should be deployed in. Funds are usually in distinct asset classes or specified combinations of asset classes. A high-risk fund would be largely in equities where the returns can also be commensurately high. A low-risk fund would have investments largely or wholly in debt securities while a medium-risk fund would have some combination of the two.
So, the policy pays out a death benefit should the policyholder die during the policy period. If he survives, he gets the maturity value of the ULIP. The death / maturity benefit is an assured sum and unaffected by the ULIP maturity value which is nothing but the value on that date of the investments in the fund of his choosing. Even if the value of the ULIP investments are less than the sum assured, the death benefit is assured.
 ULIP has some flexibilities. You can choose any option of fund to invest in and you can switch from one fund to another as well. You can top-up your ULIP policy any time and also direct future premiums to go into a specified fund. Partial withdrawals are also possible.
Staying invested also brings loyalty additions and bonuses which add value to your investment. Premium paid for a ULIP policy has tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 and maturity proceeds are tax-free under Section 10 (10) (d) subject to certain conditions.
ULIPs should be actively managed for better returns. You should study your own risk appetite, the stage of life you are in and your financial goals in order to make intelligent decisions. Some policies have systematic transfers from one asset class to another or a life-cycle-based strategy that automatically switch your funds.
Capital market investments in equities, typically, are long term in nature so you should also take a long-term view on your ULIP investment strategy given that there is a five-year lock-in period anyway.
ULIP funds of insurance companies have published track records and studying these to decide on a strategy would be a good idea.
The other important thing to track is the charges in various ULIPs. Be sure you choose one with lower charges so that more of your money is invested and earns you returns.

Financial goals can’t be influenced by Sensex,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/financial-goals-cant-be-influenced-by-sensex/article30952902.ece,"‘What do you think of the market?’ is a question I most often face from viewers, readers and members of the audience, as a practicing financial planner. The reference here is to stock market and more specifically, to the Sensex and Nifty. Honestly, no one can, with accountability, can predict the future.
Also read | Market selloff: 2,011 stocks end in red, 456 defy trend on BSE
Let us assume because of some supernatural powers an individual knows the direction of the market. Still, is that really useful? “Son, Sensex is down 10% since beginning of the year, let us postpone your marriage plan till such time the Sensex comes back to its original level.” What are the chances a father will ever say this to his son?
Requirement of funds to fulfil our financial goals cannot be dependent on the level of Sensex. Also, while we have no control over or say in the movement of the Sensex, our financial responsibility and dreams still need to be fulfilled. Beyond a point, the level of Sensex doesn’t matter.
Instead of trying to gauge the level and future of the Sensex, we must focus on ‘My Sensex.’ ‘My Sensex’ is ‘My Sensible Expense.’ We can even call it our family budget or cash-flow statement. One of my lady clients once said, “Gaurav, the word budget scares the life out of me. I prefer calling it spending list. This gives me a lot of relief.” To her, budget is restrictive but spending list sounded like freedom to spend.
There is no way I would want to preach on delayed gratification, being frugal or spending versus splurging. 
These are subjective. To a teenager or a young lady who has just started working, using the French cosmetic brand Estee Lauder is certainly splurging, but to a fashion model, it is an occupational need. My milkman, who delivers milk at 5 a.m., owning a bicycle is a necessity but what about a bicycle, for a Sunday ride with friends, costing ₹1.25 lakh for a college student?
What is of pivotal importance is being responsible for our expenses and owning up to such responsibility.
“After entering the restaurant, the family sat at a table near the window and the waiter brought in various food items. The family consumed some of the food items, wasted a lot and paid the full amount for it.” Does this make sense? Under normal circumstances, we look at the menu card, order food items of our choice and quantity of each based on our requirements. Later, we settle the bill for the items we had ordered. This way, there is either nil or little wastage. Our family budget — or spending list — is our financial menu card. 
From the list of various items on the card, we need to decide which ones and how much to spend on each.
A financial menu card can be segregated into two main categories and into further two sub-categories. Two main categories are fixed expense and variable expenses.
Fixed expense are those expenses which remain constant e.g. house rent, school fees, insurance premium and EMIs. These are fixed and mandatory. We cannot skip them. The sub-category is fixed voluntary expenses e.g. club and gymnasium membership, subscription to TV channels, magazines, etc. Here we do have an option to reduce or skip them if we wish to.
Variable mandatory expenses are grocery, transport, healthcare, clothing, utilities etc. They keep changing by a small variation month-on-month. Variable voluntary expenses are eating out, entertainment etc.
It is completely up to the individual or family to decide how much to spend on each category. What needs to be kept in mind is there is an inverse relationship between our current expenses and future wealth creation.
Saving and splurging both give rise to similar emotions — only the order in which they emerge changes. Splurging now will give us excitement now but there will be anxiety later about the amount of wealth created. On the other hand, saving now and living frugally may give frustration now but happiness will emerge later as we will have a larger corpus in our winter years. 
Avoid getting into predicting the future of Sensex or for that matter anything else. This is a futile exercise as there is nothing in our control. What is in our control is My Sensex. Spend time preparing My Sensex, my financial menu card or, as my client calls it, My Spending List.

Wrestling | Bajrang aims to peak during the Olympics ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wrestling-bajrang-aims-to-peak-during-the-olympics/article30965823.ece,"The spread of the coronavirus beyond the confines of the epicentre China has wreaked havoc with the schedules of a number of Indian Olympic hopefuls. 
In wrestling, the Olympic qualifying tournament scheduled from March 27 to 29 in Kyrgyzstan now stands cancelled. Sakshi Malik, a bronze medallist from Rio 2016, has just one more opportunity (in May in Bulgaria) to make the grade and is hoping that the outbreak doesn’t “crush her dreams”.
Even as it doesn’t affect one of India’s biggest medal prospects at Tokyo 2020, Bajrang Punia, qualify as he did quite early, the 26-year-old said it was important to be sensitive to the crisis at a humanitarian level.
“A lot of people have died and that’s horrible,” Bajrang said at an event held to announce an association between JSW Group’s Inspire Institute of Sport and Herbalife Nutrition. “It’s not only about athletes, it’s about every person. As athletes in this country we don’t have to worry about it. But you can’t just ignore it.” 
“China, Italy, Iran and many places in Europe…people can’t come from there or go there. What if there is an emergency and they can’t travel?”
Thus far the Tokyo 2020 authorities have been steadfast in their belief that the Olympics will go ahead as scheduled. 
It is with this certainty that Bajrang plans to train, though he is unsure of the events he will take part in to fine-tune his preparations.
“My target is to peak during the Olympics,” Bajrang said.
“Every wrestler, including me, comes to the Olympics with the dream of winning a medal. I should not make any mistakes. My category (65 kg) is a tough one. There are around 12-13 wrestlers who can beat anyone. ”
At the recent Asian Wrestling Championship at home, Bajrang lost to Japan’s Takuto Otoguro, an opponent who he had failed to defeat in the 2018 World Championship title clash too.

Hackers may have access to your smart device,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/slovak-firm-spots-vulnerability-in-16-devices/article30965469.ece,"If you’ve been using an iPhone, iPad, Amazon Echo or Kindle or certain handsets from Google, Samsung or Xiaomi, there is a chance that your device has been accessed or taken over by hackers, thanks to a recently discovered vulnerability in the WiFi chips used in these devices.
ESET, a Slovak cybersecurity firm, has for the last one year been working in collaboration with manufacturers of two specific WiFi chips, which were found to have been vulnerable to attack by hostile parties. The manufacturers have since released for all the vulnerable devices security patches that users can install to address the vulnerability.
According to a report released by ESET, the vulnerability named Kr00k was discovered while the firm was conducting research into KRACK, a series of attacks on WiFi devices that was detected last year. In subsequent investigations, ESET discovered that WiFI chips manufactured by Broadcom ad Cypress had the Kr00k vulnerability. Chips from both these companies have a high market share and are used in a wide range of WiFi-enabled devices.
ESET said the devices that tested positive for the vulnerability include the Amazon Echo (2nd generation), Amazon Kindle (8th generation), Apple iPad mini 2, Apple iPhone 6, 6s, 8 and XR, Apple MacBook Air Retina 13-inch 2018, Google Nexus 5, 6, and 6s, Raspberry Pi 3, Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-19505, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Xiaomi Redmi 3s, as well as some WiFi access points by Huawei and Asus.
“Simply put, any device with a WiFi chip manufactured by these two companies is vulnerable to attack, as long as the device is connected to a WiFi network and the hacker is within the range of the same network,” a cybercrime official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “Once a hacker gets access to any device for even a short period of time, they can do anything, including planting a malware or intercepting sensitive information that is being sent or received via the Internet,” the official added.

Indian cybercrime agencies are currently trying to gauge the number of devices featuring these two chips in circulation in the country to get a sense of the magnitude of the problem.
The Slovak firm states that the Kr00k vulnerability is triggered when the device in question experiences a disconnection with the network, called a “dissociation” in technical terms. The more concerning factor, according to officials, is that a dissociation can also be triggered manually.
“It is only a matter of sending a high energy pulse to the server, which can cause a temporary dissociation, while the user thinks that this happened due to a weak signal,” the official said. “A suitably designed malware can easily find its way to the user’s online storage space, like the Cloud, after which multiple possibilities, including data theft and financial crimes open up,” the officer added.",technology
Chennai has a new group of exploring cyclists ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennai-has-a-new-group-of-exploring-cyclists/article30963390.ece,"Over 100 kilometres on a cycle might seem like a lot around Chennai, especially with the summer humidity creeping in, but some views make it worth it. Just ask Naren Aakash, an enthusiast who took some of his peers cycling to Pulicat and back last week.
“I plan to do this twice a month, on alternate Saturdays,” says Naren, founder of the fledgeling cycling group Triban Roadies that is now one-ride old.. 
There are many routes to cover: the next ones I am planning will be to the Pallavaram Hills, Poondi Dam and Mahabs,” he says. There is more to look forward to than just the destinations — the Pulicat trip, for instance, afforded the cyclists scenic glimpses of early morning fishing at estuaries en route. It was a route of varied sights and terrains; the group of four kicked off from Decathlon Mogappair at 5 am, having assembled at 4.45, and first cycled along a bypass till Red Hills. 







“From Red Hills to Minjur, we took the Outer Ring Road. It has some ups and downs, but for the most part it’s a straight road without any junctions, so you can ride at your own pace and safely pick up speed if you want to,” continues Naren. Minjur onwards, the group stuck entirely to internal roads, crossing village after picturesque village on their way till Pulicat, stopping for bites, breath or just scenery as and when they felt like it.
“We also saw Pulicat beach and the light house. In fact, one of the cyclists had joined us with the sole aim of getting to the light house, “ says Naren. He goes on to explain how targets like these can act as motivators that help achieve fitness goals (or just cycling goals in general). “The man who wanted to reach the light house, for instance, was in his 50s. He had only cycled up to 50 kilometres before. We were expecting him to give in earlier, but he completed the 115 kilometre round trip with us,” he says.
Kindly noteSafety precautions the team insists on:Ride only on the left side of the roadAvoid overtakingWear bright shirts for visibility in the early morningTail lights, front lights, helmets, water and energy bars are mandatoryAverage riding speed should be around 25 kilometres per hour
Naren is not the first one to try and build a cycling community in the city. He is certainly not the first to go exploring its lesser-known natural sights either. The one thing that sets him apart, however, is his insistence that all riders use a particular model of cycles for his trips — Tribans, a series of road bikes made by Decathlon. 
“Depending on the focus of your ride, your cycle can belong to one of tree categories,” begins the cyclist who, apart from his regular corporate job, also works at Decathlon part-time. “For offroading, you go for MTBs (mountain bicycles). For short commutes, you use hybrids. And for long distances on flat roads, you use road bikes.”

Chennai’s slow dance with silent discos,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennais-slow-dance-with-silent-discos/article30963312.ece,"Revellers in Chennai are finally warming up to the sound of silence. 
In February alone, two popular events in town drew crowds with silent discos. The Big Picnic, hosted annually by Farhana Suhail and Shamshad Begum of Buva House, saw around 200 people on the dance floor the previous weekend, while Riviera 2k20 by VIT’s SPARTANs club drew nearly a thousand people.
“We had to divide them into batches of three, so everyone had space on the dance floor,” says student Shaswat Sharma of VIT. “This was the second time that we arranged for a silent disco; we also had one at our 2019 edition.”
One of the reasons silent discos seem to be picking up in the city is the mere ease of operations. Noise levels and disturbances are no longer a concern, and the biggest investment needed are headphones, which can be linked to basic sound systems or music streaming apps on smartphones. It helps that the music does not disrupt other goings-on, making it a viable option for multi-activity events. 
The other reason, of course, is the sheer fun of it. As Farhana explains, “If you don’t like the music the DJ is playing, you can just change it. The buttons are there on the headphone itself, so the tracks you dance to are up to you.” Most silent discos in Chennai have headphones that pull in three different channels of music; the ones at The Big Picnic had five, with one of them playing live mixes by a DJ. VIT had three on offer — but with three DJs, each playing live into a separate channel.

There are many ways to amp up the fun quotient here. For instance, Oscines, the city’s first silent disco establishment, has LED headphones which blink out different neon colours for different sound channels so smaller groups can zero in on the same channel and vibe on the dance floor. 
Founder Prashant Kumar, however, decided to take the neon aspect of these lights and run wild with it. “Our whole concept at Oscines is neon. We have dark lights, so if you walk in wearing white, yellow or orange, your outfit will glow. We also have neon face paint, for those who really want to get into the mood,” he says.
Having said that, Prashant’s plans for four-month-old Oscines (it opened last Navaratri, with a neon dandiya night) are still cautious, since Chennai’s response has been gradual. “Our dance floor currently has space for about 25 people at a time. We open only on Saturdays, because that is the only day we can expect a good crowd. But we are planning to try and keep it open on weekdays too, after the first week of March. Let’s see how it goes.”

Admittedly, these are slim pickings, especially considering the fact that silent discos have been drawing crowds in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata for years now. Chennai used to experience this as a once-in-a-blue-moon event, only at luxury hotels. 
However, the recent pop-up discos have made the concept much more accessible, and future ones are likely to add to the trend. 
It also helps that the headphones can be used for other activities as well. The Big Picnic, for instance, also used them for their silent theatre evenings. “People could watch movies under the stars, without being disturbed by other activities happening around them,” says Farhana. 

Having said that, the main focus of her event this past weekend was the DJ. Though the duo spent a lot of time zeroing in on the perfect set of headphones, Farhana insists that finding the right DJ was key — “We had to find someone who knows Tamil, Hindi and English music, though we realised that the first two are much more popular in Chennai.”
Oscines, on the other hand, dispenses with DJs altogether. “They are too expensive for such a small setup. We have a number of playlists and different tracks, and when the dancers have specific requests, we are more than happy to play it from their phones, YouTube, or apps like Saavn or Spotify,” says Prashant. Oscines also offers snacks and beverages, some of which are included in the ₹470 per person charge that gives you an hour and a half on the floor. “We don’t serve alcohol, though,” he says, adding curtly, “Because this is a family place. Everyone is welcome to come and have fun.”",society
Fight the bot menace,https://www.thehindu.com/society/fight-the-bot-menace/article30963221.ece,"The Hindu is a family newspaper with a strong ethical code. This is why, when they do a story on robot companions, they focus on companions for the children, rather than sex robots — a sunrise industry whose time has nearly come. 
Nevertheless, their focus is timely. Overconfidence in robotics can put our loved ones in peril. Anyone who has seen a Boston Dynamics demonstration of their latest robot will realise the risks inherent in letting them loose on youngsters and senior citizens.
Most current robots cannot bend down and turn a doorknob without falling over. These are large, metallic items with extremely limited motor skills and the IQ of a kitchen implement. Does it make sense to let one loose on granny? Within five minutes of switching it on, it would probably decapitate her and say ‘Oopsie, I did a boo boo,’ because you were too cheap to buy from a reputed company, and they sent the children’s model by mistake.
But sex robots are a far more immediate threat. By ignoring them in the name of decency, we are failing in our duty to the public. Even if you pretend you’re not planning to buy one, as soon as prices go down, it’s important to know the facts. Worldwide, the most strenuous efforts in the field of robotics are being devoted to the development of sex robots, especially in Japan.
The best-selling models are actually large plastic dolls, sometimes with a coating of silicone, but they call them robots, because no one wants to admit that they are paying 10,000 dollars for a large plastic doll, because they like the cut of her jib. They cannot move. The ones that can talk have a limited vocabulary, mostly encouraging. But they do not represent a genuine menace so far. Actual sex robots would be far more risky, with electrocution being the least of your potential hazards.
As anyone who has seen The Terminator can tell you, some day soon, the robots will rise. Your sex robot will at this point take over your phone, your laptop, your Internet and Alexa, and you will be naked and vulnerable. Your chances of escaping and joining the survivors to start a guerrilla movement will be severely compromised.
Luckily, all this is applicable only to men. All energies in the sex robot industry have been exclusively devoted to developing female sex robots, from which we can infer that women themselves prefer humans. Which means that when the robots eventually do rise, men will be immediately wiped out. Women will have more of a fighting chance, and who is to say this is a bad thing? So all the best for the future, ladies! Just remember to keep some weapons handy, and wear boots with rubber soles.

It traded with significant gains for most part of the trading session before news poured in that two fresh COVID-19 cases had been detected in India.

An online searchable database of frauds reported by banks, in the form of Central Fraud Registry, has been set up to enable timely identification, control and mitigation of fraud risk and for carrying out due diligence during the credit sanction process, the Ministry said in response to a question in the Lok Sabha.
The Fugitive Economic Offenders Act is being invoked to attach and confiscate the assets of violators and strip them of the entitlement to defend any civil claim.
The PSBs have been told to get certified copies of passports of promoters and directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing themselves of loan facilities of more than ₹50 crore. They also have been advised to decide on publishing photographs of wilful defaulters as per procedure.
The government has also asked these banks to strictly ensure rotational transfer of officials to mitigate the possibility of their involvement in any fraud. The bank heads have been empowered to issue requests for opening look-out circulars against suspects.
“For enforcement of auditing standards and ensuring the quality of audits, the government has established the National Financial Reporting Authority as an independent regulator... bank accounts of 3.38 lakh inoperative companies have been frozen,” said the government.

 She said this needs to be further backed by mapping of available health-care resources in both public and private sector, for sample testing, quarantine and treatment to prepare for likely spread.

"Jack Welch, who led GE's rapid expansion, dies at 84",https://www.thehindu.com/business/jack-welch-who-led-ges-rapid-expansion-dies-at-84/article30964917.ece,"Jack Welch, who grew General Electric Co during the 1980s and 1990s into the most valuable public company in the United States, has died at age of 84, the conglomerate said on Monday.
Welch - known as “Neutron Jack” for cutting thousands of jobs - bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting.
Under him, GE's market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion. But his push to build out the GE Capital financing business nearly proved the undoing of the entire enterprise during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, and GE now trades at a fraction of its peak value.
President Donald Trump tweeted: “There was no corporate leader like neutron Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife & family!”
In December 1980, it was announced he would succeed CEO Reginald Jones and in April 1981 he took over as the company's eighth chairman and CEO. He served in that position until he retired in September 2001, succeeded by Jeff Immelt.
GE saw great growth and expansion under Welch's leadership. Through streamlining operations, acquiring new businesses and ensuring that each business under the GE umbrella was one of the best in its field, the company was able to expand dramatically from 1981 to 2001.
“Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others,” Welch wrote in a book called Winning.
According to GE's website, Welch was born in 1935. He received his B.S. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Massachusetts in 1957 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1960.
In 1960, Welch joined GE as a chemical engineer for its plastics division in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was elected the company's youngest vice president in 1972 and became vice chairman in 1979.
In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of roughly $26.8 billion; in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion. The company was one of the most valuable and largest company in the world at the time of his retirement, up from America's tenth largest by market cap in 1981.
In 1999, Fortune named him the “Manager of the Century,” and the Financial Times named him one of the three most admired business leaders in the world.",business
Indian Medical Association flags depiction of unscientific facts in Malayalam films,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ima-requests-censor-board-to-constitute-medical-advisory-panel/article30964859.ece,"An increasing number of medical professionals have been flagging unscientific representation of facts related to medical field and treatment of diseases in Malayalam films in recent times. 
Now, the Kerala chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has intervened in the issue, requesting the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to take the opinion of a medical advisory committee before certifying films depicting medical issues. 
The IMA has, in a letter to the CBFC as well as the Culture Minister, requested to constitute such an advisory committee consisting of experts from the medical field, as a large number of people are often misled by such messages in films, which often have no scientific basis. 
The letter specifically cites two much-appreciated films from recent times, ‘Joseph’ and ‘Trance’. 
In ‘Joseph’, directed by M. Padmakumar, the narrative revolves around a retired police officer investigating the death of his former wife, and uncovering an organ harvesting racket. According to the letter, people were discouraged from signing up for organ donation. 
In the case of ‘Trance’, released two weeks ago, the IMA said that the movie had certain sequences which made misleading comments on psychiatric and psychotropic, leading to concerns among patients.
“Since cinema is a very powerful medium, what is being said through it reaches a lot of people, creating the kind of impact we cannot imagine of. For instance, in the case of ‘Joseph’, the number of organ donations came almost to a standstill in 2019, after the movie was released. This was at a time when there were more than 3,000 patients waiting for various organs. Till then, we were making immense progress in organ donation. After this dip, we had to organise a lot of awareness campaigns to dispel fears regarding organ donation, which the government is overseeing using stringent norms,” says P. Gopikumr, State Secretary of IMA. 
He says that after the release of ‘Trance’, some psychiatrists reported their patients requesting them to change their medications, as the movie had specifically named some of these medicines as causing brain damage and other serious problems. 
The movie had led to posts from several doctors and psychiatrists in social media over the past few days, countering some of the claims made in the movie. 
“What if some one with severe depression were to commit suicide because someone told him about what’s mentioned in the movie about psychiatric drugs? What if he himself watched the movie and decided to stop his medications without consulting his doctor? Being an ardent movie buff myself, it hurts me to say that malayalam cinema needs to start researching more and may even discuss with professionals and make all movies technically sound,” posted Samin Sameed, a doctor, in Facebook.
Mr. Gopikumar says that more films on scientific and medical subjects should come in Malayalam films to make people aware, but these should be factually accurate. ",movies

'Geetha Govindam' and 'HIT' cinematographer Manikandan on his work mantra,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/geetha-govindam-and-hit-cinematographer-manikandan-on-his-work-mantra/article30963300.ece,"Chennai-based DoP, Manikandan had worked in Mukunda, Srirasthu Subhamasthu, Geetha Govindam and now the just-released HIT. Is he elated at the appreciation the movie is getting? “HIT is a story that I fell for. From a cameraman’s perspective there’s a different way of approaching a thriller — a certain amount of ratio in the use of lighting and contrast. I followed the script keenly. I was with Sailesh Kolanu (director of HIT) for one month discussing our plans. Despite being a first timer, Sailesh had great clarity. He also had a clear idea of the technicians and why he wanted to designate a particular person for a department. He apparently took notes on my work after watching my films. I could understand him perfectly in his narration.”
After Geetha Govindam, he must have been flooded with offers? “I got an opportunity to be associated with web series Queen and Auto Shankar. There was so much scope for experimenting, but at the end of the day movies are more energising and give a high after release,” he says. Elaborating on the difference between the two, he says OTT is a strong and a new platform and it is growing by the day.
“There is a duration limitation in films, but in web series there is lot of input required in all spheres. Screen has a grandeur, people watch high quality television series but we need to match that and do better than that, so we need to invest more,” he says.
Dispelling the myth that when a debutant director is at the helm, producers engage strong technicians to back him up, Manikandan says, “The director gives two or three years to the script and he knows what he is doing before he embarks on the project. There is always an interaction between the director and technicians and there is scope for trying a new approach.”
Manikandan was exposed to photography in school where it was one of the vocational subjects. He learnt negative exposing and development there and found the entire process interesting. At Chennai’s MGR institute, he studied cinematography and met lot of well-known personalities in the field.
“I worked as operative camera man in many films and now that I have become a DoP, I rope in many students who graduate from that college as apprentices,” he says and adds, “After converting to digital, I worked on a Tamil film which fetched awards.”",movies
Into the wild: Rana Daggubati on 'Kaadan' and running with herds of elephants,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/into-the-wild-rana-daggubati-on-kaadan-and-running-with-herds-of-elephants/article30963293.ece,"For nearly two years, actor-producer Rana Daggubati sported long beard and a lean look, and had stated that it was his look for his new film. Now that the trilingual — Haathi Mere Saathi in Hindi, Aranya in Telugu and Kaadan in Tamil — is up for release on April 2, the actor laughs and says, “Now you know why I looked like that,” referring to his role of a ‘jungle man’.
Directed by Prabhu Solomon who earlier tapped into the wilderness for his Tamil films Mynaa and Kumki, the new film is a fiction inspired by true incidents and people, particularly environment activist Jadav Payeng. The Padma Shri winner who hails from the ‘Mising’ tribe in Assam, converted more than 1300 acres of barren land into a reserve forest.







Rana plays Bandev, the jungle man, who stands up against urbanisation encroaching into jungle corridors. 
“We have meetings in conference rooms and are unaware about the larger world out there. Every animal, plant and insect plays a role in sustaining Earth. We don’t know enough about people living in proximity with the wild — the tribes, elephant trainers... When we have a problem, there are forums to complain. Where do the animals go when their homes are invaded? Bandev is their voice,” Rana explains.
The film talks about the threat to forests, geographically appropriating the regions for Hindi, Telugu and Tamil versions. “Prabhu knows the terrain and its problems thanks to his earlier films. In areas near Coimbatore, forest land is being converted to tea estates, Kaziranga in Assam and Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh have different issues,” says Rana.
Prabhu met Rana when the actor had completed Baahubali and was looking like “an amateur bodybuilder”. Prabhu narrated the story before he went on location recce to different places, including Kaziranga National Park. “When he returned, he told me something 20 times more detailed. Everything that was there in the story was layered further, with information about true incidents and people. Prabhu first described the jungle and its issues, and then detailed the character of Bandev — where he comes from and why he cares for the environment,” recalls the actor.
Acting for Baahubali required both Rana and Prabhas to bulk up and look like warriors. Rana then sported a lean, muscular look for Ghazi and now, a nearly-malnourished and lean look for Aranya. “When I was younger, I would go about these transformations crazily. Then I learnt there’s a scientific process and work with fitness trainers and nutritionists,” says Rana. He turned vegetarian and occasionally vegan to shed the Baahubali muscles. He admits that it’s ideal to lead a healthy, balanced lifestyle for 20 to 25 years, adding, “But that’s not my job. There’s no fun if I don’t play unique characters and don’t look the part.”
Rana underwent a look test with a short beard and was almost tonsured. But Prabhu wasn’t convinced. “He said ‘ottalai’ (it doesn’t stick/gel with the character),” laughs Rana. The actor was asked to lose his heavy muscles and look lean, almost malnourished. 
As he got leaner, Rana trained for 15 days with Kumki elephant trainers, cinematographer Ashok Kumar; the costume and makeup team also stepped in. This was like an orientation period before they would shoot for more than 100 days in six jungles, including deep forests of Kerala, Satara, Mahabaleshwar and Thailand.
The three languages have different supporting cast and Rana had to shoot each shot, each scene thrice. “Forest officers, tribes and trainers in south India would look very different from those in the North. So Prabhu would look at someone and say ‘ivara paatha Maharashtrian madiri irukkare’ (he looks like a Maharashtrian) and would change him for the Telugu version,” says Rana.
The first shooting schedule was the toughest. Rana shot for 30 days in the jungles, with no mobile connectivity and no co-stars. The disconnect from the outside world helped him get into the zone this film required. The silence of the jungle as well as the sounds that arise from the conversations between animals, made the experience surreal: “It’s magical when the sun goes down and you see things glittering in the dark.” 
He listened to stories of forest rangers to understand their world and believes that cinema can be a big influence in highlighting the importance of ecological balance. “And we are doing it in a mainstream format,” Rana adds.
The team shot in the forests of Thailand with herds of elephants. Looking back, Rana says it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience: “Anything can happen when you run with a herd of 15 elephants.” The jungle was also peaceful, he remembers: “All that greenery makes you calm.”
It’s been 10 years since he debuted as an actor with Sekhar Kammula’s Leader and since then, has constantly sought the alternative space, not wanting to do the regular hero-worshipping Telugu films, “After Leader, very few people here told me the kind of stories I was looking for. So I went to Mumbai and then to Chennai since I liked the films that directors like Bala and Ameer were making. Now, I am glad we have more than a handful of Telugu filmmakers presenting different content so often.”
Summer 2020, he says, looks promising and cites Anushka Shetty’s Nishabdham and Ram’s Red, among others, for promising something new: “The millennials are doing something right,” he sums up with a laugh.",movies
Catching up with Sibiraj and Jayaprakash on the sets of ‘Kabadadaari’ ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/on-the-sets-of-kabadadaari/article30963252.ece,"“Take polaama?” asks director Pradeep Krishnamoorthy, peering into the monitor. He is happy with the way the frame is set — an angry Sibiraj pointing a gun at Jayaprakash. “Ready ah?”
Not everybody is. Cinematographer Rasamathi, perched precariously atop two stools that have been stacked on top of each other, spots someone’s shadow in the corner of his frame. It is one of the light boys who is getting things ready for the next shot. He moves away, and the shot is canned successfully.
All this action is taking place inside a dingy room at Sathyalok School for Special Children in Porur. On another day, it might have been a classroom packed with students. But today, the crew of upcoming Tamil film Kabadadaari (remake of Kannada hit Kavaludaari) have converted it into a ‘hideout’ of a disgruntled journalist, played by Jayaprakash.

“It’s again a father character, but quite different from what I’ve been playing for a very long time,” says Jayaprakash, when we catch him during a short break, “Generally, I’m called for the soft-spoken, nice man roles. But I’m happy that the makers of Kabadadaari wanted to ‘de-glamourise’ me.”
So, Pradeep and Jayaprakash sat down to design the look of an “unhealthy, unsuccessful man who is generally frustrated” for the film that is now being shot in both Tamil and Telugu. “I love this team,” says Jayaprakash, who will soon head to shoot in picturesque locations of Courtallam for Karthick Raju’s upcoming bilingual. 
 Sibiraj has just completed a close-up shot of him keeping a gun inside his pocket. He sinks into a chair and whips out his phone to check messages, and informs me that he has a handful of projects like Walter, Ranga, Ranger,Maayon and Vattam in his line-up. In Kabadadaari, he plays a traffic cop for the first time. “Just think about how they carry out their duties in the summer months,” he says, “My respect for them has increased a lot.” In the movie, Sibiraj happens to investigate a crime that happened three decades ago — something that he feels will be new to Tamil audience.

By now, the crew is moving the equipment and lights to an exterior location inside the premises of the school. Supervising them is Rasamathi, who will have to can some top-angle shots for the next sequence featuring Sibiraj and Jayaprakash. We use this break to catch up with the most busy man on set: director Pradeep, who is already discussing the next day’s schedule with producer G Dhananjayan. “When I do a remake, I keep my brains aside. The original essence should not be missed,” says Pradeep, who previously helmed Sathya, a remake of the Telugu hit Kshanam.
Pradeep is also doing a short role in the film. Mention that to him and he starts smiling, “That was a big accident.” An actor who was originally chosen for the role wasn’t very convincing and Pradeep had to step in at the last-minute.
The sun is going down fast and Pradeep and team are in a hurry — for, he has to complete a few sequences before the light fails him. Says Dhananjayan, “Shooting is like war; if we achieve something that we planned for the day, the war is won and we feel happy.” That evening at the Sathyalok School for Special Children, the team of Kabadadaari were proud winners.

‘There’s a magical power in Rahman Sir’s studio’: Singer Nakul Abhyankar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/theres-a-magical-power-in-rahman-sirs-studio-singer-nakul-abhyankar/article30962289.ece,"Nakul Abhyankar was living his childhood dream, two years ago. He was at AR Rahman’s studio, in front of the musical genius, to record ‘Neeli Kanumallo’, the Telugu version of ‘Mazhai Kuruvi’, sung in Tamil by Rahman.
The experience for Nakul was borderline-surreal despite a steady rise in his music career: reality show participant to reality show winner to graduate diploma in music at KM Music Conservatory to film singer.
“Whatever experience you have, counts for nothing when you are at his studio for the first time,” says Nakul. “It was overwhelming for me”. The realisation of a childhood dream can be for anyone. Nakul grew up listening to, and later playing on his keyboard, the tunes of Rahman. It was the latter who spurred his fascination for film music. So, to sing in front of his idol was a moment to treasure.

“On one hand, it was emotional for me. But at the same time, he is a music director and I am a singer. And, we had to work together to bring the song out.” Nakul was torn between his disbelief of working with Rahman and actually working with Rahman.
‘Neeli Kanumallo’ had several high-pitch portions. “Generally, with these portions, we tend to push a lot and we end up stressing on certain parts. But this song had to flow smoothly like butter. It was tricky.”
The song, ultimately, came out well. “Sir loved it.” After a brief pause, he adds: “There is a magical power that exists in that studio. You end up doing things you don’t expect yourself to do.”
Nakul moved from Bengaluru to Chennai in 2013, when he decided to quit his IT job and join Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory. But he didn’t realise his passion for music during his days of nine-to-five drudgery.
His isn’t that clichéd story that many upcoming writers and artists share. The IT job was just a detour. His pursuit of a career in music was organic. One of his grandfathers was a Haridasa (raconteur) and the other a Yakshagana artist. “All my cousins learnt music. My brother was greatly talented in singing. He taught me a lot. So, it wasn’t like someone had to tell me to learn music. I would just pick up the harmonium in the house and start playing the national anthem or rhymes.”
Nakul’s chartbusters‘College days’ from Rajaratha (Kannada)‘Neeli Kanumallo’ from Nawab (Telugu)‘CEO in the House’ from Sarkar (Tamil)‘Manase Manase’ from Are Marler (Tulu)‘Koode’ from Koode (Malayalam)
He was a part of the school’s music team, as a keyboard player. In 2009 and 2010, respectively, Nakul won the Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Kannada and finished in the top-nine of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Hindi. Participation in these reality shows helped him immensely. “These shows aren’t just about fame. They help you get contacts and validation. For example, the judges of the show, like Hamsalekha Sir, are big names in the industry. When they evaluate your singing, you know where you stand. So, yes, [reality shows] opened a lot of doors for me.”
Nakul got his first song, ‘Kendhaavara Hoove’ (Kirataka) after composer V Manohar liked his performances in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. “But the studio environment is completely different. It takes some time to get used to it. I had to sing my first song thrice to be approved by the composer.”
Despite getting to sing in films, he felt the need to learn more about music. Which is when he enrolled at KM Conservatory. “I already had some training in Indian classical music. And, Indian classical is melody-driven. But western classical has more to do with harmony. And, film music is a marriage of harmony and melody. At KM, I learnt a lot of western techniques, orchestration, opera singing, programming… My voice and style before and after KM are completely different.”
For someone who was always sure about a profession in music, Nakul’s still uncertain if he should specialise in one aspect of it — the education at KM broadened his scope. So, apart from singing, he also composes music -- he has so far scored for Unarvu (Tamil), College Kumara (Telugu and Tamil), Kannad Gothilla (Kannada), and Bicchugatti: Chapter 1 (Kannada), which is set to release later this year. When he has no singing or composing projects, he says, “I hang around Rahman Sir’s studio to program for him.” The studio where magic happens.",movies
"BIFFes: ‘I have watched Sholay 500 times,’ says Iranian filmmaker Shahed Ahmadlou",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/biffes-i-have-watched-sholay-500-times-says-iranian-filmmaker-shahed-ahmadlou/article30962218.ece,"The 12th edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) opened on Thursday with the Iranian dark comedy Cinema Donkey, written and directed by Shahed Ahmadlou.
It was one of the films that had a packed house on the festival’s first day. Ahmadlou says, “The movie is about friendship and peace and how important it is for the world. There is no other way to achieve success other than love and honesty.”
The message it tries to convey might sound banal. But more than the moral, it is the story that matters, especially with films. And, Cinema Donkey has an intriguing plot. According to the film’s official synopsis, it is about a filming group making a “film that has a message for humanity. They need a professional donkey for a few scenes. The budget and time limitations have made it difficult for them to find a donkey. Until the production group finds a donkey wandering in the woods.”
To film this seemingly simple, bitter-sweet tale, wasn’t easy for Ahmadlou. One of the reasons was using a real donkey in the film. “In the end, a donkey is a donkey. It tends to do what it wants to,” he says, straight-faced, “And, we are trying to make a movie about some people making a movie. Whatever problems the characters faced in the movie, we faced them too.”
Ahmadlou, 45, started his career as an actor. He then began making experimental films, some of which won awards from domestic and international festivals. He won the UNICA Gold Medal for the short film Cinema Dog.
He got into films after watching Ramesh Sippy’s Sholay. “I have watched it over 500 times. I have it on my phone. I watch it at least once a month.” Asked what he likes about the movie, he raises his brows, sighs theatrically, and says, “everything.” Satyajit Ray is another Indian director he admires.
Ahmadlou’s predecessors, like Abbas Kiarostami and Majid Majidi, have been building a rich legacy for Iranian cinema. They have also influenced filmmakers of many countries, especially through film festivals. “In Iran, you can make an independent movie with a low budget. And, you get to know from these festivals that people all over the world are liking it. It gives you the strength to keep pushing yourself. Each and every word you hear from other filmmakers from other cultures, you put it together and make a book within yourself, from which you can learn.”
As with most film industries in the world, Ahmadlou says, Iran too has separate spaces for mainstream and art-house cinema. “The movies that balance art and entertainment end up being successful and also stand the test of time,” he adds.",movies
Tiger Shroff feels that ‘SOTY2’ failed because fans couldn’t accept him getting beaten up on-screen,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tiger-shroff-feels-that-soty2-failed-because-fans-couldnt-accept-him-getting-beaten-up-on-screen/article30962202.ece,"Actor Tiger Shroff says his action star image made it difficult for his fans to accept him in the character of a student who gets bullied and beaten up in Student of the Year 2. The Karan Johar-backed sequel also featured Ananya Panday and Tara Sutariya and was set in a fictional college campus but did not do well at the box office.
 Tiger said he understood why the audience couldn’t connect with the film.
“I got a lot of feedback from my fans as well, saying, ‘We used to see you as this one-man army take down machines single-handedly and here you’re getting beaten up in college, we couldn’t digest that.’ I guess it’s my fault and my failure to not do it convincingly,” Tiger said in a group interview.
 The actor, known for his action films, is back to the genre with Baaghi 3. 
Tiger said a good action film needs an emotional story, without which all the stunts in a film would appear as a showpiece: “If there’s no emotion or reason in an action movie, then that action just becomes a show-reel and feels like a decoration. Once the action has a reason, then that action multiplies and the audiences also feel connected and more engaged.” 
The action has been scaled up for the third movie in the franchise, which will be directed by Ahmed Khan.
“It’s man vs man, man vs machines and man vs nature, quite literally. I’m fighting helicopters and tanks. All the action that is seen in the trailer is all live. Very little VFX has been used in this film. I give all the credit to Ahmed sir and Sajid (Nadiadwala) sir,” he added.
For the longest, the actor has been attached to star in the Hindi remake of Rambo, which reunites him with his War director Sidharth Anand. 
 There has been no movement on the project so far but Tiger said the film has not been shelved. 
“It is still happening. It is pushed right now. It doesn’t make sense doing two back-to-back more or less Rambo-like films.” 
Baaghi 3 is set to release on March 6. ",movies

OMCs cut petrol and diesel prices,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/omcs-cut-petrol-and-diesel-prices/article30964658.ece,"State owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on March 2, 2020 have reduced the price of petrol by 22-23 paise a litre and diesel price by 20-21 paise a litre respectively, making it the fifth consecutive price reduction for diesel since February 26, 2020 and third consecutive price cut for petrol since February 28, 2020.
Interesting read: Petrol, diesel prices see steepest hike since July 5
Petrol now costs ₹71.49 per litre in Delhi, ₹77.18 per litre in Mumbai, ₹74.16 a litre in Kolkata and ₹74.28 per litre in Chennai after the price cut.
Similarly, diesel costs ₹64.10 a litre in Delhi, ₹67.13 a litre in Mumbai, ₹66.43 a litre in Kolkata and ₹67.65 per litre in Chennai, according to data by Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL).
This cut comes after the price of petrol was reduced by 17 paise a litre and that of diesel by 21 paise a litre on Sunday.
The prices were reduced after the international crude oil prices witnessed a downward trend due to slump in demand. The crude oil price was hovering a little above $50 per barrel on Sunday after COVID-19 deaths and cases increased all over the world.

India’s manufacturing PMI goes down in Feb as coronavirus outbreak hits business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-manufacturing-pmi-goes-down-in-feb-as-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-business/article30961632.ece," The country’s manufacturing sector activity eased in February from a near eight-year high in the previous month and business sentiment took a hit amid impact of coronavirus outbreak on exports and supply chains, a monthly survey said on March 2.
At 54.5 in February, the headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) held close to January’s near eight-year high of 55.3, signalling improvement in operating conditions across the sector.
 This is the 31st consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.
“Factories in India continued to benefit from strong order flows in February, from both the domestic and international markets. The pick-up in demand meant that companies were able to further lift production and input buying at historically-elevated rates,” said Pollyanna de Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.
 The strong manufacturing sector expansion seen in India at the start of the year was maintained in February, with rates of growth for factory orders, exports and output holding close to January’s recent highs. While firms were willing to step up input buying, hiring activity increased only fractionally.
“However, alarm bells are ringing for Indian goods producers as the COVID-19 outbreak poses threats to exports and supply chains. Businesses became less confident about the year-ahead outlook for output, in turn restricting hiring activity,” Ms. Lima added.
 The coronavirus outbreak has brought a large part of the world’s second-largest economy China to a standstill and its impact has been felt across industries.
 On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global health emergency. The number of deaths globally in the new coronavirus outbreak passed 3,000 on Monday, as China reported 42 more deaths.
 On the price front, there was only a moderate increase in input costs, the survey said. “...Price data continued to highlight a lack of inflationary pressure in the sector. Only modest increases in input costs and output charges were recorded in February, a trend that has been a key theme of the manufacturing PMI survey for over a year,” Mr. Lima said.
 Meanwhile, India’s economic growth slowed to a near seven-year low of 4.7% in October-December 2019.
 Despite being one of the strongest periods due to festival season and higher rural spending driven by kharif harvest, October-December was the third straight quarter of growth decline and the lowest rate in 27 quarters.",economy
Monthly GST lottery offer for B2C invoices to start from April 1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/monthly-gst-lottery-offer-for-b2c-invoices-to-start-from-april-1/article30959147.ece,"The government is planning to launch monthly lottery offer under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from April 1 by conducting lucky draws for invoices of all business to customer (B2C) transactions. The offers would range between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore, said an official.
The lottery scheme is being envisaged by the revenue department to encourage customers to take bills for every purchase, which will in turn help the government in curbing GST evasion.
 Under the scheme, the revenue department will conduct monthly lucky draws which will have one bumper prize, while there would be second and third prizes state wise, an official said.
“The lottery scheme is planned to be launched on April 1,” the official added.
 A member in the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had last month said that the lottery offers would range between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore.
 The official said consumers will have to scan and upload any B2C invoice using a mobile app, which is being developed by GST Network (GSTN), which handles the technology backbone of GST.
 The mobile app would be made available for both Android and iOS users by end of this month.
 There would not be any threshold on the invoice value to be eligible for lucky draw, the official added.
 GST, which became effective from July 1, 2017, has subsumed over a dozen indirect taxes, like excise and service tax. However, revenue under the new indirect tax regime has not picked up as per expectations, mainly on account of evasion.
 Officials expect the lottery scheme to incentivise customers to ask for bill or invoice while making purchases.
 The GST Council is likely to vet the lottery scheme in its next meeting on March 14.
As per the plan, the money for the lottery scheme would come from the consumer welfare fund, where the proceeds of anti-profiteering cases are transferred. ",economy

Olympics could be postponed to end of year: Japan minister,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympics-could-be-postponed-to-end-of-year-japan-minister/article30974512.ece,"Japan’s Olympic minister on Tuesday said that the Tokyo 2020 Games could be moved from the summer until later in the year due to fears over coronavirus outbreak.
In response to a question in Japan’s parliament, Seiko Hashimoto said Tokyo’s contract with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) “calls for the Games to be held within 2020”, as quoted by BBC Sport.
She added that “could be interpreted as allowing a postponement”.
The Olympics are slated to start from July 24 and is set to continue till August 9.
“We are doing all we can to ensure that the Games go ahead as planned,” Hashimoto added.
Japan's government, Tokyo organisers and the IOC have all pledged to hold the Games on schedule from July 24, but the fast-spreading virus continues to raise concerns.
“Looking at the contract once again, it says in Article 66 that the IOC holds the right to cancel the Games by deactivating the contract if... the Games are not held in 2020,” Hashimoto said.
“At this moment, the Tokyo 2020 committee, the IOC and Tokyo (city government) are doing their best to make sure the Games will be held from July 24,” she added.
“The government will fully support that.”

With love to Bangalore,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/bangalore-blues-radha-thomas-aman-mahajan/article30972740.ece,"Bangalore Blues is the latest album by Jazz vocalist and author Radha Thomas who is all set for the release. It all started in 2011 as a Google search for Radha who was looking for a piano player and found Aman Mahajan just two streets away in Cox Town. “A match made in musical heaven” she says as they have since been working together, composing and playing much music across India and Europe. While their music is rooted firmly in jazz, there are definite strains of India in the songs. But Radha, who grew up mostly in a boarding school in Panchgani, joined a rock and roll band and later lived in New York.
Radha Thomas spoke more with Metroplus about the making of her album.
Is your album Bangalore Blues a melancholic tribute to the city?
The album didn't happen overnight. Aman (Mahajan) and me, have been writing and trying to perfect the music for almost ten years. It's only now that we felt ready to make an album. It's called ‘Bangalore Blues’ because that's the title track. This is a song I wrote a while ago, when I wasn't in this city, and missing it a lot. I was feeling all nostalgic about Bangalore. The song got completed after I met Aman and he added his magic to it. 
The album is not so much an ode to Bangalore as it is a just a statement of fact. I think that missing Bangalore and writing a sad song about that is very different to living in the city and facing day-to-day issues. 
We have another song called ‘Load Shedding,’ which is all about the power cuts in town. So it's not all rosy. Sometimes it's black and candle lit. We have a video for this song, actually shot entirely in candlelight by this gifted film maker, Sharath Holla. https://youtu.be/PMo6jDg5TEQ
Could you talk about the process of creating the album? 
I wrote all the lyrics to all the songs. Two of the melodies were composed by Aman, ‘Leifmotif’ and ‘Load Shedding.’ All the others were mine, but with huge inputs from Aman in terms of chords and arrangements and so on. It's a very collaborative effort. Aman and I tend to get the same ideas almost simultaneously. 
Could you describe the songs?
‘The Morning After’ with Indian melodic influences and a jazz treatment, describes the after effects of a night with super-sized gin and tonics with a girlfriend in lower Manhattan. ‘Jailer’ is a waltzy song that talks about a terrible experience that I had years ago. Rather than tackling the abuser, it was happier writing songs about it. ‘Would I Lie for you’ is a funky tune used with a typical Mridangam korvai to suit lyrics. The Indian influence is evident, but the treatment is neo jazz. 
‘Leifmotif’ a delicate composition by Aman is in seven beats for the most part. The origins of this song are in raag Yaman but with many jazz substitutions. ‘Only Illusion’ has syncopating rhythms and changing time-feel...a meditative song of love and longing. The piano work is almost classical in nature. ‘Bangalore Blues’ talks of a snowy winter’s day in New York, when I longed for jacaranda trees and greenness of home. 
What made you bring in artist Paul Fernandes to do the artwork for your album and video?
Paul Fernandes is a chronicler of Bangalore an he has a quaint, ironic and witty way of capturing this city in his art. He is really quite astonishing. I asked him if he would let me use his art for my album and to my utter joy he said yes. Not only that, we decided to use many of his artworks for a video for the title track. 
After training in Hindustani how did you find the shift to Jazz cope with your timbre? 
I studied Hindustani music a long time ago. And even then, I was already in a rock and roll band. I took lessons to help me sing better and also to be able to incorporate the improv techniques with my own singing. 
Your huge break in the 70s is after you joined the rock ‘n’ roll band, Human Bondage?
I was auditioned by a very serious organisation called Jazz India when I was about 18 and singing at Chin Lung Restaurant in Bangalore. They said if they liked my singing, they would help my career - if they didn't like me, I was out of luck. I guess I was good enough, because they paved the way for me to New York to meet some amazing musicians and perform and get myself a little experience.
The musical duo 
Aman Mahajan says Radha and he have worked together for almost a decade now, playing all kinds of music together with many different groups, focussing mostly on jazz standards and original music. What sets Bangalore Blues apart he says is “a collaboration in the truest and most basic sense – a completely stripped-down piano-voice duo version of songs by the two of us.”",entertainment

Cement industry capacity utilisation to moderate,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cement-industry-capacity-utilisation-to-moderate/article30975515.ece,"The domestic cement industry’s capacity utilisation is likely to moderate in FY20 to sub-70% levels, says ICRA Ratings.
The demand revival trend witnessed in recent months is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of FY20. However, sustainability of the same is critical to support the increase in prices, it added.
According to the rating agency, the cement demand growth is expected to remain flat in FY20 against the decade high growth of 13% witnessed in the previous year.
This growth along with expected higher capacity additions at 20-22 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in FY20/FY21 (17 MTPA in FY19) is likely to result in moderation of industry’s capacity utilisation in the current fiscal.
“The incremental/new supplies are not fully integrated and most of it is backed by old limestone mining leases. Also, given that the grinding capacity addition is higher in relation to the clinker capacities for these new units, the actual production from new capacities could be lower,” said Anupama Reddy, assistant vice-president, ICRA Ratings.
“The eastern region is expected to lead the expansion and is likely to add around 15-19 MTPA during FY20-FY21. Increase in capacities with no commensurate increase in demand would result in a decline in utilisation rate to 68% in FY20 from 71% in the previous fiscal,” she added.
In the nine months of current fiscal, the production, at 247.4 million tonnes, was marginally higher by 0.7% compared with the corresponding year-ago period. The production has been increasing on an month-on-month basis from September 2019. A double-digit growth in cement demand of 11.8% was witnessed in December 2019, ICRA said.
At the pan-India level, the prices in most markets were higher in ten months of FY20 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. In the Mumbai and Hyderabad markets, the prices were higher by 7-8% and in Delhi, around 20-25% was witnessed in December 2019. The prices witnessed some increase in the range of ₹5-20/bag across regions in January-February 2020. 
“There has been some demand revival in November – December 2019 and as per our channel checks, the trend is likely to continue in Q4 FY20. The sustainability of this is critical to support the recent increase in the cement prices,” she said.",business

The rupee dropped below the 73-a-dollar level even as the equity markets bounced back, snapping a seven-day losing streak.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepped in to issue a statement saying the central bank was closely monitoring the situation and stood ready to take appropriate action.
The central bank acknowledged that the spillover of the global financial market turmoil in India had been largely contained as there were hopes of coordinated policy action.
 “Globally, financial markets have been experiencing considerable volatility, with the spread of the coronavirus triggering risk-off sentiments and flights to safe haven. Spillovers to financial markets in India have largely been contained. Growing hopes of coordinated policy action to mitigate a broader fallout to economic activity have boosted market sentiment today,” the RBI said.
“The Reserve Bank of India is monitoring global and domestic developments closely and continuously and stands ready to take appropriate actions to ensure orderly functioning of financial markets, maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability,” it added. 
The rupee opened stronger at 72.45 a dollar compared to its previous close of 72.76, but weakened after reports of the COVID-19 spreading in India. 
A school in Noida was reportedly shut down after a student’s parent tested positive for COVID-19. The Indian currency ended the day at 73.23, down 0.65% from its previous close — a 16-month low.
The spread of the virus, the impact of which is expected to be higher than that of the SARS outbreak in 2003, is likely to affect global trade. The IMF has lowered global GDP growth projections by 10 basis points to 3.2% in 2020. 
 Since India and China are major trading partners, a sharp hit to their exports and imports is likely. 
“Slowdown in economic activity in China is likely to weigh on exports from India. China’s economic growth is likely to moderate to below 6% in 2020,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.

Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal's Rakshan: ‘Sivakarthikeyan’s success makes directors look at people like me’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sivakarthikeyans-success-makes-directors-to-look-at-people-like-me-rakshan/article30972542.ece,"Rakshan has been at the receiving and giving end of con jobs in his life.
As the victim, it was quite hard to take lying down. Being duped off huge sums of money seldom elicits a pleasant feeling about the self, especially when said money was raised after pawning your mother’s jewels.
“I was trying so hard to break into films then,” says Rakshan, of a time in the late Noughties and early 2010s.
“People whom I approached [for opportunities] asked me money. They told me to get ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore. I collected some ₹15 lakh and gave it to a ‘director’ who promised to make me a hero. It was money that my mother helped gather by pawning things including her nose ring. One day after I gave them the money, the entire team working on that film vanished,” he adds.
The Star Vijay anchor, who made a star turn in Desingh Periyasamy’s recently-released Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal as a con artist alongside Dulquer Salmaan, is a real live wire. When quizzed of the con job he pulled off, he says, “It is actually like a scene straight out of a movie.”

Out of cash and out of luck, Rakshan, whose real name is Ram Kumar, gave up on his screen dreams, albeit temporarily, and came to terms with the fact that he had to enter the salaried workforce to keep his family afloat.
There was just one problem. A school dropout is not likely to be highly thought of by potential employers.
“I had problems studying. I dropped out after Class X. I found it difficult to follow what was being taught. My friends tell me I’m dyslexic. I don’t know. What I know is that I couldn’t copy what my teachers were writing on the board. I couldn’t even copy from my friends during exam!”
And so, when he had to take up a job, his friends prepared a fake resume. “It was a job opportunity at a BPO centre. They (his friends) put all kinds of things on it like I was Quality Analyst and such. I had no idea what it was,” he says.

On the day of the interview, as he was pacing about the office floor not knowing what to do, Rakshan stopped to ask for a glass of water. He was shown the way to a water dispenser, which was placed on the floor where the company’s many call centre employees were handling one phone call after another.
“I listened into a conversation. One guy was being yelled at by a customer. He escalated the issue to his superior, who asked him a few questions like: ‘Is it an inbound or outbound call?’ The guy said outbound. The supervisor then asked him if he had done a ‘sales pitch’ and the guy said ‘yes’. I stood there observing their exchange silently. When I went into the interview room, the recruiters looked at my profile and asked me if I had worked in inbound or outbound calls. I said ‘outbound’ and then they asked me if it was tech support or sales pitch. I said, ‘sales pitch’, and then managed to make up an imaginary example based on what I had just witnessed outside. That was it. I got the job,” he chuckles.
It is not an isolated incident in the life of Rakshan. His street smartness took him through several jobs and businesses; he has done it all — from being a pharmacy help to selling clothes, restoring totalled cars and getting into the middleman business helping pet owners sell puppies to others for a commission.
But it is his uncanny ability to memorise events and scripts, however many pages it may be, that brought him to the doorstep of success and eventual fame with Star Vijay.

“It is what I used to do as a host of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru. It is something that (actors) Sivakarthikeyan anna and Simbu (STR) anna appreciated me for; though if you ask my teachers, they would not have anything nice to say about me.”
Once bitten twice shy goes the saying. So when his TV fame brought along offers, Rakshan was happy to pass them over as he thought they would never materialise.
“When I learnt that I was playing a full fledged role alongside Dulquer, I was sold. I remember thinking... ‘Aha, inime Kerala la puttu and kadala curry namakku free’. But I don’t know how to thank Dulquer for giving me that space. Knowing him, he would only ask why should I need to thank him,” Rakshan remarks.
Kannum Kannum... received a positive response at the box office, and Rakshan is hopeful that the film’s success will lead to better offers. But he is not about to turn his back on television.
“I will only try cinema as a parallel to my television commitment. People smile at me when I’m in a restaurant, asking me how I am doing because of my television presence. The audience connect is better there,” he says, adding in conclusion: “It is Sivakarthikeyan anna’s success in cinema that has made it possible for producers to sit up and take notice of people like me, you know... anchors.

 Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group, will bring out the memoir on April 7, the company said in a statement to Variety.
“The book is a comprehensive account of his life, both personal and professional, and describes his work in films, theatre, television, nightclubs, and print,” the publishing house said.
 The book, in which Allen has also written about his relationships with family, friends, and “the loves of his life”, will also release in Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Spain, besides the US.
It was reported last year that Allen was pitching his memoir to several publishers, but was rebuffed in the wake of the #MeToo movement. 
The multi-hyphenate director has become a subject of discussion over the resurfacing of the sexual assault allegations levelled against him by his step-daughter Dylan Farrow which caught steam in the wake of the #MeToo uprising. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.
 Incidentally, Hachette’s division Little, Brown and Company published Catch and Kill, by Allen’s estranged son Ronan Farrow in 2019. In the book, Farrow wrote about his reporting during the #MeToo movement that led to the downfall of many powerful Hollywood executives.
 Dylan took to Twitter to slam the company for betraying her brother with their decision to publish Allen’s memoir.
“Hachette’s publishing of Woody Allen’s memoir is deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men. For the record, I was never contacted by any fact checkers to verify the information in this ‘memoir’, demonstrating an egregious abdication of Hachette’s most basic responsibility,” she said in a statement posted on the micro-blogging site.

Boney Kapoor’s special pooja in remembrance of Sridevi,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/boney-kapoors-special-pooja-in-remembrance-of-sridevi/article30972177.ece,"It has been two years since Sridevi passed on.

"Parthiban on 'Iravin Nizhal', his next attempt which will be a single-shot feature",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-parthiban-on-iravin-nizhal-his-upcoming-film/article30972075.ece,"“I wake up every day dreaming about Iravin Nizhal, my upcoming film,” says actor-director Radhakrishnan Parthiban. Iravin Nizhal is another first-of-its-kind; it will be a single-shot feature. “The idea has been in my head for five years and it is finally taking shape,” he says. 
Parthiban is well known for his unique attempts — as an actor and director. His last film was a thriller, Oththa Seruppu Size 7, a solo act with only one character played by him. Considered a rare attempt in Indian cinema, Parthiban thought that it would be nominated for the Academy Awards 2019. “I spent several lakhs on screenings to jury members to take my film directly to the Oscar list,” he says. That, however, did not happen. But the actor is undeterred. “I have been trying to make Oththa Seruppu Size 7 for 15 years. The audience has welcomed it and the response was uplifting. My audiences are my friends, and I keep my fans close to me.”
 Parthiban says he tries pushing himself with every project. “One of my earlier films Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam came with a tagline ‘A film without a story’ and it clicked with the audience. I was amazed by their comments on social media.It’s not about celebrating me, but my ideas. I still get claps (ISI marked claps!) from my audience because I reinvent myself.” Remembering the legends of Tamil Cinema, Parthiban says, “Kalaignar [Karunanidhi], Kavignar Vaali and K Balachander are always amidst us. The spontaneity and wit of Kalaignar is something I cherish every single day. My satire is nothing in front of his dialogues in Parasakthi. Also, K Balachander... there have been many days when I have stayed back in theatres to watch back-to-back shows of his films. They still live on through their work.”
What’s coming up?Parthiban will be acting with Vijay Sethupathy in Tughlaq Darbar, and feels that this pairing will be something to look out for. “Our pairing will be something to look out for,” promises Parthiban. He is also acting in a web series called Suzhal directed by Pushkar and Gayatri, the husband and wife filmmaker duo who made films like Oram Po, Va-Quarter Cutting and Vikram Vedha. 
He describes the women in his family as his ‘strength’. “Be it my amma or my daughters Keerthana and Abhi, they are my pillars (when I ask my daughters if I should buy an apartment or make another Oththa...they pick the film). Even in my first film, it is the husband who falls at his wife’s feet. In Kathai, Thiraikathai... it’s the husband who gives his wife a foot massage. You don’t have to necessarily always hold a woman’s hand to say that you are there for her... you can also touch her feet,” he says. 
When he started out as an assistant director with actor-director K Bhagyaraj, he says he was amazed by the talent he saw around him. “I didn’t have a choice but to sharpen my skills to survive. I grew up watching classics that consumed me and sucked me into a different world. When I started looking for work in cinema, there have been times when I went hungry for several days. I owe everything to cinema. I want to keep dreaming big and stay new. I want to hold on to the warmth of my dreams.”
Parthiban was at Odyssey book store in Brookefields Mall, Coimbatore, to launch the reprint editions of his books Kirukkalgal and Kathai, Thiraikathai, Vasanam, Iyakkam and for a meet-and-greet session with readers.",movies
BiFFes: ‘You can see different architectural styles in Bengaluru’s theatres’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/you-can-see-different-architectural-styles-in-bengalurus-theatres/article30971775.ece,"“The most important thing is to create awareness about the past,” said historian Suresh Moona at a talk on Bengaluru’s cinema theatre landscape: then and now, organised as part of BiFFes on February 29 at Orion Mall.
Stating that it was important for everyone living in Bengaluru to have a basic idea of the city’s history, Suresh told the audience that his focus would be on the architectural features of the theatres. “Bangalore has been known for different types of architectural sights. We had Tudor, Hoysala, later colonial architecture, Indo-Saracenic… If you observe the (old) theatres, you will see these architectural styles in their construction.”







However, he also made it clear to the audience that he had less time than originally planned and would have to speed through the presentation. Beginning by displaying an artist’s impression of Kempegowda’s Bangalore on the screen, he said, “There are many similarities between Kempegowda’s Bangalore and Londonium. Londonium was 1,500 years old when Kempegowda conceived building a new city. January 14, 1537 is considered to be the date of the founding of Bangalore. Imagine his thinking to go beyond the seas, think globally and bring those concepts locally. All these things paved the way for Bangalore in the future to become a city with multicultural aspects, and a city with film culture.” 
Suresh then talked about the history of the rulers of Bengaluru, starting from the Kempegowda family and ending at the present administration by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. The theatre (plays) movement emerged, which was a “springboard” for film development to take place, he said. Film activities in Bengaluru started with the distribution of Hindi films at Gandhinagar, he said and added that the spot needed to be commemorated. 







“Kempegowda Road was the hub of the film theatres while the Cantonment area catered to the British. According to one estimate, in the 1970s, there were 148 theatres in the city.”
Suresh then said many theatres were built with the purpose of being choultries, adding Paramount Theatre, Doddanna Hall, was one such. Talking about the structure, he said that it was built in the Tudor style.
Showing photos, he also spoke a little on theatres including Select Picture Palace, Theatre Majestic, Opera, Elgin, BRV Talkies, Rex, Shivaji, Galaxy, Plaza, Everest, Sharda, Kapali, Navrang and Vijayalakshmi.
He concluded by talking about film societies, film historians, and the advent of multiplexes. Suresh suggested that in order to preserve our heritage and make future generations aware of it, it was important to put up information boards, print postcards of old theatres and display photographs of the theatres in public spaces.",movies
"Ashley Zukerman to essay role of Robert Langdon in NBC drama , based on Dan Brown’s book",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ashley-zukerman-to-essay-role-of-robert-langdon-in-nbc-drama-based-on-dan-browns-bestseller/article30970861.ece,"Actor Ashley Zukerman is set to play the title role in NBC’s drama pilot Langdon, based on the character in Dan Brown’s bestseller The Lost Symbol.

Oscar-winning actor Timothy Hutton accused of raping 14-year-old girl in 1983,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oscar-winning-actor-timothy-hutton-accused-of-raping-14-year-old-girl-in-1983/article30970751.ece,"Oscar winner Timothy Hutton has been accused of rape by a Canadian former model who claims the actor sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when she was 14. The actor, who was most recently in Netflix series Haunting of the Hill House and biographical drama Beautiful Boy, said he “completely and unequivocally denies” the claims and called it an attempt to extort money.
 In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Sera Johnston has alleged that the veteran actor raped her in 1983 when she was a junior high school student in a Vancouver hotel room while another man looked on and participated.
 Hutton was shooting the 1984 film Iceman and he and two friends began a conversation with her and two of her classmates. He then invited them back to his hotel to hang out, according to the new report. 
When the girls returned to the actor’s room, they were served drinks and Johnston said Hutton got close to her, brought her to his bedroom and raped her while a friend watched.
 Johnston said she doesn’t remember how she was led to the actor’s bedroom, but said he asked whether she had ever had sex. 
She said she initially told the men she was 17, then later admitted she was 14 years old. The age of consent in Canada is 16 years old now, but was 14 years old in 1983. There is no statute of limitations for sexual assault, misconduct or battery claims in Canada.
“I don’t think this is a good idea. I don’t think my mother would be too happy about this,” the ex-model, who was also a working actor at the time, recalled saying to Hutton. 
She said she wanted to leave. “To everything I would say, it was, ‘It’ll be OK, it’ll be OK. It won’t last long, and you’ll be fine’,” Johnston said.
 Johnston said she begged the men.
“Please, don’t do this. I can’t do it. I can’t,” she said, adding Hutton told her she would like it and that his friend was going to watch.
 Johnston filed a criminal complaint with the Vancouver police late last year about the alleged incident.
 Lawyers for Hutton said Johnston’s story is “fabricated” and contains “patently false, scurrilous, and defamatory statements“.
In a statement, his lawyer said the actor, whose Fox series Almost Family concluded its first season in February, has never met Johnston at all.
“(He) will not spend one more minute dignifying these allegations as they are patently false and designed only to extort money from him. (Johnston) has provided salacious, heinous, and graphic details of this made-up sexual encounter that supposedly occurred 36 years ago. Although these were disgusting details any smut fiction writer could conjure up. There is no evidence to support them,” Hutton said.
 Johnston countered she was advised by one attorney to reach a settlement considering that she was within the legal age of consent at the time of the alleged incident. 
She added Hutton agreed to an initial settlement of USD 135,000 (less than the USD 1.5 million her lawyer had suggested), but she later scrapped the deal.
 The veteran actor has enlisted two law firms and three spokespeople to counter Johnston’s claims. 
Hutton won the best supporting actor Academy Award in 1981 for his role in Ordinary People. ",movies
Cut in Budgetary allocation will jeopardise tourism: House panel,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cut-in-budgetary-allocation-will-jeopardise-tourism-house-panel/article30975507.ece,"The Finance Ministry’s move to cut down the budgetary allocation for the Tourism Ministry in the upcoming financial year will ‘seriously jeopardise’ the targeted tourism outcomes during 2020-21, a Parliamentary panel has said in its report.
In the Union Budget 2020-21, the Tourism Ministry has witnessed a reduction in allocation of funds due to “broad budgetary cuts imposed by the Ministry of Finance”, and has been allocated ₹2,499.83 crore as against its projected demand of ₹2,647.25 crore, leading to a shortfall of ₹147.42 crore.
Noting that less allocation as compared to the projected demand was not unique to FY2020-21, the panel pointed out that against the projected demands of ₹4,320.42 crore and ₹4,612.18 crore for FY2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively, the Ministry of Finance provided ₹2,150.00 crore and ₹2,189.22 crore in budget estimates (BE) 2018-19 and BE 2019-20, which was further reduced to ₹2,113.48 crore and ₹1,416.00 crore as revised estimates (RE) 2018-19 and RE 2019-20 stages, respectively.
“The committee notes with dismay the huge mismatch between the projected demand for funds and actual allocations made for the Ministry of Tourism for the years 2018-19 and 2019-20 as well,” the report said.
The Parliamentary Panel also hit out at the ministry, stating that the pattern of shortfall in allocation of funds indicated that budgetary requirements were being projected by the ministry more on the basis of theoretical anticipation rather than on actual trend of requirement.
In its analyses of the Budget, the panel added that since development of tourism infrastructure was capital intensive, the budgetary allocation of ₹2,499.83 crore for the upcoming fiscal “was low” and it would be difficult for the Ministry to take up significant activities related to on-going infrastructure development with this budget.
The Ministry in its submission to the Committee has pointed out that the difference in the projection made by it and the allocation given is not high, and if additional funds are required, it would move the Ministry of Finance for additional allocation at the RE 2020-21 stage.
Stating that availability of adequate resources to the tourism sector is sine qua non for achieving the tourism growth as well as inclusive growth, the committee asked the Ministry of Tourism to bring the above recommendation to the notice of Ministry of Finance and also intimate the committee its response.",economy
"Rural ATMs under recalibration for ₹200, ₹500 notes ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rural-atms-under-recalibration-for-200-500-notes/article30975131.ece,"Automated teller machines (ATMs), mostly in rural areas, are being recalibrated to replace the cassettes for ₹2,000 bank notes with either those for ₹500 or ₹200.
This is because in such areas the demand for ₹2,000 bank note is not high while lower denomination notes are more sought after.
“It is more in the rural areas. There, people do not want ₹2,000 notes. Because it becomes difficult to change those notes. They generally prefer ₹100 and ₹200,” said Navroze Dastur, MD, NCR Corporation. NCR manages close to 1.1 lakh ATMs in the country.
There are a total 2.1 lakh bank-deployed ATMs in the country apart from about 30,000 white label ATMs.







 
“Not all the ATMs are replacing the ₹2,000-note cassette. It is being done strategically, depending on the requirement and the need of the location,” he said.
The average ticket size of ATM withdrawals is ₹4,000 to ₹4,500, slightly up from the ₹3,500 earlier.
According to Mr. Dastur, in the urban and metro locations, ATMs typically carry ₹2,000 notes. Bank branches in the urban areas also prefer putting ₹2,000 notes in their ATMs.
Mr. Dastur emphasised that it was a business decision that responded to the demand.
“In some urban areas also, if you do not see offtake of ₹2,000 notes as a business decision, you will replace the ₹2,000 with ₹500 or ₹200,” he added.
The ₹2,000 notes came into calculation after the demonetisation exercise of 2016 when ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes were withdrawn from the system.
According to RBI data, 3,291 million pieces of ₹2,000 notes were in circulation as at March 2019, which was roughly the same figure for the previous two years.
A recent report by RBI has showed that the country continues to have a strong bias for cash payments.
Cash withdrawals from ATMs have increased over the past five years and India is next only to China in terms of cash withdrawals from ATMs. However, the percentage of cash withdrawals to GDP has been constant in India at about 17%.",economy

In a unanimous decision, the Fed’s policy-setting committee cut its key interest rate by a half point to a range of 1.0-1.25.
The large, highly unusual cut, taken just 15 days before the next scheduled policy meeting, reflected growing concerns that the spreading virus will take a bite out of the U.S. and global economies, as supply chains linked to China, the epicentre of the outbreak, are shut down.
While U.S. economic fundamentals “remain strong”, the “coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity”, the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.
The central bank “is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy”.
The Fed has not made an inter-meeting rate cut since late 2008, during the global financial crisis.
After the announcement, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the emergency interest rate cut will provide a “meaningful boost to the economy” in the face of the coronavirus epidemic.
But Mr. Powell said it is unclear how long the outbreak will last, acknowledging “a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection, it won't fix a broken supply chain”.
“We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy,” Mr. Powell told a press conference.
Wall Street stocks tumbled in late-morning trading on March 3 after the Fed announcement.

3x3 Olympic basketball qualification put off,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/3x3-olympic-basketball-qualification-put-off/article30984464.ece,"The FIBA 3x3 Olympic basketball qualification tournament has been postponed, on account of the coronavirus that has affected several parts of the world.
The tournament was scheduled to commence at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on March 18. 
The revised schedule has not been decided yet.
A statement from FIBA mentioned that the tournament has been postponed “after careful consideration, due to the ongoing developments of the COVID-19 virus.” Japan, South Korea and Italy — nations badly affected by the coronavirus — were among the competing teams in this tournament. 
 
The postponement causes complications in the Olympic qualification process, as this tournament has to take place before the FIBA 3x3 Universality Olympic qualifier tournament that commences at Budapest (Hungary) on April 24.

Sakshi advances to quarterfinals,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sakshi-advances-to-quarterfinals/article30984385.ece,"Former junior world champion Sakshi Chaudhary (57kg) stunned Asian silver-medallist and fourth seed Nilawan Techasuep of Thailand to enter the quarterfinals of the Asian Olympic Qualifiers for boxing here on Wednesday.
The two-time youth world champion Indian, who is only 19, prevailed in a split verdict against the Asian Games bronze-medallist in an engrossing second-round bout after both the boxers got opening-round byes.
Sakshi will next be up against Korea’s Im Aeji on March 9. Making the semifinals would assure her of a spot in the Tokyo Olympics scheduled in July-August this year.
The opening round was fought on even keel for most part but Sakshi managed to be ahead of her fancied rival.
Techasuep came out all guns blazing in the second round and caught Sakshi off-guard with a barrage of combination straight punches.
The Indian was pushed to the backfoot by the aggressive Thai, whose left jab was particularly eye-catching.
But the judges ruled in Sakshi’s favour in a 3-2 second round verdict. In the final three minutes, Saskhi’s counter-attacks proved enough to trump Techasuep’s consistent aggression.
“I stuck to the strategy of counter-attack through the bout and I think she couldn’t handle it. My coaches had told me not to deviate from the plan and I didn’t,” Saskhi said after the bout.
On Tuesday, the seasoned duo of Gaurav Solanki (57kg) and Ashish Kumar (75kg) advanced to the pre-quarterfinals in the men’s draw.
Commonwealth Games gold-medallist Solanki defeated two-time Kyrgyz national champion Akylbek Esenbek Uulu, while Asian Championship silver-medallist Ashish got the better of Taiwan’s Kan Chia-Wei. 
Ashish will square off against Kyrgyzstan’s Omurbek Bekzhigit Uulu, who has been seeded fourth. 
Solanki, whose CWG gold was in the 52kg division, will be up against top-seeded Uzbek Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov, who got a bye into the second round.
Mirzakhalilov is the reigning world champion in this weight category besides being a gold-medallist at the 2018 Asian Games as well as the Asian Championships. 
The results: Men: First round: 57kg: Gaurav Solanki bt Akylbek Esenbek Uulu (Kyr); 75kg: Ashish Kumar bt Kan Chia-Wei (Tpe).

Facebook, however, denied the report that earlier stated that Calibra wallet will not offer Libra.
“Reporting that Facebook does not intend to offer the Libra currency in its Calibra wallet is entirely incorrect. Facebook remains fully committed to the project,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge.
Several US senators have opposed Facebook’s digital coin, arguing that the social networking giant has been irresponsible with user data privacy. They have even called the digital cryptocurrency Libra “delusional” and “dangerous”.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Congress last October about Libra, defending the idea, but acknowledging the struggles left to overcome.
The Libra Association last year said that that over 1,500 entities indicated interest in joining the Libra project effort since the project was announced on June 18, 2019.

"After memes, CBSE now releases ‘exam anthem’ for students",https://www.thehindu.com/society/cbse-releases-exam-anthem-for-students/article30981640.ece,"Look who is vamping up its Gen-Z connect. As board exams for Class X and XII students across India are underway, CBSE’s new ‘exam anthem’ is doing the rounds in student-teacher WhatsApp groups. 
Though admittedly, it’s mostly enthusiastic teachers forwarding the song to wary students. 
The song, on YouTube, samples rapper Emiway’s ‘Machayenge’ and changes its lyrics to (hold your breath) ‘Padhenge’ (We will study).
 In the video, as purple bars ebb and rise during the chorus beats, the square CBSE logo — that most of us associate with the Maths textbooks — thumps into view. The surprisingly thoughtful lyrics remind students that marks are not the only measure for success, and that there are many careers to choose from, including dance, teaching and design.
 Students however, in all cynicism, seem to suspect this video is the aftermath of the Physics paper, which many claim was one of the toughest in recent years — there is even a Change.org petition demanding lenient checking.







Despite students snickering at what they call a ‘boomer’ attempt to be cool, CBSE has been trying its best to motivate through the Gen-Z language of memes. A scroll through their Twitter this February looks much like an aunt trying desperately to connect with adolescent nephews and getting only sarcasm in response. But then, it’s exam time and stress is high. 
Incidentally, the music industry seems to be taking the student audience seriously. In December 2019, Sony Music released a student anthem by Naezy and Dub Sharma, called ‘Let’s Crack It’ which garnered not only some 15 million views, but the most elusive of all: the respect of a teen. 
We hope you reach there too, CBSE. Keep trying, we’re sure that one meme to win them all is not far away.",society

This is about 11% of the total estimated dues of ₹1,46,336.98 crore, leaving ₹1,30,440.47 crore still to be paid ahead of the next Supreme Court hearing on the issue on March 17. 
Replying to a query on whether the government proposed to take any action over non-compliance of order on payment of dues, Minister of State for Communications Sanjay Dhotre said the government had directed the licensees to make the payments in accordance with the October 24, 2019, Supreme Court order.
“As per the licence agreement, the government takes action against licencees, including telecom service providers, over non-compliance of the Supreme Court order dated October 24, 2019, on payment of dues to the Department of Telecommunication,” he said in a written reply to Lok Sabha.
Asked if the government intended to propose a plan for future developments in the telecom sector, keeping in mind the huge fees required to be paid by the companies, he said there was no such plan at present. On a query over speculation about Vodafone Idea shutting down, he said, “No such information is available with the government.”
As per the data shared by the Minister, Vodafone Idea has paid ₹3,500 crore as against its estimated liabilities of ₹53,038.60 crore, Reliance Communication paid ₹3.96 crore as against its estimated liabilities of ₹21,135.64 crore, and Reliance Jio has paid ₹195.18 crore, which is in excess of its estimated AGR dues of ₹60.52 crore.
For Bharti Airtel (including Telenor), the Minister said a payment of ₹10,000 crore was made as against estimated liabilities of ₹27,740.36 crore. However, this does not reflect the additional payment of ₹8,004 crore by the company on February 29. Likewise, for Tata Group, the government said it had received a payment of ₹2,197.37 crore as against estimated liabilities of ₹11,625.92 crore.

SC order on cryptocurrency will offer only temporary relief,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sc-order-on-cryptocurrency-will-offer-only-temporary-relief/article30984157.ece," Even as virtual currency investors and businesses welcomed the Supreme Court’s order on cryptocurrency, the relief for such players may be only temporary given that the Centre, in a draft law, has proposed to ban all private cryptocurrencies.
“... Our main objective is to create a dialogue with policymakers and develop a comprehensive framework for crypto assets in India paving the way for innovation,” said, Sohail Merchant, CEO, Pocketbits.in, and member of IAMAI’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee. “As an industry body, we look forward to a more open dialogue with the government.” IAMAI was among entities that had approached the Supreme Court in 2018 over the RBI circular prohibiting regulated entities from “providing any service in relation to virtual currencies, including those of transfer or receipt of money in accounts relating to the purchase or sale of virtual currencies.”
Welcoming the order, industry body Nasscom tweeted, “We believe that banning #tech is not the solution, a risk-based framework must be developed to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens.”
Noting that the government’s draft framework for regulating the cryptocurrencies proposes to ban all cryptocurrencies outright except a state-issued one, Rachit Sharma, DGM, Taxmann, said the Supreme Court’s order could be a temporary relief for the investors and intermediaries.
He added the Centre may introduce the bill in the Parliament to permanently ban the cryptocurrencies and to set up the basic infrastructure required to issue state-owned cryptocurrency and the digital rupee.
“Until then, all intermediaries and banks, which were forced to shut down platforms providing the trading of cryptocurrencies, are free to operate in India,” Mr. Sharma said.
G.V. Anand Bhushan, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., added the challenge ahead will be to strike a balance between innovation and the need to regulate these newer technologies which are not always used for lawful activities. 
L. Viswanathan, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said the RBI may reconsider its approach to cryptocurrency and come up with a calibrated framework that deals with the reality of these technological advancements, given that even central banks across the world were issuing their own cryptocurrencies.
“We are quite excited about the ban being lifted, which is a much-awaited relief for us and the entire crypto community. It’s such a morale booster and will definitely help us bring back the high-volume traders who were concerned about the tips involved in our P2P transaction system, and have been unable to transact small amounts....we are confident that this verdict would give rise to a greater ecosystem in a country where innovation has always had a place, and rope in new investors, better support for blockchain-based projects, and eventually, create more jobs in India” said Gaurav Dahake, CEO, Bitbns, a cryptocurreny exchange.
Likewise, Zac Cheah, CEO, Pundi X said, “The Apex Court of India lifting the ban on crypto only reinforces the fact that crypto and blockchain are the technologies of the future... India is the second largest user of Pundi X’s blockchain wallet... allowing cryptocurrency transactions will increase our user base and will bring more and more consumers into the fold of digital payments.”",business

Power Grid Corp was slapped with ₹21,953.65 crore liability and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd faced ₹15,019.97 crore demand. RailTel and Delhi Metro too faced similar demands.

The surplus bandwidth capacity available with the company was leased out to the telecom operators/other users, on which the company regularly paid the applicable license fee to the telecom department (DoT).
But, after the October 24 Supreme Court ruling for including non-telecom revenues for calculating dues, the DoT included all revenues from oil and gas to seek ₹48,489 crore from the company for the period from 2007-08 to 2018-19.
In case of GAIL, which held a IP-II licence, the DoT assessed ₹1,83,076 crore as outstanding after including interest and penalty computed on the entire revenue of the company.

The AIOVA had alleged abuse of market dominance against Flipkart India Pvt Ltd, which is into wholesale trading/distribution of books, mobiles, computers and related accessories, and e-commerce marketplace Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd.
The CCI had ruled that looking at the present market construct and structure of online marketplace platforms in India, “it does not appear that any one player in the market is commanding any dominant position at this stage of evolution of market”.",business
Saudi Arabia’s first film festival postponed due to fears over coronavirus outbreak,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/saudi-arabias-first-film-festival-postponed/article30983769.ece,"The baby of the international film festival circuit, the Red Sea International Film Festival (RSIFF), will take a while longer to be born. Saudi Arabia’s first ever film festival, that was to be held in Old Town Jeddah from March 12-20, now stands postponed due to concerns over the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak. The news came on Tuesday, just a few hours after the cancellation of the Doha Film Institute’s coveted mentoring event, Qumra, in Doha, Qatar. Tuesday was also when the Thessaloniki Documentary Film Festival announced deferment, just days before the event was to have launched on March 5 to run through March 15.

In view of a major outbreak in Iran, the postponement of the Fajr International Film Festival, that was initially slated for April 16-24, was announced on Wednesday. Mid-February, one of the oldest Asian festivals, the Hong Kong International Film Festival, previously scheduled for late March-early April, announced its rescheduling to summer.

The winter events like the Sundance and Rotterdam film festivals may have remained relatively unaffected, but concerns around the coronavirus started gaining ground at the Berlinale in February, where an advisory on precautions was brought out. Now, as with the rest of the world, the high profile spring and summer film festivals appear to have been badly hit by SARS-CoV-2, more so given the fast-moving, unpredictable, day-to-day changes in the situation.

While Hillary Rodham Clinton still features in the list of major speakers, a number of companies, including Twitter and Facebook, have cancelled plans for the edgy South by South West (SXSW) festival, which is to take place March 13-22 at Austin, Texas. While the festival has issued an attendee safety advisory, one of the residents has launched a petition on change.org, urging cancellation of the SXSW in light of SARS-CoV-2. Whether the event will carry on regardless or not is anyone’s guess for now.
Meanwhile, in an official announcement, the festival director of RSIFF, Mahmoud Sabbagh, said that the difficult decision of postponement was taken while being mindful of the current global health emergency, “our primary consideration being the safety and well-being of our guests, staff and audiences”. “We remain optimistic, passionate, and committed to what this event means for Saudi Arabia, the Arab world, and the global film community, and hope you can share in this outlook — despite the trying short-term situation,” he said.
“Due to the current global alert regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, the decision comes as part of the Institute’s contribution to manage and reduce the risk of further spread of the virus. This was a very difficult decision, and although Qumra is an important event for our community and industry delegates, their safety and well-being remains our first priority. In order to reduce the risks to our guests in light of increasing global concerns over COVID-19, we are taking precautionary measures to proactively manage potential risks,” said the Doha Film Institute’s statement.
While Thessaloniki is looking at end May/beginning June for possible new dates, most of the postponed 2020 editions of the festivals are yet to work out a feasible alternative. The rescheduling will have to take cognisance of the choc-a-block festival calendar in which getting a suitable window can be a Herculean task. Also the festivals will have to figure whether their current line-up of films will still hold water a few months down the line, and if the celebrity guests would still be available at another date. The RSIFF jury was being headed by filmmaker Oliver Stone and Spike Lee was scheduled to take a masterclass at the festival, while Claire Denis was to be one of the mentors at Qumra.
Meanwhile the coronavirus’ shadow is already looming large over the biggest of them all, the Cannes Film Festival. Hours after news of the first COVID-19 case in Cannes broke out on February 28, a spokesperson told Variety magazine that while it was still premature to express assumptions on an event scheduled in two months and a half, the festival was “monitoring carefully the developments and the latest guidelines provided by the local, national and international authorities” and “is in direct link with the Alpes-Maritimes’ administrative office”.
“In due course and depending on the occurrences, the Festival de Cannes will naturally take all the necessary measures, aiming at ensuring the protection of all attendees and preserving their health during the event in Cannes, under the responsibility of public authorities, in particular the State and the City of Cannes,” the spokesperson told Variety. The festival had been watchful and vigilant while going on in the face of the SARS epidemic in 2003. The Festival de Cannes is scheduled to be held May 12-23 and the line-up of films is expected to be announced in mid-April.",movies
Sanjay Mishra on his next film 'Kaamyaab': 'This is the story of my industry – which I live and breathe',https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sanjay-mishra-on-his-next-film-kaamyaab-this-is-the-story-of-my-industry-which-i-live-and-breathe/article30983759.ece,"A strong breeze passes through the outside seating of the eighth floor at the Red Chillies Entertainment office in Santa Cruz. Actor Sanjay Mishra jokingly asks if I’m allergic to cigarettes before starting to light one. But a gust of wind thwarts his attempts. With the cigarette lit and perched between his fingers, he sits back in a chair, setting the tone for an interview in Hindi that’s relaxed, free-wheeling, and clearly being guided by a story teller.
This week, the actor will be seen in Hardik Mehta’s Kaamyaab – a story about a 65-year-old bit-part actor, played by Mishra, returning from retirement to do his 500th role. “Sudheer is a bad actor,” Mishra says about his character, suddenly breaking into a cackle – acting out the caricature of an evil villain laughing, “He plays those mediocre, stereotyped roles.” Mishra adds that Sudheer, who saw popularity in the 70s and 80s has to relearn his space in contemporary Indian cinema. “He struggles with that. Ek bujhte hue diye ko vaapas se jalane ki koshish hai – Kaamyaab (It’s an attempt to rekindle a dimming lamp).”
For Mishra, playing Sudheer was a no-brainer, “Because this is the story of my industry – which I live and breathe. This is my own story.” Mishra himself has often been a face within ensemble casts. The National School of Drama graduate found immense popularity with his comedic roles in ensemble films – whether on the sitcom Office Office (2001) as Shukla, in Rohit Shetty’s Golmaal series, or Indra Kumar’s Dhamaal (2007). But he proved to be just as comfortable in serious roles – like the conservative father in Masaan (2015) – and also as a protagonist – whether as Bauji, the patriarch of a joint family in Rajat Kapoor’s Ankhon Dekhi (2014), or a blind farmer in Kadvi Hawa (2017). But Mishra is no stranger to being labelled a “character actor”.
“It’s not the audiences [who slot actors this way], it’s the makers,” he says, “These [labels] came up in the 70s and 80s when a kind of film was popular – with one hero and one heroine who fell in love.” But Mishra adds that he’s both relieved and excited to see cinema change increasingly – to focus on being content-oriented and pivoting around more layered characters instead of formulae. He points to Kaamyaab as an example.
While Sudheer in the film gets wrapped up in numbers, I ask Mishra how many films he has done, and he says simply, “I don’t count the rotis I eat, nor do I do work by counting [my roles], but someone had mentioned to me, 173.’” Despite the years being packed with releases, Mishra ensures he takes a pause frequently. It’s a habit that may have found its roots over a decade ago when Mishra had to recover from the sudden passing of his father, around the release of the comedy Aloo Chaat (2009).
“I wanted to leave everything,” he says about the time, “I had gone blank – there was a vacuum in my life. I had been cast in that role,” he says explaining that he had recently recovered from a difficult illness when he lost his father unexpectedly. Mishra remembers asking his father’s friend at the funeral, “When did the casting change?”
The actor then withdrew to Rishikesh and worked in a dhaba, before his family and director Rohit Shetty asked him to return to the life he had left. But Mishra still ensures he takes frequent breaks, “To find that emptiness. It’s important to pause for a minute and just think about who you are, where you’ve reached, where you’re headed. Think about those around you.” He often seeks out unknown faces who don’t know him either, and has uninhibited conversations with strangers.
 It’s this trait of listening that makes him feel close to Bauji, his character in Ankhon Dekhi, “Because he says listen, look, learn,” since Bauji chooses to only believe in what he sees, and nothing else. With genuine conviction he adds Sudheer to this list of characters that resonate with him deeply.
Wrapping up, the actor rattles off a long list of films he’ll soon be seen in – Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Gwalior, Death on a Sunday, 108 Limited, Colour Black, and Holy Cow. On how he singles out his projects, Mishra says, “There’s no thinking behind it. Whichever feels close to the heart – every film [becomes] a turning point for me.”",movies

The Netflix series showcases the journey of a female constable discovering her power as a woman while taking down a drug cartel. The trailer of the series was released on Wednesday.

She revolves around Bhumika Pardesi, a Mumbai police constable who is sent on the streets as an undercover prostitute to take down the drug lord, and somehow, gets caught in the dangerous crossfire.
Aaditi will be seen in the lead role of Bhumika. 
“She is a powerful story about a female constable who is made to go undercover to bring down a drug cartel,” Aaditi said. 
“In the line of duty, my character Bhumika discovers herself — her sexuality and her own power in the truest sense. This role has definitely been one of the most challenging and complex one that I have played so far. I’m thankful that Imtiaz chose me to bring this amazing character to life,” she added.
It also stars Vijay Verma as Sasya, Vishwas Kini as Jason Fernandes amongst others.

Hrithik Roshan: ‘I’m looking at the entire world for a good script’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hrithik-roshan-im-looking-at-the-entire-world-for-a-good-script/article30981359.ece,"I couldn’t brush my teeth properly in seven minutes. Yet that is all the time Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan could spare for an interaction. 
The star, last seen in the action film War, had flown to Chennai to launch Rado’s True Square design watches at Express Avenue. I get to meet Hrithik an hour before he sets off to the venue, at Taj Connemara. As his entourage guides the way into a large hall, I come across the man posing for cameras against a black backdrop; he is sporting an unbuttoned denim jacket that reveals a white, round neck vest which he has paired with jeans and a pair of white shoes.
Now Hrithik, for those who keenly follow his social media accounts, is well aware of his status as a style icon. So, naturally, when I grab a chair and sit next to him, I had to remark that it takes someone of his stature to carry off plain denim so fashionably well in 2020. He smiles. “I don’t know, man. I really don’t know fashion. I just wear whatever my stylist picks and see if I’m comfortable with it. If I am, then I go with it,” he says. That can’t be true. “I want to be a fashion student. I want to learn. It needs work and time. It is not easy. I’m picking up things here and there.” Perhaps that explains the pictures of him in a towel, which he shared a couple of days ago and for which he cited Ranveer Singh as inspiration. 
 Into his seventh year as the face of Rado, the actor says that the watches have helped him “articulate” some aspects of his character.
Learning curveHrithik Roshan likes being a part of ensemble films. “I like the experience. I think all the films that I have done which were two-hero subjects or ensemble films are what I cherish the most... like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, even War with Tiger [Shroff]. It is because you work with good people and you are less alone, as opposed to being alone on the boat and having to row it across the river by yourself,” he laughs, and adds: “You have company and you share the responsibility as well.”
 Yet it has taken him over two decades, since making his debut as lead actor in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), to realise the possibilities of evolving. The actor confides that he prefers to have less filters about him. “I have a new-found joy in being a little more unfiltered... little reckless too, perhaps, as opposed to becoming the kind of person that you know will be liked,” he laughs, and adds: “As actors, you tend to do that. You filter all the negatives out to fit yourself and retain the things that you know have been proven to work, and [make you feel] loved.”

One way of him trying to make a change for himself is by pushing his boundaries. Which is why the actor recently signed up with The Gersh Agency, a talent firm based in Beverly Hills, California. 
“To be honest, I’m looking at the entire world for a good script. [I want] to be in an environment where I would get to learn something new... one that would challenge me, would make me want to wake up and be wide-eyed... you know, like a student. That is how I want to be on the [film] set. I detest the fact that I could be on a set this day and be the one everyone looks up to,” he says.
An interesting comment, I observe, and Hrithik corrects it a bit. “I don’t detest it but I think it really mars my personal growth. I want to learn. Hopefully, with Gersh, or with Hollywood, I may get those chances. I look for them even here and those are the kind of films I end up doing,” he adds.
The star asserts that it cannot be misconstrued as Hrithik assuming that he has hit a ceiling in Bollywood. “I’m just looking at the potential. There is a probability that if I’m with people in a new environment, and who have been in the business for far more years than our industry has even existed... there are more chances of me being even more wide-eyed. It is not that I want to be a Hollywood star. That’s not my aim at all. I’m just looking for a good script,” he notes.
Since last year’s War, which took the best opening of the star’s career, Hrithik has been on a sort of break, “reading scripts and watching a lot of films”. But he is also getting ready to film Krrish 4, the third film in the superhero spin-off of his 2003 hit Koi... Mil Gaya, though he does not divulge any details. “We are just working on it right now,” he smiles. The actor has been known to push his fitness to a superhuman level when filming the franchise. He has also hurt himself in the process of filming stunts for his films. Such freak injuries could be a thing of the past for Hrithik, who last underwent a surgery for subdural haematoma that he sustained in a fly-boarding stunt sequence while filming Bang Bang! (2014).
“I’ve put myself in harm’s way a lot of times for films like Krrish and Dhoom 2. But there is complete safety now. The technology is so wonderful that you never really need to put yourself at risk. You just need to have a certain level of fitness, which is what I’m aspiring for,” he says.
Being fit, though, means more for the actor. “It means to be the best version of myself. [Fitness] for me is not really about the biceps and the six pack abs. It is really about living a life that is wholesome. Fitness is the best way to get to that point,” he concludes.",movies
Sidharth Malhotra to star in Hindi remake of Arun Vijay’s ‘Thadam’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sidharth-malhotra-to-star-in-hindi-remake-of-arun-vijays-thadam/article30980212.ece,"Actor Sidharth Malhotra will star in the Hindi remake of Tamil hit Thadam, the makers announced Wednesday.
 The yet-to-be-titled action thriller will hit the theatres on November 20.
 To be directed by debutant Vardhan Ketkar, the movie is jointly produced by Bhushan Kumar and Murad Khetani.
 Sidharth, who will once again be seen in a double role, said he was looking forward to working on the film.
“Double trouble! Excited to be a part of this ultimate entertaining thriller, in association with @itsbhushankumar, @MuradKhetani and #VardhanKetkar. See you at the movies on 20th November, 2020,” the Marjaavaan star wrote on Twitter.
 This is Sidharth’s third film in which he will be seen in a dual role after A Gentleman (2017) and his upcoming release Shershaah, based on the life of Kargil hero Captain Vikram Batra.
 Starring Arun Vijay in the lead, 2019’s Thadam is a murder mystery. Things get interesting when the murder accused is found to have a lookalike. The Tamil film also starred Tanya Hope, Smruthi Venkat, and Vidya Pradeep.
 Bhushan, who is collaborating with Murad for a fourth time, said working with the co-producer is always a fun experience.
“We both share the same love and passion for films and hence our collaborations have always been successful. When Murad bhai mentioned about ‘Thadam’ and post reading the hindi script, it was an instant yes from my side. It was an unanimous choice to get Sidharth on board as a lead and he will surprise the audiences in this film. Vardhan has worked with one of the best directors in the industry and he is apt to lead this project,” the producer said.
 Murad said he watched Thadam when it released and loved the film, which is based on real incidents.
“So much so that I approached the Tamil makers and immediately bought the rights for the Hindi remake of the film. Sidharth Malhotra was my first choice and when I approached him, he instantly agreed to come on board. I share a wonderful relationship with ‘Bhushanji’, after the success of ‘Kabir Singh’, this is our fourth collaboration with T-Series including ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2’, Sandeep Vanga’s next and now ‘Thadam’,” he added.

The song, sung by Vishal Dadlani, was launched on Wednesday.
Homi Adajania, director of the film, said he was overwhelmed with the gesture by all these actors.
“The Angrezi Medium journey has been unlike anything I’ve experienced. It’s been made with so much love and positivity and this video takes the spirit ahead. It’s a glimpse of what love and positivity looks like. These are beautiful people who gave us time with little notice, selflessly pitched in and I love them for this,” Homi said in a statement here.
Katrina said everyone in the film industry should stand by each other.
“Irrfan and Homi are two of my most favourite people, so when he called me there was no question of me not stepping in. I feel that when we can be there for someone, we should. That’s how it should be in our industry,” she said.
“Irrfan sir has given all of us so much and we want to see him back soon and in the best health possible,” Janhvi said.
Alia said when she listened to “Kudi Nu...”, the song made her want to fly and dance.

This is just another pat on the back for Pradeep Machiraju. In fact, it is an offshoot of the efforts he takes to look good on television. “I spend time with my stylist and pick my colours and clothes. Most youngsters follow television trends and some of them might even want to look like you, so I go with the complete package,” says the TV host, who is making his big-screen début with 30 Rojullo Preminchatam Yela that is releasing shortly. 
On what made him shift gears, Pradeep says, “I’ve always wanted to be an all-rounder. I grabbed the offer when director Munna told me about 30 Days lo Preminchatam Yela.” Pradeep insists that he will pick subjects that are ‘different’. 
In 30 Days lo... he plays two characters. “It talks about some people who are in a situation where they have to work it out in 30 days. In other words, what if the same love story that happened in the past, repeats itself in 2020?”
Turning TV host was a natural choice for an extrovert like him. “In the entertainment industry, the fame comes with a sense of responsibility, it becomes a serious job. After Engineering, I was sure I wanted to do something in a creative field and looked for work for a year. I attended events and got a job as an RJ. My parents were very supportive. Being an RJ is not about talking whatever comes to your mind. There is a decent amount of research to be done and a message has to be passed in an entertaining way without sounding preachy. You get to be a friend to so many unknown faces and I did it for two years.”
 Pradeep moved to television at a time when Suma, Jhansi, Udaya Bhanu, Ohmkar and Prabhakar were popular names. He resolved to be himself and addressed people according to their age groups.

Bond yields decline on expectation of rate cut,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/bond-yields-decline-on-expectation-of-rate-cut/article30984126.ece,"After the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced interest rates on Tuesday to fight the economic slowdown due to the spread of COVID-19, there is growing expectation in the domestic market that the Reserve Bank will follow suit.
Bond yields softened on Wednesday amid rate cut hopes, with the yield on the 10-year government bond dropping 12 bps to close the day at 6.23%.
“We note other Asian central banks have already been easing on account of expected supply-led growth disruptions, while the RBI has been stealth easing via [long-term repo operation], partly as high inflation inhibited conventional easing,” Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Edelweiss Securities, said. 
“However, as we argued post another sluggish GDP print last week, RBI could now front-load its impending rate cuts and could further the LTROs by as early as end March,” Ms. Arora said.
After cutting interest rates by 135 bps between February and October 2019, the central bank has hit the pause button. At the same time, it introduced long-term repo operationsthrough which it lends to banks at rates cheaper than prevailing market rates. “Coordinated easing measures taken by central banks open up an opportunity for RBI to look at easing. The correction in crude oil prices would help push inflation down, allowing RBI to look through the transient inflationary forces which had forced it to ‘pause’ last time. Interest rate sensitive sectors viz., banking, auto, real estate and housing finance would [benefit],” said Pankaj Bobade, head — Fundamental Research, Axis Securities.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Tuesday’s Fed cut supported the call of a 50 bps RBI rate cut in 2020. 
“We see 50 bps risk to [first half of 2020] growth if the COVID infection worsens. As it is, we see FY20 growth at 4.9% and FY21 at 5.6%,” BofaML said in a note, adding that rate cut could happen during the June-August and Oct.-Dec. periods.
“We expect the RBI to inject $45 billion of durable liquidity in FY21, to pull down lending rates,” it added.

COVID-19 | SEBI says gauging virus impact,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/sebi-says-gauging-virus-impact/article30984179.ece," The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is assessing the possible impact of COVID-19 on the markets and taking steps to tackle the same, said S. K. Mohanty, whole-time member, SEBI.
“SEBI is aware of the coronavirus and the possible impact that it can have on the market. We are taking necessary steps,” he said. on the sidelines of a capital market summit organised by industry body Assocham.
“We’ve seen the RBI statement. Whatever has to be done, has to be done. We are internally assessing the situation,” he added.
The SEBI statement comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it was monitoring the financial markets closely on account of the virus scare.
Asked if the issue had been discussed at the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), which has representations from all regulatory bodies, the SEBI member said, ‘not yet.’
The impact of COVID-19 in India has been visible in most segments of the markets, including equities, currency and bonds. 
Incidentally, the last few trading sessions had seen the benchmark Sensex shedding more than 3,000 points while the rupee went past the 73-mark on Tuesday and bond yields dropped 11 bps on Wednesday.
 On a different note, the capital markets regulator has taken up with the government the issue of taxation with respect to dividends from real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).
A Budget proposal has made dividends from such structures taxable, which, market participants believe, would be a huge dampener for the segment.
“...the taxation part is not in the hands of SEBI, but we have taken it up with the government, let’s hope for the best,” said Mr. Mohanty.
“If that (change or amendment) happens, if we stick to the taxation incentive to REITs and InvITs given in 2016, if that is restored, then definitely billions of dollars India would get and will help our economy in a great way,” he added.",economy

Banks’ merger to come into effect from Apr 1, says Sitharaman 
On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet approved the proposal to amend 65 sections of the Act. “The priority is to remove sections which criminalise offences which may not have been intended to be malafide,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told journalists after a Cabinet meeting.
She outlined proposed changes to 52 out of 66 compoundable offences under the Act, either removing them entirely, downgrading penalties from jail sentences to fines or suggesting alternative adjudication mechanisms.
 The Centre proposes to recategorise 23 offences so that they can be dealt with through an in-house adjudication framework, while five types of offences will be dealt with under different alternative frameworks. 
Another seven will be omitted altogether. Most of these are procedural or technical defaults that lack the element of fraud or do not affect larger public interest, according to an official statement.
For 11 kinds of offences, the provision of imprisonment will be removed, limiting punishment to fines only. Six offences that had already been decriminalised earlier will see a further reduction in the quantum of penalties.
The proposed amendments will also ensure that companies which have an obligation to spend ₹50 lakh per annum or less on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are no longer required to have a CSR committee. Companies that spend more than the mandatory 2% on CSR in a particular year can carry it forward as credit for fulfilment of CSR obligations for the next few years as well, she said.
The changes are “expected to significantly enhance the confidence of Indian corporates in the government’s resolve to provide greater ease [of doing business] and accord highest respect to honest wealth creators in the country and reduce the burden on the justice system,” said an official statement. The amendments are based on the recommendations of a high-level panel set up in September 2019.

"Banks’ merger to come into effect from Apr 1, says Sitharaman ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/banks-merger-to-come-into-effect-from-apr-1-says-sitharaman/article30981225.ece," Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said the exercise of consolidation of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four is on course and the merger will come into effect from April 1, 2020.
 The Union Cabinet, she said, has given a go-ahead for the merger proposal and the government has been in regular touch with these banks.
 There will be no regulatory issues, she said. 
“The banks’ merger is on course and decisions have already been taken by the respective bank boards,” she told reporters here.
 The mergers are aimed at creating global sized banks in India.
 In the biggest consolidation exercise in the banking space, the government in August 2019 had announced four major mergers of public sector banks, bringing down their total number to 12 from 27 in 2017, a move aimed at making state-owned lenders global sized banks.
 United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce will be merged with Punjab National Bank; Syndicate Bank will be merged with Canara Bank; Allahabad Bank will be amalgamated with Indian Bank; and Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will be consolidated with Union Bank of India.
 Last year, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank were merged with Bank of Baroda. Prior to this, the government had merged five associate banks of SBI and Bharatiya Mahila Bank with the State Bank of India. ",economy

Banks’ merger to come into effect from Apr 1, says Sitharaman 
Claiming that the proposed amendments were aimed at improving the ease of doing business, Ms. Sitharaman explained: ""Out of 66 compoundable offences under the Act, 23 will get recategorised so that they can be dealt with through in-house adjudication framework, seven have been omitted altogether, 11 will have limited punishment in the form of fines alone by removing imprisonment provision, five will be dealt with under different alternative frameworks, six which had earlier been decriminalised will now have reduced quantum of penalties.""
The proposed amendments will ensure that companies which have an obligation to spend Rs. 50 lakh per annum or less on corporate social responsibity (CSR) are no longer required to have a CSR committee. Companies which spend over the obligated 2% on CSR in a particular year can carry it forward as credit for fulfilment of CSR obligations for the next few years as well.
In November, a government-appointed high level panel proposed decriminalising more than half of the existing compoundable offences under the companies law as well as lower monetary penalties for violations by startups, amid efforts to further improve the ease of doing business in the country.
This is the second amendment being made to the companies Act in the last one year. The Act was amended in July last year to tighten Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) norms and ensure stricter action for non-compliance of the company law regulations.",economy

The market breadth was extremely weak with nearly 1,800 stocks losing ground on BSE, as against only 639 gainers.
“The rise in coronavirus cases dented sentiment and triggered a sharp decline in the middle,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president — Research, Religare Broking. “However, it rebounded in the latter half, considerably trimming losses,” he said.

“The recent surge in the coronavirus cases outside China has spooked the investors’ sentiment across the globe... the surprise rate cut by the U.S. Fed failed to cheer the participants and in fact, it has raised doubts about the health of the U.S. economy,” added Mr. Mishra.
Incidentally, the fall in the Indian indices came amidst a mostly positive trend in the Asian markets that rallied on the back of a surprise 50 basis points rate cut by U.S. Federal Reserve.

 Ashish prevailed 5-0 to set up a clash with Indonesia’s Maikhel Roberrd Muskita, who defeated New Zealand’s Ryan Scaife in his pre-quarterfinal bout. 
Making the semifinals would assure Ashish of his maiden spot in the Olympics this year.
 Up against a spunky rival, who he defeated in the Asian quarterfinals last year, Ashish played the waiting game to perfection, allowing Uulu to expend himself trying to connect.
 Uulu swung his arms more than the Indian but it was Ashish who connected more accurately in the opening three minutes.
 However, Uulu kept up the pressure in the second round as well and managed to land a couple of solid rights, which caught the Indian off-guard and led to scores being split.
 Ashish’s powerful and precise right hand served him well in the final three minutes as judges ruled unanimously in his favour.

“Performing at the highest level in sports require adaptability. Coronavirus or no, they are going to the Olympics. This is a situation which is new for everybody and they need to adapt to it and prepare to the best of their abilities” Bindra said at the launch of Boria Majumdar and Nalin Mehta’s book, Dreams of a Billion.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief, Thomas Bach, had earlier encouraged athletes to continue their preparations at ‘full steam’. And Bindra is of a similar opinion. “The Games are being prepared to be on scheduled as the IOC chief said yesterday. The best experts are monitoring the situation, there will be a time when there will be clarity. No point in speculating on whether Games will be postponed,” Bindra said.
He is also confident of Indians faring well in Tokyo. “The current lot of athletes are young and fearless. I think that’s a very happy space to be in,” said Bindra, revealing that some of them do seek his advise.
“What I can tell them is my experiences, things that I did wrong, things that I learnt. At the end of the day, they have to find their way. They just can’t follow me and copy what I did. If they have to succeed, they have to find their path,” Bindra said. “I am very open if they seek my opinion. I will not actively try to put something into their minds. But if I am asked, I am more than happy to share my experiences.”",other sports
Former TT champion Bindu in elite panel of Blue Badge umpires,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/former-tt-champion-bindu-in-elite-panel-of-blue-badge-umpires/article30993710.ece," Former State table tennis champion M.S. Bindu has become a trail-blazer for women umpires in the State after she was made it to the International Table Tennis Federation’s (ITTF) elite panel of Blue Badge umpires. 
The 38-year-old became the first woman from Kerala and second from India to be selected to the coveted panel. Bindu, who had represented Kerala in 11 senior national TT championships, also became the second Blue Badge umpire from Kerala.
Blue badge umpires officiate in ITTF’s elite tournaments including the Olympics and World Championships. Bindu qualified as international umpire in 2012 even when she was active as a player. 
However, she became a full-time umpire only after retirement and the 78th senior national championships in Haryana in 2016 was her first major assignment.
She was nominated by the ITTF to officiate in the premium junior circuit in Metz, France, in April last year which was her first international assignment. She appeared for the Blue Badge test and passed the written exam in Metz. 
She officiated in the Commonwealth championships in Cuttack in July and World Junior championship in Thailand in December. 
Bindu’s performance as umpire in these tournaments was evaluated by ITTF and she passed the interview which was conducted during the World Junior TT championships in Thailand to complete the Blue Badge qualification process within six months 
“She was very hard working and dedicated when she was a player. She has shown the same traits after she became an umpire. 
“It is a great achievement to achieve this within six months as normally people take more time to complete the Blue Badge process. 
“I hope Bindu will inspire more women to take up umpiring,” said N. Ganeshan, ITTF’s competition manger and Bindu’s mentor. 
Bindu, who is married to Kerala State Sports Council coach Jobin Christy, chose to be an umpire rather than a coach after her retirement. “I grew up watching Ganeshan as a umpire. I was always impressed by his dedication and passion and always wanted to be an umpire. 
“He was the first person to encourage me to take up officiating. 
“I should also thank my family and especially husband for all their support,’’ said Bindu who is awaiting her first assignment as a Blue Badge umpire.",other sports
Ailing Novy Kapadia awaits his long-delayed pension,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ailing-novy-kapadia-awaits-his-long-delayed-pension/article30991865.ece,"The plight of noted sports commentator and author Novy Kapadia confined to his home has left the football fraternity sad. Pictures of an otherwise vibrant Kapadia, now unable to move around even within his house without assistance, has distressed many who have known Kapadia for close to four decades.
“What pains me is the fact that Novy has not been paid his pension for more than two years,” said commentator Ghaus Mohammad, Kapadia’s partner on radio and television for more than 30 years. “His service to football is unmatched and it is time the football fraternity lends support to the man who did so much to popularise the game. This generation of football lovers owes it to him. His background of teaching ensured he had a smooth flow in his commentary and impeccable pronunciation,” 
Having covered nine FIFA World Cup tournaments, the 67-year-old Kapadia is considered an authority on football in India. “Football has been a passion for me. It hurts that I can’t do my commentary now but I feel elated when my students visit me and friends drop in,” said Kapadia, who taught English at Khalsa College for 41 years and has been waiting to receive his pension for 31 months. “I have enjoyed my travels for football but now I miss all that. I am not able to step out of the house at all and have to use a walker when moving around. Football took me all over the world but that way of life has sadly come to an end now.” 
Kapadia, who once owned the Ashoka Club and played active football in the local league, has been afflicted by motor neuron, a rare neuro-degenerative disease that causes the nerves in the spine and brain to lose function over time. “I have served Delhi University with all dedication and hope I get help at this stage of my life from the Government to meet my medical expenses,” he pleaded.
According to veteran football scribe Jaydeep Basu, “Novy is one of the finest grass-root reporters of Indian football. He has deep technical knowledge of football and footballers. I envy his understanding of the game and I am sad that he has been sort of neglected by the society. I am sure help will pour in for him to meet his medical expenses,” said Basu.
Football guru for some and football encyclopedia for others, Kapadia awaits to hear from the Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, who has promised to look unto the matter.
Taking note of Kapadia’s condition, All India Football Federation president Praful Patel told The Hindu, “the sports fraternity owes a lot to Novy. AIFF will certainly help him. I will also take it up the Sports Minister.”",other sports

After the judge ordered Levandowski to pay $179 million to Google, the founder of autonomous vehicle startup Otto which Uber acquired later, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, reports TechCrunch.
“Levandowski personally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stating that the presumptive $179 million debt quite exceeds his assets, which he estimates at somewhere between $50 million and $100 million,” the report said.
The case dates back to 2017 when Uber and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, locked horns with each other over the latter’s accusation on the ride-hailing app of stealing its self-driving technology.
Google’s self-driving car unit Waymo filed a lawsuit against Uber in 2017, alleging that the stolen information became the technological basis for Uber’s self-driving cars.

This closed Facebook group for women has evolved as a space for free expression,https://www.thehindu.com/society/her-trivandrum-is-a-closed-facebook-group-for-women-from-across-the-world/article30990233.ece,"
One can’t help but laugh when Radha Nair writes about how her help catches a frog in her bathroom. On another day, the city-based children’s author leaves you teary-eyed when she remembers how she dealt with the assassination of her father, a career diplomat, in Ottawa in 1961. 
If Cindu Vijay, an architect in Kozhikode, inspires you with her never-say-die spirit after she was diagnosed with cancer, Nisha Kiran, a home chef, can give a lesson or two for those dealing with depression.
This is all happening in Her Trivandrum, a private Facebook group for women, originally meant to be a space for women in the capital city “to network and connect with each other”. But one-and-half years down the lane, it has members from across the world and their number stands at 6,750 and counting. 
Anjali Manoj, the lone admin of the group, is happy that it has become THE space for women. On March 7, the eve of International Women’s Day, Anjali launches a new Facebook page, Hers To Share, which can be accessed by all Facebook users. This public page will have those articles posted on Her Trivandrum that the members wish to make public. 






From the first meet-up of Her Trivandrum members held in 2019

Special arrangement  





Looking back at the journey of Her Trivandrum, Anjali, a journalist-educator-entrepreneur, says that some unpleasant experiences on social media forced her to think about launching a women’s forum. 
“Whenever I posted a query, friend requests or unwanted opinions used to pop up often. I even felt unsafe after I got comments on my private messenger. That’s when I hit upon the idea of a closed group where women can ask or express anything, without being judged or questioned. I expected only a few women from the city to join it. But the network just got bigger and bigger with women from across the globe joining in,” says Anjali.
Besides women staying in the city and those who’ve got a connect with it but are not living here, the group has members who have no relation with Thiruvananthapuram as well. And from a forum to seek help or advice related to topics such as family, children, housing, food, fashion, travel, art, culture, nature, business and health, it has evolved into a space to discuss subjects such as depression, relationship goals, mental and physical health, personal insecurities, domestic abuse and more. 
The members, who are between the age of 20 and 70-plus, include homemakers, professionals, self-employed women, entrepreneurs, students, painters, performers, poets and photographers.
“This has evolved as one strong support group as the members encourage one another. There is a positivity in this forum. We have several senior citizens who are active on the platform even though they may not be stepping out of their homes,” Anjali adds. 
According to 73-year-old Radha, the group has introduced her to a lot of “dynamic” women. “There are many whom I admire. It is heart-warming to read stories about women who’ve battled odds and how some of them have just refused to give up. Women feel safe and secure to discuss their problems and ask for recommendations,” says Radha. 
Conditions applyThe group is only for women. A new member is added only if an existing member recommends her name. Only those posts approved by Anjali would be visible on the page. Members can choose not to reveal their identity and can post as ‘Anonymous’. The group doesn’t entertain hate speech, bullying, foul language and posts related to politics and religion. Negative comments and impostors will be removed. Advertisements are allowed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, that too only if there is a proper contact number. Anjali spends 12 to 15 hours a day, starting from 6 am, to check the posts. Even when she is travelling, she keeps a tab on the page. Every day, she approves at least 25 posts, which is less than the number she rejects!
Cindu Vijay, a Kozhikode-based architect, calls Her Trivandrum the “most supportive group” she has come across. Having been part of several women’s forums, Cindu says that she can share those things on the page which she is not comfortable talking on any other platform. “Domestic abuse was one such issue. There is a lot of empathy in the group which is needed instead of sympathy,” says the 52-year-old. 
As for Cauvery Kesavasamy, a freelance writer, it was “the kindred souls on the group” that made her feel at home in the capital city when she returned to live here after a decade. “I got best friends, opportunities to work and even ventured out of my comfort zone when it came to food and social life,” says Cauvery, who recently posted about how she fell down from an electric train onto the railway track. “It was the 10th anniversary of that accident and I felt like revisiting it,” adds the 33-year-old. 
Dubai-based Nithya Rajkumar, a fashion retail professional and photographer, says that she receives constant support and encouragement from the members. “Behind successful women, there are many wise, charming and compassionate women. This has been a space for me to reach out to many people, especially when I was involved in gathering support and goods for those affected by floods in Kerala,” says Nithya. While depression has been a widely-discussed topic, learning disabilities and behavioural issues in children have also been taken up with members coming forward to support each other. 
Gopika Raj, a 24-year-old English teacher from Toulouse, France, feels that the camaraderie within the group makes it a safe platform to share one’s thoughts about anything, without fear of judgements. “The posts are written by women of all ages and are often eye-opening as well as entertaining. It’s beyond beautiful that all of us are doing our humble bit to open up and discuss the simple joys of everyday life, from sharing recipes to bringing up sensitive topics that were kept under wraps for eons,” says Gopika over email, referring to her posts on body positivity and sexuality. “When I wrote about the latter, this heterogeneous tribe of womenfolk were overwhelmingly open minded and understanding. We trust the unthreatening nature of the group enough to let loose our thoughts, into the minds and newsfeeds of others too!” she says. ",society

From the many curated events, says Isabelle, seven events have been designed around show jumping, in which the horses and riders are required to jump (usually within a time limit) over a series of obstacles. There are also events designed for children below the age of 12. 
“We have people joining from the Army and police along with their horses. They will be competing with teenagers and other men and women in the same categories. The competitions are all about how well you have put your skills in place. It has very little to do with physical strength. It is mostly about your focus,” says Isabelle. 
The main show will include the three events for competition: Eventing, Dressage and Jumping. For this, riders from across the city are welcome to register. “So far, 50 horses will compete from CEC and an additional 50 horses have registered from outside the club,” she says. 
The Chennai Horse Show will remain a free event, in an attempt to encourage people to cultivate interest in the sport. “It’s still a very small community. And many people have a lot of misconceptions about the animal and the sport. So we expect that when people see children doing the sport effortlessly, it will generate a lot of interest among the crowds. They are also welcome to interact with the horses and familiarise,” says Isabelle adding that this year, a footfall of 200 to 300 is expected. 
Chennai Horse Show will be held from March 6 to March 8 at Chennai Equitation Centre, Sholinganallur. VIP and family tickets at allevents.in",society
"Kiara Advani: 'Guilty will elicit discomfort in its audience, both during and after its viewing'",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/we-still-have-a-long-way-to-go/article30993453.ece,"A little over a year after the #MeToo movement sparked a revolution, filmmaker Ruchi Narain feels liberated. The 44-year-old firmly believes the phenomenon has encouraged women to talk about things — among themselves and on public platforms — like they never did before. “Forget about a serious incident like assault, I’m talking about simple day-to-day stuff, casual sexism which everyone has to deal with,” says the director with extreme deliberation. Up until recently, micro-aggressions have been largely tolerated, but there’s a change now that cannot be overlooked. “The reason why people haven’t spoken up for years is because they want to get on with their ambitions,” says Narain. “[Women] are here because we want to work, we want to express and create. We are not here to do any activism.”

The director and screenwriter is sitting alongside actor Kiara Advani, talking to The Hindu, about the duo’s upcoming Netflix film Guilty and its position in a post-#MeToo society. Based in a Delhi University milieu, the whodunnit focuses on the perspective of a woman (played by Advani) whose boyfriend is accused of sexual assault.
Likening the hotheadedness of her character to Shahid Kapur’s Kabir Singh (who she starred alongside), Advani prepped for her role by meeting assault survivors. In Guilty, her character Nanki is accused of intimidating the alleged victim, an uncomfortable position in a time when women are expected to stand up for each other. Though the actor faithfully played out Nanki, she’s aware of the politics and complications surrounding the movement, including the magnitude of false accusations. “Of course, we all want justice, but I think there are deeper issues that need to be tackled,” says the 27-year-old actor talking about the perils of a patriarchal society. “It is good that the conversation started, but where is it leading to? I wish I had these answers.”

Narain, who echoes the sentiment, intuitively predicted the public discourse that sexual misconduct would have in the future. Guilty has been the culmination of that foretelling. “I’d told Karan [Johar] I want to write a film about rape seven years ago,” says Narain adding that it was evident to her that there would be a clash between women who have been brought up to be empowered and the current state of society which hasn’t progressed as fast. In the time since, horrific gendered crimes brought problems surrounding women’s safety to the forefront. The #MeToo movement, then becomes an ongoing catalyst in taking the discourse further. “As a woman with so many ambitions, [I] was not able to get to go where I wanted to because of a kind of push back [from society],” says Narain. “I wanted to make a film which tackled the complexities and the confusions not just of women but also men who are part of the same society.”
As our chat winds to an end, both Advani and Narain stress that Guilty will elicit discomfort in its audience, both during and after its viewing. They might not even agree with its resolution. That’s exactly what the director wants so that the important discourse can continue, in spite of the embers of the movement cooling. But before we part, it’s Advani who emphasises, “I feel like women have each others backs now, and we’ve come so far, but we still have a long way to go.”

"Director Hardik Mehta: 'Kaamyaab' is about the connection between the grammar of Hindi cinema, and its audience",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-important-sidekick-is-kaamyaab/article30993430.ece,"Whether it was Lata Mangeshkar’s voice warbling ‘Maar Diya Jaye’ or film composer Gustavo Santaolalla’s haunting strings, director Hardik Mehta always had music playing on his set for Kaamyaab. “See? I always keep a speaker with me,” he laughs, pointing to the portable speaker sitting between us as we chat about his latest film.
His debut feature Kaamyaab releases in theatres this week, after having travelled the festival circuit and premiering at the Busan International Film Festival. The dramedy revolves around Sanjay Mishra’s Sudheer, a 65-year-old has-been side-actor who tries his hand at acting again when he realises he needs one more role to complete a neat filmography of 500 performances. For Mehta, the film is a tribute of sorts to those recognisable faces, popular in the 80s and 90s, whose stories hovered in the margins of the hero’s tale. “I thought why don’t I tell a story about these faces I have grown up seeing?” says the director, “[From] Bob Christo who would be a foreign smuggler [to] Razak Khan [who would appear] chewing paan.”
Delving into the evident typecasting these “character actors” face, Mehta says that in an effort to not waste film reels and save up takes for the lead actors, side-actors would be cast based on characteristics or dialogues that made them popular – reducing the number of takes they would need to get their scene right. “For comedy they would cast Mehmood or Mukri, and if [they wanted] a drunkard, they would call Keshto Mukherjee,” he says. While Kaamyaab offers a light-hearted treatment of these actors’ place in mainstream Hindi cinema, didn’t the director encounter threads of resentment in these stories? He admits that the story came to him a few years ago when he saw Ramesh Goyal on a BEST bus. “He was [with] Aamir Khan in Sarfarosh (1999), [and here] he was fighting with the conductor?” says Mehta, finding the image surreal. During his research for the script, the director spent time with numerous actors including Birbal, Manmauji and the late Viju Khote. But something Goyal mentioned stayed with the director, “He said, “arre hum toh kaamyaabi ke kinaare hi reh gaye, yaar (I got stranded on the banks of success, friend).”
 Although the film’s title is inspired by this forlorn sentiment and the nostalgia of similar 80s Urdu titles, Kaamyaab also declares the actors’ success – being indelible parts of audience’s memories of Hindi cinema. It’s this reminiscence that weaves itself into Mehta’s treatment of the narrative. “[The film] is about the memory of mainstream cinema – the connection between the grammar of Hindi cinema, and its audience,” says Mehta, explaining that the homage to “character artistes” borrows the same language that carved their space in mainstream cinema – from typical music to visuals that were shorthand for emotions and plot points.
Mehta’s love for Bollywood is obvious. But he sought out his love for filmmaking after leaving his work as a dairy technologist for Amul in Surat to become a copywriter. Mehta’s stint as a copywriter made him realise that his love for arts – from photography to music and writing – came together in cinema. “Training as a filmmaker is being interested in other arts,” says the director. Though he went on to make the award-winning documentary short Amdavad ma Famous (2015) and the Amit Sial and Khushboo Upadhyay-starrer The Affair (2017), pursuing filmmaking seemed risky. Everyone around him was buying a car, going to the USA, and settling down. “But I had to take it up,” says the director before chuckling, “so that one day they will all comment on my Facebook saying, ‘Shah Rukh Khan is presenting your film?’”
 Mehta’s directorial process of offering music and photography to draw out performances has found its way on the sets of his next too – the horror-comedy starring Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor Rooh Afza. For the cast and crew, he plays the eerie soundtracks of Pan’s Labyrinth (2006) and Shape of Water (2017). Mehta has also co-written the True Detective-style noir cop drama Patal Lok which is an Amazon series.
Considering that Kaamyaab’s trailer had settled on the YouTube trending page when it was released, I ask Mehta, if he feels the tide has shifted. That is, are character artistes finally getting their due? “I don’t know,” he replies pensively, “Everyone watches everything on YouTube. [And though] I can’t expect a number [of viewers] like Baaghi 3, I’m happy [they release] on the same day. It’s a sign – while Baaghi 3 is your hero, the important sidekick is Kaamyaab.” ",movies
"The characters resonated with me: Tanel Toom, director of 'Truth and Justice'",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-characters-resonated-with-me-tanel-toom-director-of-truth-and-justice/article30991110.ece,"Truth and Justice, director Tanel Toom’s visually stunning epic, spanning the years 1872 to 1896, went on to become the highest grossing film of all time in Estonia, even surpassing The Avengers. The film also made it to the 2020 Oscars shortlist for International Feature Film Award, giving the 37-year-old his second brush with the Academy (he was nominated in 2011 for his short film The Confession).
The film, based on the eponymous 550-page novel written in 1926 by Anton Hansen Tammsaare, tells the story of farmer Andres Paas (Priit Loog) and his wife, Krõõt (Maiken Schmidt), as they arrive at Robber’s Rise to create a new life there. Krõõt isn’t as convinced about the marshy land but still toils alongside her husband. Convinced that a ditch will drain the water, Andres asks his neighbor Pearu (Priit Võigemast) to share the cost, despite warnings that Pearu is not one to be trusted. As life goes on, Andres changes from the man he once was.
Tanel, whose film was screened at BiFFes, spoke to MetroPlus.
Excerpts:
 When I read the book, I was affected by how contemporary the struggles of the novel’s characters were and by how strongly they resonated with my pursuit for self-fulfillment. The way Andres never ceases the non-stop drudgery to acknowledge what he has achieved or to say a good word to his loved ones reminded me a lot of my father. And myself too.
There have been many attempts to make it into a film before. The first year, I was only working on structure and choosing the main events for the film. My intention was to maintain the essence of the story and tell it in the most effective and exciting way.
 Yes, that was one of the things that I was initially excited about – Andres’ character arc and in the end is he a better man than Pearu? We all change. And we do because of the environment, the people we meet, the events and conflicts that happen to and around us. Although Pearu might be one of the most visible reasons, I think he is not the only one who pushes Andres for change. The land that doesn’t obey Andres’s will, the fact that he still hasn’t got an heir... all this creates disappointment. Of course, the nature of the character’s change is not just determined by the external events and conflicts that happen to us but are in close relationship with our nature. We might act very differently in similar situations. Andres is a rational and dogmatic man who is obsessed with justice and being right. This is actually the main source of the conflict as this determines how he deals with Pearu and also with his land.

There are a lot of people who do find consolation and help from the Bible while looking for guidance and answers. But Andres is not looking for answers. He knows he is always right. He just needs proof to show others and to confirm it to himself. And he is using the Bible for that. I think it’s not just about the book but about the person who is reading it. Andres is having a very unhealthy relationship with the Bible. He’s abusing that book. And this is something that has been happening for thousands of years — wars and conflicts because of religion. Sadly, it’s nothing new. 
I was ready to get beaten and kicked out of the country. You have to be. The fact it is based on a well-known book doesn’t guarantee you success. There are even more reasons it might flop as everyone has a version of their own in their heads how this story should be. We were lucky; it did unbelievably well. But filmmaking is always a gamble, you never know the outcome. And I think you need that uncertainty. That keeps you on your toes and pushes you to do a better job. That is important. Because lazy filmmaking is the worst kind of filmmaking.
 I have been in love with India for quite some time now. The food, the culture, the people... This is not my first trip to India but it is my first time in Bangalore. And I love it. My stay was so short and schedule so packed that unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to see many films. But I love Indian movies. I’ve been saying for years that one day I’d really love to do a Bollywood movie. With all the dancing and singing.",movies
Actor Muhammed Musthafa makes his debut as a director with ‘Kappela’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-muhammed-musthafa-on-his-directorial-debut-kappela/article30990727.ece,"Malayalam cinema has many actors who have successfully forayed into direction. Muhammed Musthafa is the latest to join the list. The actor, who won special jury mention at the National Film Awards (2015) for his role as a vulnerable youth in Ain directed by Sidhartha Siva, is making his début as a director with Kappela that reaches theatres today.
He says that the movie “takes up a subject that is relevant.” Without giving anything away about the storyline, he adds, “It’s an issue that the young generation can relate to and therefore the story revolves around a group of youngsters.”
The three main characters are Jessy (Anna Ben), Vishnu (Roshan Mathew) and Roy (Sreenath Bhasi) who hail from different backgrounds. Jessy belongs to a family that is into agriculture in Poovaranmala, on the high ranges of Wayanad.

A happy-go-lucky girl, who hasn’t cleared her Plus Two, Jessy is in love with Vishnu, an autorickshaw driver in Malappuram. Roy is a management graduate from Kannur who is on the lookout for a job. The film begins with Jessy’s journey to Kozhikode to meet Vishnu; Roy lands in the city for a job interview. Their paths intersect, resulting in a series of incidents. In between, the narrative cuts back to the past of the two male characters.
“Besides Kozhikode, the film travels through Wayanad, Malappuram and Kannur as well,” says Musthafa, a native of Kozhikode.
As for naming it Kappela, which means chapel, Musthafa says that he wanted a title that doesn’t have predictability. “However, there is a dilapidated chapel near Jessy’s home, that is special for her in as it is a special space for her,” he adds.
As an actorMusthafa came into the limelight as a contestant of Best Actor, a reality show on Amrita TV. He was active in theatre then alongside pursuing his career as a photographer. He forayed into cinema with Paleri Manickyam…. and have worked in films such as Penpattanam, Sakhavu, Loham, Urumbukal Urangarilla, Gambinos and Sathyam Paranja Viswasikkuvo?
He stresses that a highlight of the movie will be the performances of the lead actors. “Ever since the trailer came out, I have been getting calls complementing me for the choice of the three main actors. Anna was perfect for the role of this girl from a middle class family. Roshan and Sreenath were deliberate choices because they are unpredictable actors. They don’t carry the image of typical heroes and therefore can play any role. People don’t have any preconceived notions about the characters they play,” he adds.
Musthafa adds that it took nearly three years for him to arrive at the final draft of the screenplay in the company of co-writers, Nikhil Vahid and Sudhas V. “The project got pushed also because there was a delay in getting the right cast,” he adds.
The 38-year-old brings with him the experience of assisting Ranjith in Njaan and Loham. “I made my début in cinema in his Paleri Manickyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha. Since I have a background in photography as well, I was always curious about what goes behind the camera. That’s when I evinced interest in assisting him and he took me on board,” he adds.
Since then, Musthafa says, he has been searching for the right script. “The subjects that I had in mind needed a big canvas. I understood that I had to gain more experience to helm those projects. So I decided to start with a simple plot and that’s when I got the thread of Kappela. Even when there were several challenges during the making of the film, what kept me going was the subject itself,” he adds.
Sudhi Koppa, Navas Vallikunnu, Sudheesh and Vijilesh are also in the cast. Sushin Shyam is the composer, with Jimshi Khalid cranking the camera.
“Be it music, cinematography, editing, art direction or sound mixing, I have got the best hands for the job and that makes me happy about the final product,” he says.",movies
Sahir Ludhianvi: Waiting for that dawn... ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sahir-ludhianvi-waiting-for-that-dawn/article30990627.ece,"Daring to express the most complex human emotions, poets are God’s special creatures. Go down the lanes of history, words of rulers have died with them, but verses of poets remain alive as they communicate everlasting truths that most are unable to hear and imbibe. Every age gives rise to a few great poets who make us discern the imponderable mysteries of the universe through a spontaneous overflow of emotions. And without a doubt, in the post-Partition era, such a profound voice was Sahir Ludhianvi.
His unique ability to serve unvarnished truths set Sahir apart as a people’s poet who inspired the finest ideals of mankind and many of his verses such as “Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalman Banega, Insaan Ki Aulaad Hai Insaan Banega” (Dhool Ka Phool) have acquired iconic status because of their lucid distillation of eternal wisdom. His stirring verses like “Ye Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaye To Kya Hai” and “Jinhein Naaz Hai Hind Par Wo Kahan Hain” (both from Pyaasa), “Aurat Ne Janam Diya Mardon Ko, Mardon Ne Usey Bazaar Diya” (Sadhana) or “Wo Subah Kabhi To Aayegi” and “Chino-Arab Hamara, Hindustan Hamara” (both from Phir Subah Hogi) are part of folklore since they knocked hard at social inadequacies as well as political and affluent classes.
Not that he spared the common citizens for their culture of hypocrisy, dogma, and hate. Several songs like “Bane Ho Ek Khaaq Se” (Aarti), “Khuda-e-Bartar Teri Zameen Pe Ye Jung Kyun Hai” (Taj Mahal), “Insaanon Ne Paise Ke Liye” (Paisa ya Pyar) and “Bataa Ae Aasman Wale” (Marine Drive) are critical of their follies! But the masses still adored him because he held a mirror to their anguish as well as shortcomings in a transparently, honest manner.
If a poet is to influence, enlighten and motivate, Sahir did it with remarkable distinction. Even in the throes of passion, this finest of romantic poets did not forget his duties and responsibilities. Ponder over just one sample: his unusual rejoinder “Par Thehar Wo Jo Wahan… Phir Teri Maang Siataron Se Bhari Jayegi” to his beloved when she beckons with “Aaj Ki Raat Badi Shokh Badi Natkhat Hai” (Nayi Umar Ki Nayi Fasal). His bosom is not short of love but devotion to a cause makes him plead with her to “wait till he had built houses for those sleeping on the footpath as well as helped the poor that are denied even shrouds for their corpses”.






Guru Dutt and Mala Sinha in Hindi film ""Pyaasa"".
 






A rarer expression of solace is difficult to find except in Sahir’s “Tum Mujhe Bhool Bhi Jao” (Didi) wherein he reminds the beloved that in a world afflicted with hunger and thirst, love is not the ultimate necessity!
Seeing or reacting in a manner different from the ordinary came naturally to Sahir. Abhorrence to constrictions of social customs, luxury, opulence and decadence made him a rebel of sorts and a saviour of the downtrodden. That is why for him Taj Mahal was not a monument of love but a grotesque advertisement of a king: “Ek Shahenshah Ne Daulat Ka Sahara Leke, Hum Gareebon Ki Mohabbat Ka Udaaya Hai Mazaak” (Ghazal). Time and time again, through various pertinent metaphors, he made us realise our fates were intertwined with each other and “Ye Ishq Ishq Hai” (Barsaat Ki Raat) is the perfect example of how this visionary could articulate similarities and synthesis of cultures and how love alone made us worship stones as incarnations of Gods.
As one re-engages with thousands of Sahir’s verses in his centenary year, it becomes evident that the poet sought equality, justice, peace and prosperity for all. Every genre came easy to him and be it bhajans, sufi songs, ghazals, nazms, love ballads or qawwalis, Sahir embellished each with a thought that was not just vividly different from the rest of his milieu but also immensely lyrical and awe-inspiring.
Though he did write quite a few patriotic songs, he remained a steadfast pacifist who always advocated love and understanding rather than war: “Khoon Apna Ho Ya Paraya Ho, Nasle Aadam Ka Khoon Hai Akhir, Jung Mashirk Mein Ho Ke Magrib Mein, Amne Alam Ka Khoon Hai Aakhir” (Shed the blood of our own or a stranger, It is ultimately the blood of mankind, Be it a war in the east or west, It is ultimately the murder of peace and tranquillity).
As fear and prejudice haunt the lanes of Delhi once again, it would be wise to remember the sane advice of Sahir that war (killing) is itself a problem and can never resolve our problems. ",movies
Mollywood director Sajin Baabu tastes success with ‘Biriyani’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mollywood-director-sajin-baabu-tastes-success-with-biriyani/article30990479.ece,"Film director Sajin Baabu’s elation is evident in his voice. Biriyani, his third film as director, won the Special Jury Award at the 12th Bengaluru International Film Festival 2020 conducted by the Karnataka State Chalachitra Academy, which concluded on March 4. The citation said that it was a “powerful portrayal of the struggles and plight of suppressed women of the society.” Biriyani was among 13 movies screened in the competition section for Indian films. Sajin’s first film Asthamayamvarey had won an award at the same festival in 2015.
Biriyani was premiered in the Asiatic Film festival in Rome and it had won the Netpac award for the best film.
Narrated from a woman’s perspective, Biriyani is about the persecution her family faces when her brother is radicalised and goes missing. Film actor Kani Kusruti plays the lead role of Khadeeja in the film.
In an earlier interview to MetroPlus, Sajin had said: “For a couple of years now, the media has carried reports about youngsters being radicalised and travelling to countries in West Asia to join the Islamic State; some have been arrested, some are missing. I wanted to find out what happens to the families of those men. How have they been treated by neighbours, society, government and community? How have they sustained themselves? The questions haunted me,” says Sajin.
The film director recalls that after the award presentation, he was able to have a chat with the jury members and they congratulated him for his “bold choice to make a film on a theme that is not often discussed”.",movies
Director-writer Sean Anders: ‘It would be fun to see Daniel Day-Lewis do a comedy’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/it-would-be-fun-to-see-daniel-day-lewis-do-a-comedy/article30990456.ece,"Sean Anders, director and screenwriter, is perhaps best known for We’re the Millers, where a ragtag foursome form a family of sorts, Horrible Bosses 1 (in which three friends decide to get rid of their bosses) and 2, Daddy’s Home 1 and 2, Mr Popper’s Penguins and Instant Family, which deals with the subject of adoption. 
With 15 years in the industry, Sean has worked with comedic actors such as Will Ferrell, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudekis, as well as Mark Wahlberg. 
Sean spoke to MetroPlus over the phone about family, recognition for comedies and more. 
 Oh yes, very much. I come from a pretty interesting family (laughs) and I have a pretty wonderful family of my own now. It is the most important part of my life and it always has been and so it just comes out in the writing. 
 Well, we were writing the sequel to the movie. The premise had already been established about having a horrible boss. When my writing partner, John Morris, and I came in to work on the sequel, we wanted to focus on the idea of the little guy being trounced by the 1%, the big, powerful people (laughs). And how these three guys who didn’t have much power at all, might make some bad choices but ultimately stand up to the more powerful character. 







(laughs) Oh no, not at all. I think there is a trade-off with comedy. I think comedy connects better with the average person. Your movies are potentially viewed by a lot more people and appreciated by more people. The downside is that you don’t generally get appreciation from critics or awards. Of course, everyone would love to have appreciation from both sides. But given the choice, I would rather be appreciated by the audience than award shows. 
 Let me put it this way. I think everybody in the industry understands that comedy is difficult. There is that old saying, “Dying is easy, comedy is hard.” I guess it is because comedies are generally not considered terribly important because they don’t always tackle huge, important issues. When people have worked all day, doing the real work of keeping the world moving and they want to come home, unwind and have a laugh, they will got to a theatre and do so. That is where comedy provides something really important. Because dramas and other movies tend to tackle bigger, more important issues, they tend to get more of that critical attention. And maybe rightly so.
No (laughs). I think that this is just the way things work. Joker got recognised because it got into some dark and very interesting territory. Unfortunately, you can’t make a movie like Taxi Driver any more and have it connect with a really large audience the way that movie did. I think Todd Phillips wanted to make his Taxi Driver and I think he knew he had to do it through the medium of superhero movies because that seems to be the only way that a movie can connect to a global audience.







Well, for some reason, right now we’re in an era where superhero movies are just making tons of box office. So, I think it is great that people like Todd Phillips are taking the superhero character in a new and interesting direction and use that to get other points across. It is not just people in capes solving crimes or defeating galactic bad guys. It is a different world right now. We were just laughing the other day that Kramer vs Kramer (1979) was the number one box office hit of the year in America. It just feels like that could never happen again. It just seems like that is now reserved for Marvel and Star Wars.
Oh gosh, yeah (laughs). Daniel Day-Lewis. He is so intensely serious in every film that he does, it would be really fun to see him do a comedy. And I bet he would be hilarious especially if he was playing a guy who was comically serious.
Sean Penn has become an incredibly serious guy. I think he always has been. His Jeff Spicoli (from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) character is still one of my all-time favourite comedic characters anyone has ever played (laughs). I think Meryl Streep is really funny when she does comedy.

"'Gatham', a psychological thriller, made by U.S-based students and IT professionals",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gatham-a-psychological-thriller-made-by-us-based-students-and-it-professionals/article30989839.ece,"A group of U.S-based students and IT professionals — all in their late 20s have made a film titled Gatham and its director Kiran Reddy informs us that they are looking for distributors here. Guntur-born Kiran completed his BTech in Hyderabad and moved to the U.S. where he met like-minded people with whom he formed a team to pursue the passion for films. Completely self taught, the friends made a few short films.
A couple of Kiran Reddy’s short films A Winter To Remember and Where is Ayush? won awards. A short film that he submitted in 2015 fetched him the second best award. He adds, “Directors Harish Shankar and Merlapaka Gandhi who were in the U.S. saw the film and said the content had scope and we could develop it into a full length film and that’s how Gatham took shape. It’s a psychological thriller. A person who forgot his past wakes up from coma and struggles to know about himself. His girlfriend is the only one who has information about him. He wants to meet his parents and they set out on a journey. The car breaks down and this is when a third person offers help. What happens there after is a spine chilling journey, with twists and turns,” says Kiran.






Team behind ‘Gatham’  






In August 2018, the ground work for Gatham started and by December they were done with their pre-production that included finalising the cast, crew and locations. The shoot began during Christmas break as they needed a snow backdrop. Lake Tahoe in California was the centre of action and accurate weather predictions helped them plan their shooting schedules well, says Kiran.
This six-member team want to release it in India and the U.S. They outsourced sound design from Chile. Sri Charan Pakala who scored music for Adivi Sesh’s films like Evaru and Goodachari came on board. Manojh Reddy, DoP of Aswathama and Masthies, a web series by Krish, worked with them. Rakesh who acted in 40 short films in India and Pujita, a student from India star in the film. Pujita happens to be the great-granddaughter of director KV Reddy (Mayabazar).",movies
‘The Batman’ director Matt Reeves reveals first look of new Batmobile from Robert Pattinson’s movie,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-batman-director-matt-reeves-reveals-first-look-of-new-batmobile-from-robert-pattinsons-movie/article30989459.ece,"The Batman director Matt Reeves has once again taken to Twitter to surprise fans by unveiling the first look of the Batmobile from Robert Pattinson’s upcoming new film. 
The movie, which began after Ben Affleck quit the role of the caped superhero, has a planned release date in 2021, and director Reeves continues to excite fans with sneak-peeks at DC’s most popular franchise. 
First, Reeves released a video that offered a glimpse into Pattinson’s Batsuit. Next, images from the shooting were released that offered a better look at the Batman costume as well as the Batcycle. 
Now, new official photos give us a look at the iconic Batmobile, that seems to have undergone quite a few changes from ones seen in earlier Batman movies. Along with the Batmobile, the photos also give abetter look at Pattinson's full costume, including the Batsuit's cape, which was missing in the earlier video that Reeves put out.
Reeves posted three photos on Twitter of Pattinson in full Batman costume standing next to the Batmobile.

"‘Gramavrikshathile Kuyil’ follows the poetic and personal journey of Kumaran Asan, says director KP Kumaran ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kp-kumaran-on-his-movie-about-poet-kumaran-asan-gramavrikshathile-kuyil/article30981669.ece,"Although Kumaran Asan is one of Kerala’s greatest poets, no feature film has been made on his life. KP Kumaran’s Gramavrikshathile Kuyil is the first film on the legendary poet and social reformer. The film, which has KG Jayan and Santhosh Raman behind the camera, sees singer and music composer Sreevalsan J Menon donning the role of Asan. The project that has long been on the mind of the director “took its present shape during the last one year, especially after the socio-political turbulences relating to caste, religious beliefs and rituals that shook Kerala society. Till then, it was kept in abeyance due to reasons like funds, the generation gap that divides the present generation from Asan, and so on. But in the present-day Kerala context, I felt a kind of urgency to talk about this man. I was always fascinated by poetry, especially that of Kumaran Asan and Vyloppilly. But beyond Asan’s scholarship and poetic contributions, it is Asan the individual who enchanted me,” says Kumaran. Excerpts from an interview with the director:
Why Kumaran Asan and why now?
As a person following the socio-cultural and political happenings in Kerala, I am amazed by the way he saw and confronted the world of his times. Asan was born in 1873 and his creative life began at the beginning of the 20th century. It was during the period between 1903 and 1924 that he was most active and rose into prominence. He translated Soundaryalahari, Vivekananda’s Rajayoga, the play Vichitravijayam and so on. He was the editor of Vivekodayam magazine for 15 years and was a member of Praja Sabha and later the Legislative Assembly. He also ran a tile factory. He was close to Sree Narayana Guru and almost became a sanyasin, but opted for married life.
He engaged in all of these while writing some of the greatest poetic works and playing a crucial role in the establishment and development of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), for which he travelled extensively across Travancore, Kochi and Malabar. He was also someone who always lived amidst enemies, especially from his own community. It is all these factors that prompted me to make a film on Asan, despite the hurdles of finance and market.

This is not a conventional biopic in the sense of a chronological account of his life, but depicts his inner life and struggles.
It is impossible to bring in all the aspects of Asan’s life into one film. Moreover, we don’t have enough authoritative and reliable information about his personal life. People know him primarily through his poems and his personality is very much present there, especially in his later poems. It is debatable whether my film is a biopic. I have, however, brought in all the important events in his life: his early education, his encounter with Guru and his life after that, and major events in the last years of his life. A major part of the film is about the last few years of his life. This period is crucial on various counts: firstly, he gets married, which is a turning point in his personal life, and his relationship with Guru. By opting for marriage, Asan ventures into another phase of his life and is on his own, he has neither Guru or the Yogam to fall back upon.
Why the title Gramavrikshathile Kuyil?
I took the title from a poem by Asan, a metaphorical poem about his life, where he is the bird, and the village tree is the Yogam, and the sage is Guru. In this film I use four of his major poems written during this period: Chinthavishtayaya Sita written in 1919, Duravastha, Chandala Bhikshuki and Karuna. These are very important poems; their content is radically political and they are poetic. The film follows the poetic and personal journey of Asan through all these poems.
So, Asan’s poetry constitutes a prominent thread of this film?
To make a film by including all the facets of a personality like Asan and all the people and events he was associated with is either impossible or absurd. A film demands a certain kind of narrative precision and expression through visual and oral elements. When you are portraying a poet through film, his poems should be central. But how do you represent present poetry in film? My focus was on creating evocative visuals that would resonate Asan’s poetry: it could be landscapes, waterfalls, the sea, lakes, paintings... For instance there is a poem titled ‘Garisopa’ where the poet, along with Dr Palpu’s family, journeys to see a waterfall. Here the basic visual elements are the waterfalls and the forest. Likewise there is reference to the sculptures at Ajanta and Ellora, which I have used in the film. So, my attempt was to combine words and images in an evocative manner and thus to find a new narrative and visual synergy, rather than one representing the other ‘faithfully’. Though I had a complete script with me, I had to find evocative visuals to go with it. So I used paintings and sketches, archival footage on Calcutta [Kolkata] city of that period etc.
One major visual motif of the film is water. Was it a conscious choice?
Yes, it was. There is even a specific mention about that in the film, where Asan talks about his lifelong relationship with water. Moreover, the use of water bodies and their shimmering presence in various forms also give the film a certain visual feel and mood. Asan was born near the sea, the name of his native place is ‘Kayikkara’ which is a combination of kayal (backwaters) and kara (land). Later when he joined Guru, the Aruvippuram ashram too was along the Neyyar river. Finally, he met with his death in the waters. In a scene, Asan says, ‘Periyar river looks placid on the surface, but carries many turbulences beneath’. So, water acts not only as a visual motif but also flows as a philosophical and metaphorical undercurrent through the film.
Asan is a poet who taught us to love, for love in various forms and moods are present in Asan poems...
Yes, Asan is a poet of love, who dealt with love in various contexts and expressions. He also used an array of terms like premam, anuragam, sneham, priyam, anpu, pranayam and so on to denote the various shades of love. But in my film, the focus is more on the political and humanitarian issues that Asan’s poetry dealt with.
For instance, he made a frontal attack on caste system much before Ambedkar. There is a scene in my film where Asan ruminates upon his condition while walking along the walls of the Fort in Thiruvananthapuram. He says I am a well-known poet and member of the Praja Sabha, but I am not allowed entry into the Fort, and I quote his poem where he asks how many Perumals, Sankaracharyas, Thunchans and Kunjans will it need to liberate his land from casteism. So my focus is on how Asan used his energies as a poet, social activist and legislator to fight the evil of caste.
In your film there are no well-known actors... most of them come from different backgrounds and are new to cinema. Was it a conscious decision?
I made a conscious choice of casting fresh talents, as I didn’t want any kind of star image to eclipse that of Asan. Luckily Sreevalsan Menon resembles Asan. The heroine of this film is also a fresh face; she has acted only in one film before this. Pramod Raman, television journalist and writer, plays the role of Murkoth Kumaran in the film. So there are familiar faces in the film. I avoided the stars as I wanted Asan to be the central character and the only star in this film.
How do you think this film about a great poet will be received by the contemporary Malayali audience?
Actually we have forgotten Kumaran Asan. I think there is no other Malayali who has contributed so deeply to our culture and politics like Asan. I consider the film a curtain raiser to the rich and complex personality of Kumaran Asan.
Where do you place this film in your oeuvre?
It is a film that gave me great satisfaction. Through this film I intend to address a generation of Malayalis who grew up listening to or reading Asan’s poetry.",movies

"Shane Nigam issue ends as AMMA, KFPA reach an agreement",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shane-nigam-issue-ends-as-amma-kfpa-reach-an-agreement/article30988866.ece,"The long-drawn saga involving actor Shane Nigam was eventually resolved amicably after the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) and the Kerala Film Producers Association (KFPA) reached an agreement settling the issue at a meeting held here on Wednesday. 
Mr. Nigam was asked to complete the two films featuring him in the lead — Veyil and Qurbani, the production of which have been in a limbo since the controversy erupted last year — between March 2 and April 18.
“It was decided that he will not act in any other movie before the completion of these two films. He will, however, be free to commit films,” said M. Ranjith, president, KFPA. 
It was also agreed that Mr. Nigam would pay a compensation to the producers of the two movies for the loss caused by the disruption in production. While AMMA general secretary Edavela Babu chose not to disclose the compensation amount, Mr. Ranjith said the actor would pay ₹16 lakh each to the producers of both films. The compensation would either be paid in cash or would be deducted from the actor’s remuneration. The producers had initially demanded ₹1 crore from the actor and threatened to abandon both the films. 
He said that the actor had already agreed to forgo his demand for an excess ₹15 lakh for completing the dubbing for another movie, Ullasam.
Asked whether the agreement would mark the lifting of the ‘undeclared ban’ on the actor, Mr. Ranjith said there was never a ban but only non-cooperation, which, he said, would no longer be there with the resolution of the issue. 
He further said that producers would hold another meeting with AMMA to discuss ways to resolve various problems faced at the sets of film shoots. Asked about the formulation of any code of conduct for actors, Mr. Ranjith said all such things would be decided after the meeting. 
Mr. Nigam ran into trouble towards the end of last year after he initially made a social media post alleging a death threat from the producer of Veyil. The problem accentuated when the actor shaved off his hair, which threw a spanner in the continuity of the film, following which the film’s producer, Joby George, lodged a complaint with KFPA.
 Since the controversy erupted last October, Mr. Nigam has had only one release — Valiyaperunnal.",movies

‘No Time To Die’ trailer: Daniel Craig dazzles in his swansong as James Bond

Movie theaters have been closed in China since January and other nations, including Japan, South Korea and parts of Italy, are also closing theaters in a bid to stem the spread of the virus.
The Bond franchise is one of the movie worlds most lucrative, with 2015's Spectre raking in $880 million at the box office worldwide, while Skyfall in 2012 grossed more than $1 billion globally.
No Time to Die cost an estimated $200 million to produce and was due to open in movie theaters from April 2 after a world premiere in London on March 31.
The James Bond postponement followed coronavirus disruptions to filming new movies and TV shows and delays in releasing U.S. movies in China.

A planned three-week shoot in Venice, Italy, for Tom Cruise's new Mission: Impossible film was postponed last week due to the outbreak, and producers of the CBS television global competition show The Amazing Race said last week they had temporarily suspended filming of a new season.
James Bond fan sites had also written to the studios behind the film this week, urging for a delay.
“With the coronavirus reaching pandemic status, it is time to put public health above marketing release schedules and the cost of cancelling publicity events,” fan website MI6-HQ.com wrote in an open letter.
“We have all waited over 4 years for this film. Another few months will not damage the quality of the film and only help the box-office for Daniel Craig's final hurrah,” the letter added.
Wednesday's post said the film will now be released in the United Kingdom on November 12 and in the United States on November 25.

COVID-19 | Trade impact for India estimated at $348 million: UN report ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/covid-19-trade-impact-for-india-estimated-at-348-million-un-report/article30987932.ece,"The trade impact of the coronavirus epidemic for India is estimated to be about 348 million dollars and the country figures among the top 15 economies most affected as slowdown of manufacturing in China disrupts world trade, according to a UN report.
Estimates published by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Wednesday said that the slowdown of manufacturing in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting world trade and could result in a $50 billion decrease in exports across global value chains.

The most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment.
Among the most affected economies are the European Union ($15.6 billion), the United States ($5.8 billion), Japan ($5.2 billion), South Korea ($3.8 billion), Taiwan Province of China ($2.6 billion) and Vietnam ($2.3 billion).
India is among the 15 most affected economies due to the COVID-19 epidemic and slowdown in production in China, with a trade impact of $348 million.
The trade impact for India is less as compared to other economies such as EU, the U.S., Japan and South Korea. Trade impact for Indonesia is $312 million.
For India, the trade impact is estimated to be the most for the chemicals sector at 129 million dollars, textiles and apparel at $64 million, automotive sector at $34 million, electrical machinery at $12 million, leather products at $13 million, metals and metal products at $27 million and wood products and furniture at $15 million.
Besides its worrying effects on human life, the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential to significantly slow down not only the Chinese economy but also the global economy. China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations. Any disruption of China’s output is expected to have repercussions elsewhere through regional and global value chains, UNCTAD said.
Over the last month, China has seen a dramatic reduction in its manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) to 37.5, its lowest reading since 2004.
This drop implies a 2% reduction in output on an annual basis. This has come as a direct consequence of the spread of corona virus (COVID-19).
The 2% contraction in China’s output has ripple effects through the global economy and thus far has caused an estimated drop of about $50 billion across countries,”UNCTAD said.
“The most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment,"" it added.
UNCTAD said because China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations, a slowdown in Chinese production has repercussions for any given country depending on how reliant its industries are on Chinese suppliers.
In addition to grave threats to human life, the coronavirus outbreak carries serious risks for the global economy, UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.
Any slowdown in manufacturing in one part of the world will have a ripple effect in economic activity across the globe because of regional and global value chains, he said.
Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTAD’s Division on International Trade and Commodities, said for developing economies that are reliant on selling raw materials, the effects could be felt very intensely.
""Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short-term, it’s likely that the overall impact on the global economy is going to be significant in terms of a negative downturn,"" she said.
The estimated global effects of COVID-19 are subject to change depending on the containment of the virus and or changes in the sources of supply.
Meanwhile, the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19 moved further into focus as UN economists announced a likely $50 billion drop in worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone.
Highlighting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the epidemic, in which there have been more than 90,000 confirmed cases in more than 70 countries (the majority in China) and over 3,000 deaths, Ms. Coke-Hamilton said that U.S. measures in terms of visitor arrivals, cancelling various meetings were having a knock-on effect in terms of demand.
""So right now, we’re not clear on where it will go — a lot will depend on what happens with COVID-19; if they are able to come up with a vaccine then hallelujah, hopefully it will end very quickly, but if not, the impact can be severe,"" she said.",economy

Keeping in mind the many travel restrictions following the outbreak of the coronavirus, and with the hope that the situation would be under control at a later stage, the organisers have proposed to hold the rifle and pistol World Cup from May 5 to 12, and the shotgun events from June 2 to 9.
In a press release, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president Raninder Singh stated that 23 nations, 240 shooters and 114 accompanying officials had withdrawn from the confirmed original list, owing to the situation caused by the virus that has spread to 93 countries.
The NRAI stressed that it was compelled to suggest the postponement, especially owing to the possibility of some of the visiting shooters being kept in quarantine.
The ISSF stated that it was waiting for the approval of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the extension of the Olympic qualification period.
“In case of the IOC approval, the World Cups in Munich and Baku, can also influence the outcome of the Olympic qualification’’, said the ISSF statement, even as it reiterated that all Olympic quota places would be allocated by May 31.
Only the 12 quota places to be decided on world rankings and a possible small number of unused quota places would require reallocation after May.
The ISSF cautioned the members, about the need to be “very careful with air tickets bookings, hotel reservations and other travel expenses due to the uncertainty of the situation in order to avoid possible financial losses.’’",other sports
"Coronavirus impact: Delhi shooting World Cup postponed, Olympic test event cancelled ",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-impact-delhi-shooting-world-cup-postponed-olympic-test-event-cancelled/article31001965.ece," The upcoming combined shooting World Cup in the national capital was on Friday postponed to May, while an Olympic test event in Tokyo stood cancelled due to the global novel Coronavirus outbreak.
 The tournament, sanctioned by the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), was to be held from March 15 to 25 in Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range. The Olympic Test event was scheduled to be held from April 16.
The World Cup will now be held in two parts before the Olympic Games.
“It is proposed to divide the World Cup in two parts and hold Rifle and Pistol competitions on May 5-12, 2020, while Shotgun competitions - on June 2-9, 2020,” the ISSF said in a statement.
 The decision was taken after the tournament organisers National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) approached the ISSF with a proposal to postpone the event.
 The development comes after the government imposed several restrictions on the entry of travellers from affected countries such as China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Iran, in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
 Considering the extraordinary situation, the ISSF has also requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to prolong the internal Olympic qualification period in order to ensure all shooters get equal chances of making it to the Games.
“In case of the IOC approval, the World Cups in Munich, Germany, and Baku, Azerbaijan, can also influence the outcome of the Olympic Qualification,” the ISSF said.
“It must be noted that all Qualification Quota Places, as planned, will be allocated by May 31, 2020,” the sport’s apex body added.
 In all, 22 countries had pulled out of the Delhi event, an official in NRAI had earlier told PTI.
“While 22 was the last count till Thursday night, some counties who had withdrawn, have also reapplied for visas,” he said.
The Indian government’s list of guidelines states that the visa of all foreign nationals, who have visited the affected countries in the year 2020 and have not yet landed in India, will be cancelled.
 The Delhi event was to be a combined World Cup for rifle/pistol and shotgun shooters.
 In the wake of the Coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, many sporting events across the world have been either cancelled or postponed in recent weeks.
 Last week, India pulled out of the ISSF World Cup in Cyprus, citing the coronavirus threat.
 The outbreak has so far claimed more than 3000 lives and infected close to 100,000 people across the world.
 The ISSF had on Wednesday announced that the World Cup in Delhi won’t carry ranking points because athletes from all countries cannot participate following the health advisory issued by the Indian government. ",other sports

How unprocessed trauma is kindling communal violence in South Asia in the 21st century,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-unprocessed-trauma-is-kindling-communal-violence-in-south-asia-in-the-21st-century/article31001469.ece,"Stanford psychiatrist Shaili Jain’s family history is one of trauma and tragedy. Her paternal grandfather was murdered during Partition in 1947. Her father, who was 10 at the time, was forced to flee his home and become a refugee in India, where he worked as a child labourer. 
Two decades later, he would immigrate to England, where Jain was born and raised. “I spent chunks of my youth living in the shadow Partition had cast on his life and with a feeling that no matter how much I loved him, and he loved me, a part of him forever changed in 1947 and remained inaccessible,” she says. 
This lingering trauma, more commonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), influenced her decision to opt for a career in medicine and later specialise in psychiatry. She has always been fascinated by “the connections between thought, emotion and behaviour, in deconstructing emotional suffering and finding ways to alleviate psychological distress” — to the extent that she decided that Partition, which had, all along, been central to her own life and career choices, should be at the heart of her first book, The Unspeakable Mind: Stories of Trauma and Healing from the Frontlines of PTSD Science, released last August.
“Trauma often represents the violation of all we hold to be dear and sacred. Such events are simply too terrible to utter aloud and hence they become unspeakable,” says Jain, explaining the book’s title. “Sometimes the survivor wishes to speak, but the wider community is unwilling or unable to bear witness to their story, so the survivor is forced into silence.”
Science of suffering
The problem is that PTSD thrives in such conditions. 
In her capacity as a trauma scientist, Jain diagnoses the festering sectarian tensions in South Asia as a result of repression, dissociation and denial operating on a societal level. “The science of suffering tells us that there is a big price to pay for such collective denial. Atrocities don’t remain buried forever. As powerful as the desire is to deny, in the long run, it does not work. I feel strongly, that this unprocessed collective trauma has engendered future spirals of communal violence in South Asia, a violence that continues to be re-enacted in the 21st century.”
Today, she is considered to be one of the world’s leading experts on PTSD. Her research and almost two decades of treating thousands of trauma survivors are part of a revolution in understanding and treating the illness. “Traumatic thoughts and memories that remain “unspeakable” or “unthinkable” for too long often impede our brain’s natural process of recovery after trauma,” says Jain. “They become stuck points that inhibit the mental reintegration needed for healing to occur. PTSD mutes happiness and yields, instead, to an irritability that keeps sufferers on the perpetual verge of withdrawal from the world and alienation from those who love them.”
The causes of PTSD are many. Rape, family violence, being mugged, escaping a major accident, being a political or economic refugee are just some examples. Higher rates of PTSD are found in the armed forces, but they are also found in police officers and low-income women and youth who reside in urban ghettos and shanties. PTSD is often found among the depressed, alcohol- and drug-addicted, and the anxiety-ridden. All sufferers are at higher risk of death by suicide, so the collective mental health burden is huge.
Dr. Jain is playing a significant role in informing the world about how widespread the condition is and the urgency of treatment. Indeed, trauma-related disorders, overall, are the largest cause of health problems and disability worldwide, more than cardiovascular diseases and cancer combined. They can also be infectious. Family members of people with the condition are at higher risk of inheriting it themselves. “PTSD seeps beyond the confines of the mind or brain and alters the body’s hormone secretion, neurochemistry and immune system. This contributes to diseased cells, organs, and other bodily systems. It has emerged as a risk factor for many conditions — cancer, heart disease and obesity — to name a few.” 
A ‘Western’ problem
According to a recent World Health Organization-sponsored study, India is the world’s most depressed country, with one of the highest suicide rates in the world. According to the study, a student commits suicide every hour in India and over 2,20,000 people take their own lives every year. Data from the 2015-16 National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) indicates that every sixth person in India needs mental health help of some sort. Despite all this, there is an unsettling resistance — on the part of influential thought leaders — to mental health being a problem in India. There is a belief that it is somehow an American/ Western problem. The average Indian would rather go to a ‘spiritual’ healer than seek professional help for their issues. And the concept of psychotherapy is largely unknown outside of the major metros. 
PTSD has always been endemic to our society, however, it has not always been acknowledged as such. Partly because hidden psychological wounds are harder for people to understand, but also because the socially disadvantaged are most vulnerable to the effects of prolonged exposure to trauma. So, if the victim is from a marginalised or impoverished background, historically, their trauma account might not be validated by wider society.
“When it comes to trauma and PTSD, as a society we must accept how one’s social reality can have a profound influence on one’s mental health and biology,” says Jain. “As an example, if you are raised in a culture where family violence is the norm or perpetrating sexual violence is acceptable, the odds are that will leave an imprint on the way you think and behave, not only on a psychological level but on a cellular level too. Hurt people, hurt people. There is no shame in recognising a need to undo such harm.”
Silence and denial
It is also important to challenge the stigma around mental health in India. People are not likely to open up if disclosing a history of trauma or mental health distress will expose them to prejudice or have a detrimental effect on their professional or personal life. If victim-shaming continues, then the silence and denial surrounding mental health will not go away. Therefore legal and societal protection for victims must be set in stone. Compounding the problem, there is an extreme shortage of qualified mental health professionals — only 10% of the patients having access to treatment, accounting for a negligible 0.06% of India’s healthcare budget. 
The government needs to earmark sufficient funding and set long-term goals for creating a mental health infrastructure, including the training and hiring of professionals and promoting research, development and public awareness. 
“There is no health without mental health, so there would be a very tangible return on such an investment — a healthier, more productive and hopeful population,” says Jain. “Of course, one’s psychological well-being takes a back seat when one does not have food to eat, clothes to wear or a roof to live under. Any public awareness effort will fall flat if poverty, lack of access to education or healthcare are also not addressed.”

"A melange of rituals, festivities, folk art and commerce at the annual Attukal Pongala in Thiruvananthapuram",https://www.thehindu.com/society/capture-the-colours-and-revelry-of-attukal-pongala-festival-in-thiruvananthapuram/article31000916.ece,"
As dusk envelopes the city, the winding roads that lead to Attukal Bhagavathy Temple are lit in rainbow colours. Fairy lights twinkle along the roads and all the way to the temple precincts. Decorative panels of gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon welcome pilgrims, men and women, of all ages, streaming in from every nook and corner of Thiruvananthapuram. Devotionals, announcements and music from the performances going on in the three stages on the premises of the temple mingle with the rhythm of drums, bells and crackers to create a layered soundscape while all around the parking lot the appetising aroma of spicy snacks, fruit juice, ice creams, peanuts and more tempt families to splurge on a variety of eats. 
At this time of the year, all roads lead to the temple for the 10-day festival that reaches a crescendo with the famous Pongala, termed by the Guinness World Record as “the largest annual gathering of women”. The certificate issued by the Guinness World Record says that on March 10, 2009, 2.5 million women participated in the event organised by the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple Trust. 
Prior to the grand finale, the area surrounding the temple resembles a mela. Stalls selling everything from safety pins, hair clips, bangles and bags to footwear, utensils, toys and readymades spring up around the time of the annual festival and do brisk business till night falls as the temple closes only by midnight. Traders from all over India seem to have congregated here to cash in on the festival. If Pratap Kumar Mandal from Jharkhand is your ubiquitous balloon seller, Hanuman and Ramalal, both from Rajasthan, specialise in gaily painted clay figurines of gods and goddesses. “We hail from Rajasthan but now live in Kerala. All these were made here and now we know when and where such major festivals are conducted. We have been coming to Attukal for the last five years. Business reaches a crescendo on the day before the Pongala when many women camp here overnight,” says Hanuman who refuses to divulge his surname.

Many of the itinerant traders selling keychains, bead necklaces, peacock feathers, slings and an assortment of shiny bags and lampshades hail from Tamil Nadu and many of them have come with entire families in tow. Lottery vendors tempt devotees with promises of “bumper prizes”. But, Prasanna Kumari, who has been selling lottery tickets for 15 years, says sales were much better a couple of years ago. “Now, I find it difficult to sell even two books of tickets. Earlier, four to five books used to get sold,” says the resident of Neyyattinkara. 
Then there are traders from Kollam and Pathanamthitta. Muneer S, who has a stall full of earrings, ear studs and hair clips, says he usually follows the calendar of temple festivals and has put up stalls in many of the well-known temple festivals in the neighbourhood. There is even an art exhibition of mural art-inspired works by Prince Thonnakkal and his students that is drawing many spectators. 
In unison“The Corporation has supplied steel plates and tumblers to residential associations and other organisations that supply food and water for the devotees. This is one festival that eliminates barriers of all kinds and city dwellers work as one to ensure that the Pongala is conducted without any hitches. Since we have been doing this for many years now, there is a procedure and coordination is ensured by all the departments involved in the conduct of the festival. The Chief Minister, Ministers in charge of different portfolios, officials of Kerala State Electricity Board, Kerala Water Authority, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, the Mayor, and senior police officers are some of those involved in the planning for the smooth conduct of the festival. After the festival, it is our sanitation workers who move in to clean the streets in record time,” explains Deputy Mayor Rakhi Ravikumar. 
And while there are many stalls selling earthen ware and steel utensils, what is conspicuous by its absence is plastic. Not a single stall near the temple has plastic containers of any kind. The efficacy of the Green Protocol, which bans use of one-time plastics, is evident in almost all the stalls. 
The temple Trust has made ample provision for supply of drinking water and even devotees standing in queues for darshan of the deity are given boiled water in steel tumblers by an army of volunteers. 
Meanwhile, cultural programmes at the three temporary stages on the temple premises, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika, include different kinds of dance forms, music, Kathakali, Ottanthullal and so on. While the recitals by leading performers are mostly organised by the Temple trust, many dance schools and performers themselves consider it as an offering to the deity. For instance, Nadia S has come with her 12-year-old daughter Lekha Mahesh as her dance school, Kollam-based Sowparnika Dance School, has a slot during the fete for a Bharatnatyam recital. Aaditya R Praveen has just finished her performance and is all set to go home while several youngsters, all made up and dressed, await their chance as fond parents, mobile phones in hand, push and jostle to find a suitable place to record their wards’ recitals.

By around 8 pm, loud beats of the chenda announce the arrival of the elaborately decorated ‘Vilakkukettu kazhcha’ from suburbs like Vellayani, Pappanamcode, Balaramapuram and so on. Balanced precariously on the heads of devotees, the tall pyramidal structures used to be made of tender coconut leaves and plantain stems and adorned with flower garlands. Now, it is more of colourful, glittering paper but the fervour remains the same. Once the last rituals for the day get over at the temple by midnight, the men bearing the vilakkukettu circumbulate the temple accompanied by devotees. “It is quite something to see the way they balance it on their head. Devotees stay on to watch this and by 1 am the temple closes its doors only to reopen the next day at 5 am,” says V Shobha, a member of the Trust in charge of public relations this year. 
Every day, from 10.30 am, a sumptuous lunch is served at the two auditoriums. “About 8,000 devotees have lunch every day during the festival and the number goes up on the day of the Pongala. We cook about 800 sacks of rice. This is in addition to a mess for officers-on-duty at the temple,” explains Shobha. 
This year, the Attukal Pongala falls on March 9.",society
"Meet homemaker-cum-trucker K Sellammal, who is raring to go places ",https://www.thehindu.com/society/have-licence-will-drive/article31001453.ece,"K Sellammal arrives in her Tata Sumo for her interview. As the only woman in her village with a commercial driver’s licence, and her own vehicle, the homemaker from Pachai Veli, Thirupanjali in Manachanallur Taluk, stands out from the crowd easily.
“Most of the women in my village are homebound; they would rather starve than step out of their comfort zone to earn a living. I took up driving in 2018 because I felt it would help me to supplement my husband’s income, and I loved vehicles,” says the 29-year-old mother of two children.
Guided by Women Entrepreneurs Association of Tamil Nadu (WEAT) in Tiruchi, Sellammal attended courses that put her on the road to becoming a professional driver.
Despite being licensed to drive two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, cars and heavy vehicles, she was unable to find employment, mainly because of the bias against women workers.
The Sumo was a gamble Sellammal and her lorry driver husband A Kumaran took last year. With the four-wheel drive, Sellammal had hoped to become the first woman transport provider for a private school in Pachai Veli. “But I was asked to stay away on the very first day because the male drivers there didn’t want to work with me. I was devastated,” she remembers.
Worse, the couple was left burdened with a vehicle loan.
Unfazed, Sellammal decided to get licensed in heavy transport vehicle (HTV) driving by enrolling in a 45-day course at the Ashok Leyland Driver Training Institute in Namakkal in July 2019. She was the only woman in her class of 84 learners.
Sellammal’s multiple licences have brought her both bouquets and brickbats, but she tends to ignore her critics and focuses on the people who have helped her along the way.
“My husband is my biggest champion. When the men in our village laughed at me for daring to drive, and some even suggested I should get a sound thrashing, he would ask me to stay calm and keep at my lessons. His support has brought me this far.”

From September last year, Sellammal has become her husband’s co-driver on the Ashok Leyland Boss BS4 6-wheeler intermediate truck (8 to 14 tonnes capacity) that he plies for a private transporter based out of Tiruchengode.
“Driving school isn’t enough for professional truckers, we have to learn how to deal with traffic on the roads,” says Sellammal. “My first trip, from Cuddalore to Kuttipuram in Kerala (nine hours by road) with my husband guiding me, was a bit nerve-wracking. But after that, it got easier, and now I can navigate any route alone confidently. I have driven on different terrains from Chennai, Arcot to Pollachi, taking produce like plantains, beetroots and tender coconuts to Kerala from Udumalapettai, and travelled on through Senkottai and Tirunelveli back home,” she says. 
While truck drivers aren’t expected to offload their cargo, they do have to be extra careful when the vehicle is getting ready for a trip, says Sellammal. “There are some routes which aren’t considered safe for loads of food items like rice, so we have to keep checking to see that the stock doesn’t get stolen in transit,” she says.
Even though there are days when she gets only 45 minutes of sleep, when on the road, Sellammal says that she can easily manage up to 200 kilometers in a day at a moderate speed. “If you drive within the speed limit, and stay alert, there’s nothing to fear,” she says.
Like most truck drivers, Sellammal is paid 15 paise per ₹100 that a transport deal earns. “After the restrictions placed on sand-mining in the Cauvery delta, truck drivers’ earnings have gone down drastically,” she says. “And even though the material and fuel costs have increased, this doesn’t reflect on our income.”
A typical round-trip delivery run can bring in around ₹4000-8000 for the lorry driver in southern India. “Going on a long trip can help the drivers earn more,” says Sellammal, whose husband has gone to Gujarat when we speak. “But it can take a toll on the driver’s health.”
 Though she is happy to help her husband, Sellammal feels becoming a bus driver would be more practical for her, as her two sons need her attention at home. “I am quite willing to work as part of a school team in Pachai Veli, until the kids complete their education. A few families have approached me to chauffeur their women family members on trips to the temples nearby in our Sumo, so that’s another option I am looking at,” she says.
The vehicle may vary, but Sellammal is sure to be in the driving seat for many years to come. ",society

Anitha S, the Branch Manager of State Bank of India in K Pudur, heads a team of half-a-dozen women. What’s new, you ask? This team makes the only all-women branch office of SBI in not only Madurai, but whole of Tamil Nadu.
However, Anitha, who came on transfer from Chennai in May last year, calls it a coincidence. “Now that it has happened, I take small measures to make our work atmosphere and style different,” she says. And, under her, the branch has registered a growth of ₹14 crores. She says that business is growing through word-of-mouth as much depends on how customers are treated by the staff.
As soon as she took over, Anitha worked on the bank’s interiors; she tweaked colour combinations, panel designs, and the lay-out. But she gives most of the credit to her team members, who have been with the branch for the last three to five years.







Manager (Operations) P K Pathmaavathi, Cash officer Suganthi S, Associates Banurekha S and Thouheedha Banu N S who function as single window operators, the Business Development Manager Asreen Riya Fathima and supporting staff V Pillammai — they all support and step in for each other. “In times of domestic emergency or crisis, we are able to approach our boss without any fears,” says Thouheedha.
Anitha says her doors are always open for complaints and suggestions. But she does have her share of difficult customers. “Some people, it they are not satisfied with the response at the first point of query, choose to take up the complaint with the head office instead of approaching the Branch Manager,” says Pathmaavathi. “I have been bluntly told that I am incapable of solving problems because I’m a woman,” adds Anitha.
Strangely, the branch has not been assigned a security guard and the women have pepper spray for self-defence. The team at Pudur police station, and the SP, are just a shout away, if the need arises. 
The women breeze through tasks typically assigned to men in other branches, such as downing the heavy shutters every evening after the office closes and opening it the next morning, buying diesel for the generator and switching it on in case of power cuts, and loading cash in the ATM. 
Women on track
S Anitha, the only woman Senior Assistant Loco Pilot in Madurai Division of Southern Railways, is on her way to becoming the first woman loco pilot too. She has cleared the exam and trained in passenger trains through night shifts, and her promotion letter is due any time. Ask her whom she credits her success to, and without batting an eyelid, she says “my children”. 
She can never forget the many night shifts when she’s had to stay away from them. “Every mother will suffer anxiety. I try to maintain my composure. There have been days when I came back home to a child down with fever,” she says. And after her shift, Anitha herself might not be able to get some rest immediately, despite having to start for her night shift the same day. “Situations become challenging, but I never sulk,” she says.
S Thenmouli joined as a Trackwoman on compassionate grounds after her husband passed away 15 years ago. Her job was to dig out track ballast daily and walk kilometres to the nearest railway station carrying loads of crushed stones. “It was not easy but I had to earn money,” she says. Now promoted to Gate keeper at Ramanathapuram crossing gate from 8 pm to 10 am, she says she sometimes faces troubles from miscreants loafing around in the nights.
A major problem railway women on field face is lack of toilets. “ We do the full shift, even if we are not able to relieve ourselves,” says Anitha.
Railway Protection Force Constable Chinchu Shekhar says while her job is to ensure safety of passengers and protect railway property, sometimes, certain situations unnerve her. Like a recent suicide attempt by a woman at Madurai Railway Station. “I spotted her sitting in a corner of the platform and she was looking strange. She had poisoned herself and her two-year-old child; I immediately rushed them to the hospital. While the child survived and was united with the rest of the family, the mother died. The incident still haunts me,” says Chinchu. The Senior Divisional Manager R P Rathipriya, to whom the women employees report their difficulties, says there is no gender discrimination when a job is assigned. “It is often the mental make-up of colleagues that creates invisible and impenetrable barriers between men and women and fails to remove obstacles,” she says.
Currently undergoing training, the to-be-appointed Station Master Panchami Vasudevan points out that implicit biases do not stop women from joining the workforce. 
Compassion first
 Around 600 policewomen can reach out to T Lilly Grace, the only woman Assistant Commissioner of Police in Madurai City in times of distress. She has recently been appointed the chairperson of Internal Complaints Cell. 







Although she has not received many complaints about harassment at workplace, she says that most women find the confidence to pour their hearts out to her regarding their family and personal problems.
Her informal interactions with women police personnel on their morning and night beats often reveal high stress levels. 
“A majority of them complain about lack of enough leaves, missing out on family functions, fatigue from being on duty 24 X 7 without holidays,” says Lilly, who also takes the two dozen women who come directly under her in Anna Nagar where she is posted, on outings once in two or three months. 
We bump into her team one night at the Walker’s Club. It is 9 pm and they all sit together cracking jokes. Now is when they get some free time to share a few laughs over a meal or some ice-cream. “A healthy and friendly dialogue is important and empathy is a tool for their empowerment too,” says Lilly.
It is in moments like these that they reflect on the challenging nature of their work and the multiple flaws in the system. 
“An informal meeting is an opportunity to uninhibitedly thank and commend each other,” says Lilly. She believes that police women choose compassion as a tool to promote safety and justice among the public.
And incidentally, for the first time, she informs us, the city’s women police force would be celebrating International Women’s Day this year.
“We have planned cultural programmes, talent, and entertainment shows,” beams Lilly.",society

The eternal relevance of Michael Scott from 'The Office',https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-eternal-relevance-of-michael-scott-from-the-office/article31003066.ece,"In my teens, the medical sitcom Scrubs had convinced me that the easiest way to make friends was by becoming a young doctor. In my head I was J.D. (Zach Braff), a cool narrator-protagonist who turned hospitals into a hoot. In my early twenties, How I Met Your Mother felt like a natural extension. Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor), the Manhattan-based architect who constructed his emotional core from a series of hopeful heartbreaks, was my spirit animal. But then came my late twenties. And with it, the social media boom – and the crippling epiphany that public validation is a heady drug. 

 Everyone who grew up wanting to emulate a Ted, Raymond, Frasier, Phoebe or Rachel now had the power to be those characters for a live audience. I could choose an identity, curate my image and edit out the vacuum to broadcast a life at odds with my awkwardly introversive personality. Perhaps it’s no surprise that I then took to The Office, a workspace mockumentary centered on a boss who is essentially the human manifestation – and bittersweet critique – of today’s digital culture. In many ways, Steve Carell plays Michael Scott as a social media tragic: A person so obsessed with putting on a show for strangers that his performative personality ends up revealing his inherent loneliness and tone-deaf ignorance. Our undying affection for the so-sad-he’s-good regional manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company’s Scranton Branch stems from the uncomfortable truth that Michael Scott became our spirit animal while we were busy making other plans. 
Michael was a good salesman because he viewed every client as a potential friend whom he sold his image to. Most of us project an inflated version of ourselves online, but the second we sign out – the second Michael reaches home after work – there’s a void that no camera is advanced enough to examine. The bedroom looks empty, the dinner cold and the stillness, punctuated by the clinking of cutlery. All we can do is think of the hits our casual-yet-elaborately-composed Insta stories might garner the next day, or the tasteless prank that might provoke Toby without pissing him off. And then wait, till the sun rises so that the lens can make us feel seen again. 
Michael Scott is emblematic of a generation that manufactures voices to drown out the silence in their heads. But he is so spectacularly bad at it that almost every self-loathing adult – beneath a cult-like reverence for Carell’s role – subconsciously views Michael Scott’s counterfeited extroversion as a cautionary tale. He is the worst-case scenario for the modern introvert. For instance, I routinely panic before entering a room full of people. I rehearse my greetings and expressions. Then I imagine what Michael would do. He’d burst in, accidentally offend everyone and overcompensate for his desolate weekends by being the centre of attention – and the butt of all jokes without even knowing it. So I do the opposite: I abstain from eye contact, stand in a corner and whip out my cellphone to declare how allergic I am to human beings. In doing so, it escapes me that I become the Michael Scott of my own little universe: the centre of attention without even knowing it. Only, my camera captures me avoiding the gaze of other cameras. 

 The most memorable scenes of The Office unfurl when Michael Scott stops trying to make them memorable. Take the episode where none of Pam’s colleagues attend her art exhibition, but Michael barges in before closing time. He rushed to get there, even sincerely appreciating her amateur work, moving Pam to tears with his unassuming gesture. Or Michael’s last day, where Pam rushes to the airport to give him a final hug before he boards the plane. Their goodbye is private; neither know that the cameras are still rolling. Or even the time Michael testifies against his own volatile girlfriend, Jan, in her lawsuit deposition against Dunder Mifflin. These are rare moments in which Michael Scott isn’t performing – because none of them happen in the office. They happen when he unwittingly affects, and becomes a part of, others’ timelines. He doesn’t recognize his own virtues because validation for Michael – he of the friendless childhood and broken family – is something that has to be actively earned rather than passively evoked. 
Recently, after a Twitter spat, I left the house to get some fresh air. An hour later, I received a phone call from an old friend. Stuck in traffic, he spotted me playing with stray dogs down the road. It made him smile and make that elusive phone call. But we didn’t meet after that. He went back home. I went back online. Blissfully unaware that other plans are what happen to us while we’re busy making a spectacle out of life. Deep inside, it’s a slippery feeling. But in the words of Michael Scott: That’s what she said.",movies
‘Onward’ movie review: Pixar's latest advocates for the everyday magic within us ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/onward-movie-review-pixars-latest-advocates-for-the-everyday-magic-within-us/article31002708.ece,"Pixar films can change the way you see the world. Whether it is the symbiosis of art and critique, the afterlife and familial bonding, starting afresh in your twilight years, or humanising emotions ⁠— Pixar has a knack for dismantling perceptions. The imagination, at a conceptual and philosophical level, often transcends the creativity we see on-screen.
OnwardDirector: Dan ScanlonCast: Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Octavia SpencerStoryline: Two elf brothers set off an adventure trip to bring back their deceased father for a day
Pixar’s latest, Onward, has a similar goal —  it wants you to re-imagine family and advocates for everyday magic. But in this one, the audio-visual creativity on-screen supersedes the messaging, which is simple and personal, but hardly life-altering.
The film, which had its world premiere at the Berlinale 2020, begins in a time, long long ago, when there was magic in this world. All mythical creatures knew how to use magic, be free and explore. Over time, the magic started dying and civilisation, as we know it, tamed the creatures. This is the background of Onward, which follows the quest of two elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, to find a jewel that can bring back their dead father. The film functions on two levels, one where the mythical creatures, living in a suburban area, learn to tap into the magic they forgot they had, and other is a more personal one — the pursuit of an absentee father. While the film earnestly and successfully builds up the emotional crescendo with the two brothers, the attempt to reinvigorate magic in a suburban life (allegorically, the world we inhabit today) remains a rather neglected by-product. Onward's philosophy remains on the surface, and even predictable, which is not the level of emotional intelligence we expect from Pixar.
Once you make peace with the disappointment that this Pixar film doesn’t possess the transcendence of Ratatouille, Up or Inside Out, you can enjoy the temporality of the film: the world-building and wit. There are imaginative booby traps, invisible trust bridges, amusing spells and ample silly animation humour. An elf single mother dating a cop centaur, rough pixies riding bikes in groups and a tame manticore running what should have been a dangerous tavern, make for hilarious characters. There’s also a cyclopes police officer, who is touted to be Disney’s first-ever openly-lesbian cartoon character. She has one line that reveals her sexual orientation: “My girlfriend’s daughter got me pulling my hair out.” Even though Russia reportedly has censored ‘girlfriend’ to ‘partner’, the one line isn’t worthy of being glorified as representation in 2020. Its inadequacy and inconsequentiality make it seem more of a publicity bait than genuine inclusion.",movies
‘Kaamyaab’ movie review: A nostalgic trip carelessly executed,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kaamyaab-movie-review-a-nostalgic-trip-carelessly-executed/article31002548.ece,"Birbal, Lilliput, Manmauji, Veeju Khote. All together at a bar, sharing a drink. That one shot is the entire raison d'être of Kaamyaab written all over it – not to talk of the sheer nostalgia that it is soaked in – in a casual, throwaway manner. Hardik Mehta’s ode to the side-actor of the 70s-80s-90s cinema kicks off well. There’s the nicely observed, cloyingly sweet TV interview of “Garhwal ki prerna” (the inspiration of Garhwal), side actor Sudheer (Sanjay Mishra), who has retired into anonymity while people still remember him for his on-screen takiya kalaam (catch-phrase): “Enjoying life. What’s the option?”

That tiny, barely recognisable face on the corner of the poster, the quintessential aloo (potato) that could adapt well with any vegetable, Kaamyaab gives little nods to them, their versatility as against the swagger of the digital generation, the intimacy and grace in the relationship of old-timers and stacked against it is the rant of the newer lot--purane chawal se risotto kaise banayein (how to cook risotto with rice that has aged well)?
Old-time Bollywood actor Sudheer (Sanjay Mishra) decides to come out of retirement to do a role for achieving the record figure of 500 films. Will he, won’t he?
There is something simple, sincere and well-intentioned at the heart of Kaamyaab but it is also quick to get mired in similar pigeonholes that the unheralded actors found themselves trapped in; lifelong. A lot of them still do. There is a familiarity to the arc, predictability in telling and expectedness about the gags as well as the characters, whether it’s the big hero with a huge ego, the sly casting director, the competitive character actor, the struggling young actor neighbour or the grumbling, disapproving daughter; or the odd wig or the kitschy clothes or that 30ml whiskey. What’s more a seasoned Sanjay Mishra doesn’t seem invested in the character.
The finale, ingeniously juxtaposes the idea of relatability of a small star as against glamour of the bigger entity, the affection elicited by one as opposed to the huge fandom of the other and meshes it all with the idea of “success”, how one dwarfs the other and both, perhaps, are as hollow. Unfortunately, you can only read the subtext between the lines; it refuses to fly on screen. Kaamyaab stays precariously hung between a great idea and lackadaisical execution.",movies

Climate Change: The Facts, the new show on Sony BBC Earth, like the title proclaims, presents the facts about climate change. That the said facts are presented by David Attenborough who says “We are running out of time, but there is still hope,” makes it more palatable. 
In an hour, we learn all we need to know about climate change and what each of us can do to stall and reverse the process. For instance, while I have heard about carbon emissions and carbon footprints, when the programme likened carbon to a blanket surrounding the earth and increased emissions thanks to fossil fuels, which power our lives, resulting increased temperatures, it made perfect sense. More emissions means thicker blanket means more heat — it is that simple.
When we hear of temperatures increasing by one degree since pre-industrial days, it does not sound like much. But a single degree can result in rising seas, floods, typhoons forest fires and other forms of extreme weather as seen in the forest fires of Australia and the deluge in Kerala. The description of a father and son who drove through a wild fire in the US with trees exploding was apocalyptic.
Climate Change: The FactsPresenter: David AttenboroughDirector: Serena DavisRun time: 60 minutesEpisodes: 1
Scientists believe 8 per cent of species are going to go extinct because of climate change. The heat has caused a third of the corals to bleach and die. Ice frozen for millennia is melting and causing sea levels to rise. Louisiana is losing land the fastest on the planet at the rate of a football field every 45 minutes!
Incidentally scientists warned about global warming in 1988, but fossil fuel companies used the same tactics as tobacco companies to obfuscate the facts. Remember ad agencies trying to put a positive spin on smoking in Mad Men?
After all the horrors, comes the hope in the form of Greta Thunberg, the Swedish school girl who went on strike to protest climate change, the Paris Agreement, and the simple lifestyle changes we can make to heal the planet.
A ready reckoner on what ails the planet and what can be done presented by David Attenborough makes for compelling viewing.

Alphons Joseph hits the right note with the Dulquer Salmaan-starrer ‘Varane Avashyamund’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/varane-avashyamund-has-been-a-good-break-says-music-director-alphons-joseph/article31001325.ece,"Music director Alphons Joseph sounds happy over the phone. He has good reason to be — his songs for Varane Avashyamund are doing well, as is the film. “It is always a good feeling when the film and the songs both do well. One wouldn’t like to hear that the songs are doing well but not the film,” he says. Anoop Sathyan’s film is his first for the year, last year he had composed for Lonappante Mamoodeesa.
Of late he has not been composing back to back for films. Music has kept him busy, he says, only that they had nothing to do with films. He has completed his post-graduation in Carnatic music; he has been working on developing the syllabus for his music school, Crossroads, as well as for pre-school music education and of course, live stage shows. “There was a gap for three to four years, but it has all to do with music.”
Working with Sathyan Anthikkad was a long cherished dream and getting to work with his son, Anoop, came close. An acquaintance told Alphons that Anoop was interested in him composing music for the film and connected the two. “The story was such that it had scope for music, especially since it is located in Chennai and give a feel of Tamil culture. I was able to put to use what I learnt for my PG.” The film gave him my an opportunity to try vastly different things like the song ‘Ne Va En Aarumukha...’ and the hip hop number ‘Unnikrishnan’s song’.

10 Years of ‘Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya’: Breaking down the greatness of ‘Aaromale’ in words

10 years of Aaromale...The filming of Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya was done when, Alphons says, the music director AR Rahman (ARR) felt he wanted to add one more song. That song was Aaromale..., which Alphons believes was God’s gift to him, facilitating his ‘second coming’ to the industry. It went on to become one of the most popular songs of the film. “It still is. Each time I am part of an ARR show this song is played and what a response it gets each time!” The song was to be used as promotional, instead it went into the film thanks to some readjustments by director Gautham Menon. “I firmly it happened for me. Also it was the first time that Rahman sir had created a song like that, with a bluesy feel to it.”Alphons had been going through a tough time personally as he had been diagnosed with spondylosis and was confined to the bed. He had been able to compose only one song for Casanova. He was pursuing his masters (first year) in Carnatic music from the Calicut University when he got the call from Rahman’s office. “Being confined to the bed, it was a time for deep introspection for me. I had been thinking a lot about life and spirituality. God intervened, when I got that call.”Alphons had met ARR in 2002, when he attended the audio launch of Alphons’ debut film Vellithira. Alphons had a sung a song at the function, which led ARR to ask, “whether I wanted to be a composer or sing. I told him I wanted to compose, but if I got a good break I wouldn’t mind giving singing a shot. Perhaps Rahman sir remembered that.” He credits Rahman for allowing him to improvise with the song for stage shows, like recently at a Rahman show where he performed with a saxophonist.
“Anoop asked if we should take a krithi (for ‘Ne Va En Aarumukha...’) or create a new song from scratch. I told him let’s write a song, we got Dr. Kritaya to write the Tamil part and lyricist Santhosh Varma the Malayalam part which I then set to tune. It went very well with the film’s Navarathri scene. All the songs worked organically with the plot, the songs gelled with the situations.” Another song, ‘Muthunne Kannukalil...’, has a story as well. Shobhana wasn’t very keen to dance for the song, as she wasn’t sure if it would be relevant. “We wanted the song to be such that she would agree...after listening to the song she did.”
The music for the song was a collaborative effort. Alphons, Anoop and Santhosh Varma worked together on the project in Chennai except the ‘Mullapoove...’ song which was composed almost immediately after Alphons heard the story. “Working together was good, we complemented each other. The last time I worked like this was for Vellithira and Jalolsavam. Anoop was very open to suggestions. What makes me most happy is that everything that was composed for the film was used.” The feedback he has got from others in the industry has been good, especially that he has tried different genres — classical, hip-hop, melody, and Christian devotional — for the film.
Alphons has also sung for the film — ‘Oh! En Eesa...’ and ‘Mathi Kann Ullathu Chollan...’ What makes him most happy about the project is that he got playback singer KS Chithra to sing for him after a while. “It has been a while and it was so good to work with Chithra chechi, the last time was Jalolsavam.” His next project is Bhadran’s Joothan which he says has also given him a chance to try varied kinds of music.",movies
‘Les Misérables’ questions the responsibility of the government towards its people: Alexis Manenti ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/les-misrables-questions-the-responsibility-of-the-government-towards-its-people-alexis-manenti/article31001177.ece,"After making waves in the festival circuit, Ladj Ly’s hard-hitting political drama “Les Misérables” is releasing in India. As part of the promotions, Alexis Manenti (co-screenwriter and one of the main protagonists) and actor Omar Soumare were in Delhi, recently. 
The first thing that strikes about the French film is its title, inspired by Victor Hugo’s classic novel. “The film’s major connection to the Victor Hugo novel is that it is set in Montfermeil, a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, where an important part of the classic novel is set. So even after 150 years the place stills suffers from poverty,” reveals Manenti. 
Soumare agrees that the title does create a sense of curiosity among the audiences owing to obvious reasons. 
“The people want to find out if it’s a modern retelling of the same story or not. So, the title does help at some level. But I think that ultimately the success of the movie is because of what it offers not because of its title,” asserts Soumare who feels that the film’s greatest strength is that it doesn’t take position for the police or for the population. 
“It shows that police is also the victim of the political situation. Also, the policemen are underpaid but they try to do their job. But the social tensions and political pressures are so intense that it becomes very hard for them,” adds Soumare. 
 
While, Hugo’s novel offered a critique of a French society essentially comprising French people, Ladj Ly’s examines the plight of the immigrant population in Montfermeil. “What has changed is that earlier there were all French people but now the place has a lot of immigrants, especially of African or Arabic ethnicities. But, the problems they face are more or less the same. So, the film talks about poverty and the present situation. What makes the situation worse is the violence, and cops provoking people. As a result there are riots against the police towards the end of the film,” reveals Manenti while lamenting about the loss of life and property in the recent Delhi riots about which he got to read in the newspapers. 
“Les Misérables” is actually based on a short film of the same name made by Ladj Ly about three years back. “The director Ladj Ly is a friend of mine. We started 20 years ago doing some short films. Now, around three years back he asked me to write a short film with him. He also offered me a part in it. Since the short film tasted a lot of success at the festival circuit, a producer came on board and asked us to make a feature film on the short one. So that’s when we started to expand the screenplay. It took us six months to write it. It has the same basic story with same central characters but the end is not the same,” explains Manenti who won the award for Best Male Newcomer for the film at the recent César Awards. 
 
Manenti, who plays a cop in the film, trained with real cops to prepare for his part. “My character Chris is a bad cop. He is violent, arrogant, racist and corrupt. I let Ladj write scenes for me which added an element of surprise to Chris. Also, on the sets, I was just the actor and let Ladj take care of the briefing and other tasks. It allowed me to focus entirely on my acting. I watched a lot of movies about cops. Also, I had some training with the cops in order to understand how they walk, how they work, and the words they use, their methods, technicalities and procedures involved,” reveals Manenti.
Soumare’s preparation, on the other hand, was pretty straight forward. “I play a character called Macha who works for the street mayor from the suburb. He is not the real mayor and uses street kids for all kinds of shady activities. He is half-gangster, half-leader . My character is basically his right-hand man. Although, I don’t have many scenes with Chris in the movie, there is an inherent dislike between the two of our characters. My preparation was simple. I just stuck to the basics,” recounts Soumare. 
Manenti opines that the film’s highly political nature and hard-hitting subject made it less appealing to the Oscar jury in comparison to some of its competitors. “Our film is not afraid to highlight the tension between the police and the migrant population. Also, it questions the responsibility of the government towards its people. Maybe, the Academy preferred ‘Parasite’ because though it also talks about poverty, it is not as political as ‘Les Miserables’. Also, perhaps, it’s a part of success of ‘Parasite’ that it’s not so realistic,” sums up Manenti. ",movies
Sanjay Mishra: Story of a sidekick,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sanjay-mishra-story-of-a-sidekick/article31001154.ece,"In the last decade, there has been a rise of faith in supporting actors in Hindi films. One of them is Sanjay Mishra. Now, Mishra’s fame as a supporting actor has made him the subject of Kaamyaab, which closely relives what he has experienced in the film industry. With Shah Rukh Khan presenting the film, it seems Kaamyaab has a successful promotion strategy. 
He nods, “Involvement of a name like Shah Rukh Khan has brought a different kind of attention to this small film. Otherwise, it is still difficult to find space for such films. You cannot imagine me to be a hero who could attract the audience, but I am feeling like a hero right now. That is because of the compelling story which made me the centre of attraction,” he says. 
Kaamyaab is Hardik Mehta’s debut film which centres around a character actor Sudhir’s yearning to complete 500 films. Mishra relates his own experiences of the famous Juhu Tara road where he used to roam around to find a role in films. “That was the reason I picked up this film as I had to play the struggle of an actor and that is the world I know inside out. I was Hardik’s choice because I have lived that life. Like Sudhir, I did a lot of films where I had a very small screen time. However, I am different from Sudhir in terms of his approach towards his career as unlike him I never came here to become a typical hero.”
Mishra reminds there was a time when actors were earmarked for a particular role. “For drunkard, you had Keshto Mukherjee. For father, there was Kader Khan, for judge, D.K.Sapru and for corrupt bureaucrat there was Om Shiv Puri. It is a homage to these wonderful actors as well,” he underlines.
One should admire Mishra for rising above the sidekick tag to play meaty roles in films such as Aankhon Dekhi, Masaan, and Kadvi Hava. “The process of filmmaking should be an exploration. Director explores the actor and actor get a chance to explore himself while understanding the director’s choices. I love to be directed by new directors and films like Masaan, Newton and Angrezi Mein Kahte Hain were a result of that exploration only,” he reveals. “I am glad that these films are giving me a chance to act as a protagonist and that is different from my other films where I play supporting roles and the responsibility to carry the film is not on my shoulders.” 
Hindi films are increasingly telling ordinary people’s stories and, in a way, has created a demand for actors who could essay such characters. Mishra is aware of this trend. “A film like Masaan talks about the sensibilities of youth but that was not a college romance. There was a time when there existed a parallel cinema, but those stories are now becoming mainstream. 
Had they been made in the ‘80s, they would have been treated as a parallel cinema but right now it is not a case. There is a space for older actors, heroines are not just hero's love interest and I am very thankful for this change.” Is there an increased affinity of the audience for older characters as well? “Of course, you can see how Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan has re-invented himself. There was a time when old age was considered as something negative on screen. I feel, if you show gripping old characters to the audience, they will be inspired.” 
Initially, he was chosen for roles close to his real self, but gradually filmmakers realised his range. He likes picking up mannerisms from different spaces and cultural humour which helps him become a new person in every film. “I learnt music in my childhood and I relate that with the acting I do. You need to understand the note of the character and that should be tuned to the director’s vision.”
Mishra says he is content. “If you get success very early, it becomes essential that you maintain it. It becomes difficult and there comes a lot of pressure. As I got the attention very late, I don’t have any ego.”",movies

An adaptation of Unni R’s popular short story by the same name, the film zooms in on Razia, a young woman, and her desire to recite the Azaan (the call to prayer), better known as vaanku in Malayalam, to the shock of her family and society.

The daughter of filmmaker VK Prakash, Kavya says she grew up watching her father work on various sets, be it commercials, music videos or films. “And I knew then, even as a child, that I wanted to become a director. I am fascinated by each and every aspect of direction. I enjoy the entire process right from scripting and casting to shooting and editing. I have been hands on on all aspects of Vaanku, even the music composition and the final mix of the film,” says Kavya, a graduate of visual communication from Manipal University.
The seed for shooting Vaanku as her directorial first was planted by Unni. “Unni sir had dropped by my father’s office and we began talking. He started narrating various stories of his. I felt an instant connect when I heard Vaanku. He noticed how my eyes lit up when he narrated the tale and suggested I turn it into a film. As I was fascinated by the tale and its characters I didn’t think twice.”
The scripting for the movie took over two years as Shabna Muhammed, who has penned the screenplay and dialogues, wanted to handle “the sensitive subject subtly without hurting anyone’s sentiments or sensibilities. Razia’s desire to recite vaanku is not an act of rebellion or a means for her to challenge the community; it comes from her desire to bring out her Sufi nature.
“We have given close attention to detail to the dialogues, the clothes, the village wherein the film was set…”
It also helped that Unni was personally involved with the project from start till end. “I was clear that I wouldn’t tamper with his vision. He was there as a guide at every step of the making of the film.”

The choice of the cast, most of them newcomers, was a joint effort by Kavya, Shabna and Unni. The actors, says Kavya, attended a three-day workshop.
“It was more of an ice-breaker than an acting camp. As most of them were new, I wanted them to be comfortable. I wanted them to feel free to pose questions, like why their character reacts to a situation in certain way, for instance. I believe the more comfortable your team is, the better their performance on screen will be.”
Although her father, a two-time National Award winning director, is an executive producer of the film, Kavya relied on him for just emotional support.

“I didn’t ask him for any guidance. I was clear that the film had my all; it is my baby. Only then can I take satisfaction with the outcome,” says the 27-year-old who doesn’t believe in having things handed to her on a silver platter.
Says Kavya: “I worked in the corporate field and the advertisement industry before joining my dad’s office. Even then, I started from scratch; I didn’t want to be treated differently just because I am VK Prakash’s daughter.

"‘Baaghi 3’ movie review: Beyond the Tiger Shroff voyeurism, there is little else to this film",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/baaghi-3-movie-review-beyond-the-tiger-shroff-voyeurism-there-is-little-else-to-this-film/article31000335.ece,"Filmmaker Ahmed Khan seems to have a fetish for installation art, that too the kind that involves modes of transport. So you have one action sequence shot against the backdrop of several hundreds of colourful cars piled up, one atop another, in a circle. In the middle of this car, Tiger Shroff displays his chops. Homage to Rohit Shetty films? Not quite. Some hours into the film and there is another automobilian sculpture — three helicopters, one over the other, with Tiger on top, burning bright, seemingly signalling to the baddies below — “I am the cub (if not the tiger king) of the world”.
In the third instalment of the Baaghi franchise, Tiger returns as Ronnie, as does Shraddha Kapoor as his lady love Siya. Ronnie goes on a one-man mission to Syria to save his elder brother, cop Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) who has been kidnapped by an Islamic terrorist organisation while on an assignment there.
Baaghi 3Director: Ahmed KhanStarring: Tiger Shroff, Riteish Deshmukh, Shraddha Kapoor, Jaideep Ahlawat, Vijay Varma, Jameel KhouryRun time: 143 minutesStoryline: Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) goes on a one man mission to Syria to save his elder brother, cop Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) who has been kidnapped by an Islamic terrorist outfit while on an assignment
In keeping with the nationalistic fervour of the times, Baaghi 2 had shown a lot of respect for the army; cops can be bad, army men can’t, it seemed to say. Here it’s a cop who is handily eulogised for protecting innocent people and laying down his own life in riots. Given the current state of affairs, it’s not unusual then to wonder if the entire sequence was truly prescient or was it programmed into the script later, considering the police is otherwise not shown in a great light the film. The nod to the recent ‘Bollywood police’ genre — Dabangg and Singham and the foreshadowing of Sooryavanshi — also seem intentional.
The rebel Ronnie who breaks bones, teeth and jaws of the street side taporis to begin with becomes “America, Russia, Mossad”, all rolled into one against the might of the dreaded Islamic terrorist Abu Jalal (Jameel Khoury). Bombs, explosions, landmines: nothing can stop him from wreaking a vengeance which becomes laughably improbable and inane in the climax. In the middle, many stereotypes gets reinforced, visually, and in the writing and dialogue. Asinine jokes about the towers in the men’s loo and about surnames like Kute abound in the name of humour. 
Despite sporting an impassive face, a perennially faraway look and moist eyes, Tiger Shroff has managed to forge his way ahead in Bollywood with some lithe, aesthetic stunts. He is agile and athletic, poses and posturises with a choreographed grace and daintiness. An overmuscled, overbronzed body demands display. So, somewhere down the line, a rag of a shirt hung loosely on his body also gets conveniently ripped apart. Beyond this Tiger voyeurism, there is little else to the film. Seasoned actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Vijay Varma are made to ham, Shraddha Kapoor is more of a comic relief in the name of being the leading lady and Riteish Deshmukh appears to keep eating dahi for good luck. There is a phrase in Hindi: dimaag ka dahi, the curdling of brain. That’s what the film does to your mind, leaves you all woolly-headed.",movies
"‘O Pitta Katha’ movie review: Showcases a new talent, but ultimately disappointing ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o-pitta-katha-movie-review-showcases-a-new-talent-but-ultimately-disappointing/article31000144.ece,"This story takes place in a village in Kakinada. The heroine Venkatalakshmi (Nitya Shetty) is a devotee of Sai Baba and believes that if one writes letters to eleven people professing their faith in the Saint, their wishes will be fulfilled. Since letter writing is non-existent now, we are made to believe the story is set in the 80s, but one of the heroes, Krish (Vishwant) actually asks her in the age of WhatsApp and emails, why is there a necessity to hand over letters.
The film marks the debut of character artiste Brahmaji’s son Sanjay Rao and also an official debut of Chandu Muddu as a director.
Venkatalakshmi is the only daughter and her father owns a cinema hall. He was once a mere worker in the cinema hall and wooed the owner’s daughter every time she came to see a film and eventually married her. Another worker has a son around the same time Venkatalakshmi is born. The boy Prabhu (Sanjay) grows up to be jealous that his father is still in the same position, he on his part has not been able to clear his exams and to adding to his woes, the girl once in love with him is leaning towards her NRI cousin Krish. He hoped that if he marries Venkatalakshmi, the cinema hall would be his.
We are made to believe that Prabhu is a negative character and our sympathies are aligned towards Krish. The only interesting part of the film is its screenplay. The story is told in each person’s perspective to a cop (Brahmaji) when Venkatalakshmi suddenly goes missing. Nitya Shetty who worked as a child in films, is just adequate here and it is Sanjay who makes a promising debut. His work is effortless and shows his ease in every frame.
Chandu had earlier directed Aa Oorlo O Sari Yemjarigindhante, but it didn’t get a proper release. The film showcased his talent and one wished with another chance he could prove himself in the industry. Sadly here, there is no upgrading in terms of dialogues or entertainment despite having the scope. Songs are pleasing but cinematography highlights the limitations of the artistes. Brahmaji’s hype and publicity should have been low key, it only revealed who actually is the hero of the film.
We look for at least one moment which will grab our attention, but there isn’t any. Other than showcasing an entry of a new talent, there is nothing much to drive home about.",movies
"Not another teen drama: On Netflix's new show, 'I Am Not Okay With This' ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-am-not-okay-with-this-may-look-like-yet-another-teen-drama-but-offers-more/article30999480.ece,"Netflix is obsessed with teenagers. Or wait, is it the other way round?
We are only two months into 2020, and the streaming service has already given us that lukewarm sequel to that film about that teen who wrote letters to all the boys she loved before, and which gave the Internet that swoon-worthy pin-up. There is also that new (stellar) season of that show about teens experiencing sexual awakening. And last week, Netflix dropped I Am Not Okay With This, a new show about yet another confused, angsty teen coming to terms with — what else but — a whole lot of curveballs pubescence throws her way.
This girl, Sydney, hasn’t yet wrapped her head around the recent death of her father; she may be in love with her best (girl) friend, who’s in turn smitten with the annoying school jock; and she is struggling to come to terms with bodily changes… like zits on her thighs. Nothing new here, you might say. 
But wait, there is a twist: Sydney may have telekinetic abilities. Only, it is not some cool superpower kids in Marvel stories (or even other Netflix shows like Stranger Things) use to save the world. Instead, it is a force that awakens during Sydney’s darkest moments, like when she is furious about getting second-hand treatment by her bestie, or when immense grief over her parent’s death strikes. It is quite possible that Charles Forsman, whose comic book the show is based on, thought, “What if teen angst was a superpower?” and then wove a story around it.
Two previously frothy movie genres — the teen movie and the superhero movie — have been mined for dark TV lately. Both these strands combine in I Am Not Okay With This, and rather well. Director Jonathan Entwistle has a knack for presenting clichéd adolescent issues through an interesting new lens, as he showed in The End Of The F*cking World. (You guessed it. Another Netflix teen show.) That, too, was an adaptation of a Forsman graphic novel, and the director and author are clearly in fine sync.
This time, they serve up an expectedly dark but also unassumingly wicked teen drama that has the ability to surprise you. I ventured into it with pretty much the same attitude I do other shows about young adults nowadays (“Ack! One more.”), but stayed around till the rather satisfying end. There is also the lovely Sophia Lillis, who has been turning up in films (It) and TV shows (Sharp Objects) lately, and she plays Sydney with understated, twisted charm. Wyatt Oleff (another It alumni) plays Stanley Barber, a boy who is smitten with Sydney, and he’s a real find, too.
If you can look past familiar teen show tropes in the early moments, you will find that I Am Not Okay With This slowly transforms into an unsettling drama that, at seven 20-odd-minutes-long episodes, is a breeze. A short teen show — small mercies!
Season One of I Am Not Okay With This is now streaming on Netflix.

Television host Yyamini Padma reveals why her role in serial 'Thoorpu Padamara' is special,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yyamini-padma-speaks-about-her-new-serial-thoorpu-padamara/article30999310.ece,"Staying away from scheming, corrupt narratives, the new series Thoorpu Padamara on Zee TV presents a refreshing storyline. Yyamini Padma playing Laya in the daily series is confident of it creating an enduring appeal. “The drama is relatable and entertaining,” she says. Yyamini plays a traditional girl with a love for simple things; her life takes a 360 degree turn when she gets married to a man who appreciates western culture. It is also a story of two friends — an optimistic Laya (“Even a broken clock is right twice”) and the sceptical Shruti (Jaya Kavi).
In the series, Yyamini shares a Tom and Jerry kind of relationship with Aishwarya, her grand mother (Nagamani). The reason: The grandmother wants her to be modern and this conflict and arguments between them are presented in an humorous way. She says: “We all have that one person in the family with whom we share a love-hate relationship. Many will be able to connect to our complex relationship and it evokes laughter.”

Yyamini hails from Warangal and the Commerce graduate’s television début was in and as Chinna Kodalu. She played Bhoomi in Muthyala Muggu (her all-time favourite role) and also Meenakshi, a visually-challenged girl who transforms her disability into strength to protect her family. Yyamini reveals that doing only four projects in a span of eight years was an informed choice. “Too many characters can sometimes evoke boredom among the audience. I wanted to carve a niche and create an identity for my roles.” 
For Yyamini, playing Laya is special as the character is close to her in real life. She has a select few friends, is rooted to tradition and prefers spending time with her kith and kin. “I am a simple, proud Telugu girl who likes to wear clothes that I am comfortable in. During my non-shooting days, I prefer a no make-up and jewellery look and when I go out, many do not recognise me.”

Yyamini is confident Thoorpu Padamara will appeal even to younger audiences. “The content, especially the comedy that unravels in the storyline, will be entertaining. The series portrays our lives, the way we talk or have fun with our family members. It is nice to watch a television series that brings a smile to the face than a frown. This is also the first time that I am doing a light-hearted role and wear salwar kameezes.” 
She often shuttles between Hyderabad and Warangal, and makes it a point to spend time with her family. “I like to give my best in whatever I do and once I put on make-up, I give my 100 percent.” In her free time, she loves watching movies. “I am inspired by the kind of roles that Trisha and Ramya Krishnan did. Today’s films focus mostly on the heroes and actresses do not get much space to perform.”

A project long in the running, fans of the game have been waiting for years for news of this official announcement, after several former collaborations to do the same fell through.
Now, the game will be adapted by The Last of Us co-director and writer Neil Druckmann, as well as Craig Mazin, who will once again work with HBO after the critical success of Chernobyl, states The Hollywood Reporter. Mazin who has an extensive body of work — The Hangover II, The Hangover III, and The Huntsman: Winter’s War — has created, written, and executive produced Chernobyl.
“From the first time I sat down to talk with Craig, I was equally blown away by his approach to narrative, and his love and deep understanding of The Last of Us. With Chernobyl, Craig and HBO created a tense, harrowing, emotional masterpiece. I couldn’t think of better partners to bring the story of The Last of Us to life as a television show,” Druckmann said in a prepared statement.
Mazin, on his part, said that Druckmann was the “finest storyteller working in the video game medium” and the game as his “magnum opus.”
The Last of Us follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler with a dark past who is travelling across post-apocalyptic US, along with a 14-year-old girl Ellie, who he has to deliver safely as she maybe the answer to cure a deadly pandemic that is turning people into monsters. The immersive experience and movie-like events of the title has won it many ‘Game of The Year’ awards and has sold over 17 million copies across both its original release on the PlayStation 3 and a remastered version on PlayStation 4.
The TV adaptation will be produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions (the first TV show from the latter). An announcement is expected to be made about the cast and crew in the coming months.
Meanwhile, the sequel to the game, The Last of Us Part II, is scheduled to released May 29, and the TV show could also feature additional content from the second game as well. ",movies

 The Oompa-Loompas are little humans who were preyed upon in Loompaland before Wonka invited them to work at his chocolate factory. They are paid in cocoa beans and love practical jokes and singing songs. 
Netflix said the animation series would “retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time.”

‘Velvet Nagaram’ movie review: Varalaxmi struggles in a movie that is both confusing and patchy ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/velvet-nagaram-movie-review-varalaxmi-struggles-in-a-movie-that-is-both-confusing-and-patchy/article30998790.ece,"They say that the first 20 minutes of a movie would determine if you are really into it or not. I reject Brotman’s Law when it comes Tamil cinema. For me, what matters is the opening sequence — if it begins with an aerial shot showing the vast expanse of a picturesque location or a locality, I’m already out. Sure, there have been movies that have had absurd opening shots but turned out surprisingly good by the end of it.
Velvet Nagaram opens with a drone-shot of wildfire in Kodaikanal and a voice-over on the atrocities faced by the tribal community inhabiting the region. What did I just say in the previous paragraph? It is a dull scene that sets precedent for a duller movie. You sense a lack of interest — both in the actors and the director — right from the start. What is even more distressing is the lethargic attitude of the director who seems to reject the notion of what is called as plot building exercise. We are absolutely dependent on dialogues to understand what is happening on screen and between the characters. 
Velvet NagaramCast: Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Maalavika Sundar, Ramesh Thilak, Kasturi Shankar and Santhosh KrishnaDirector: Manojkumar NatarajanStoryline: A journalist’s life is at stake when she uncovers a dark truth about Kodaikanal forest fire, fuelled by a corporate giant with the Government’s hand in it. What extent would she go, to save her life and to expose the truth?
Allow me to give you a sample of this. Social activist and actor Gowri (Kasturi Shankar) has been brutally killed for discovering a vital piece of information about the Kodaikanal forest fire. She claims it was orchestrated by a corporate giant called Advaita and not a natural disaster. There isn’t visual evidence to substantiate her argument. We are told who she is and what she does through a phone call that she has with her friend Usha (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar). Now, you are like: “Who is Usha, dude?” Don’t worry, says the director. In the next scene, we are told who Usha is. When she goes to the crime scene, we learn that she is a journalist. You heave a sigh of relief. However, you are still divided on whether she is an investigative journalist or a talk show host. You put those thoughts aside, but soon realise that Velvet Nagaram is as messed up as Usha’s one-dimensional character. 
Just when you are about to come to a conclusion that it is going to be a murder-mystery, it goes into a different territory and becomes another movie — like a home-invasion thriller. I, for one, didn’t see that coming. But does it achieve that? No. Take Ashwin Saravanan’s Game Over, which is a far superior movie and dealt with a similar premise. Everything was crystal clear on paper, even though it had a twisted narrative structure. But here, everything is hastily put together. New characters, who have no relevance to the larger design of the movie, are thrown into the proceedings. Maybe I didn’t follow what transpired in-between (let me confess; I dozed off for like a solid five minutes). Velvet Nagaram still could have been a watchable home invasion thriller had it not been bogged down by lazy writing.
Manojkumar Natarajan claims to be Quentin Tarantino’s fan and you understand why. His directorial debut comes across as the work of an independent filmmaker, given its patchy look and feel. The movie, in fact, begins with QT’s quote: “I steal from every great movie ever made.” Sometimes, it is absolutely okay to lift ideas provided the movie is engaging on some level.",movies
Singer Srinivas on returning to independent music with ‘Nenjil Oru Vannam’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/singer-srinivas-interview/article30998044.ece,"Way back in 2001, singer Srinivas came up with ‘Ussele Ussele’, a song from a pop album that created waves for being shot like a music video. It was a big hit, but Srinivas did not attempt such a thing again, since he got busy with film songs and concerts.
He is back to the independent music space with ‘Nenjil Oru Vannam’, releasing today.
It all started when he composed a song on colours. When he pitched the number to Nippon Paint, they were interested — and tweaked the concept to be an empowering video which focusses on the girl child and her struggle to shine in a challenging environment that refuses to acknowledge her talent.
“I meet so many singers and musicians who keep complaining about the decrease in the quality of songs today. But why aren’t we doing anything about it?” he asks.
Part of what he is trying to do is re-imagining the independent music scene with his musical outings. “There cannot be anything better than creating a path of your own with your music,” he says, “It’s high time that singers start creating their own independent stuff, and performing that in concerts. Today, you don’t need a music company, and thanks to everything being digital, you can shoot a video and put it out there.”
Is the move because of a lack of offers on the film front? “I sang for Imman’s Pon Manickavel, but that’s about it. I’m not complaining, though, because the current crop of youngsters should get the kind of opportunities I got back then,” says the singer.
He hopes that ‘Nenjil Oru Vannam’ will be added to a playlist that boasts superhits like ‘Minsara Poove’, ‘En Uyire’ and ‘Azhagae Sugama’.
Also on the cards is another independent musical effort that will be a ‘thank you’ number for everybody associated with his musical journey. “I touched the landmark 60 years recently, and it has been more than 25 years in the film industry. As far as music is concerned, there’s nothing called retirement. I’m happy that I’m still singing, and that music still excites me like it did back then.”",movies
"Cannes Film Festival to go ahead, despite concerns over coronavirus outbreak ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cannes-film-festival-to-go-ahead-despite-concerns-over-coronavirus-outbreak/article30995336.ece,"With the French Health Minister extending the ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces to May 31, fresh concerns arose on Thursday over the novel coronavirus outbreak affecting the 73rd edition of Cannes Film Festival, scheduled to be held from May 12 to 23. 
Putting speculations to rest, a spokesperson of the festival told The Hindu on a long distance call, “As of today, there is nothing to indicate that it [the festival] will not go ahead as planned. Everything is going on as normal right now in the office in Paris.”
While the organisers are committed to follow the Minister’s “specific instructions”, the rules don’t seem come in the way of the festival. Two of the biggest auditoriums at the venue — Palais des Festivals et des Congres — are Lumiere and Debussy, with a capacity of 2,309 and 1,068 respectively. So there is hardly any probability of a gathering of more than 5,000 people at the same time in one location for the festival screenings. Cannes Film Market, however, may have to be more closely monitored.
Regarding fears that attendance of film personalities, media and cinephiles may dwindle this year, the spokesperson said: “We will discover in the next few weeks. It’s hard to tell how the situation evolves.” As of now, the festival is committed to announce the official selection mid April; April 16 in all likelihood.
The one time Cannes was brought to a halt in recent history, midway at that, was in 1968, when several filmmakers — including Jean-Luc Godard, 
François Truffaut and Claude Lelouch — showed solidarity with striking students and workers resisting Charles de Gaulle’s government. Some like Alain Resnais withdrew their movies, while others like Roman Polanski, Monica Vitti and Louis Malle resigned from the jury. ",movies

The government has placed a moratorium on Yes Bank with eﬀect from March 5 till April 3. Deposit withdrawals have been capped at ₹50,000 during this period.
“The resolution [of Yes Bank] will be done very swiftly, it will be done very fast. The 30 days which we have given is the outer limit.

He reiterated that the Indian banking system is safe and sound. “Depositors’ interest [of Yes Bank] will be protected,” Mr. Das assured.
He said the decision on Yes Bank was taken at a larger level, not only to deal with the
problem in an individual entity, but also to maintain stability and resilience of the Indian ﬁnancial and banking sector. “We stand committed to maintaining stability of the ﬁnancial and banking sector,” he said. On the timing of the ac
tion on Yes Bank, Mr. Das said there was always a debate over the Reserve Bank of India either acting prematurely or taking too long to act. “A market-led and bankled resolution of the problem is always preferable. You have to give time to the bank management to take step and eﬀorts.
And the bank did take eﬀorts.” he said. “When we found that we cannot wait and should not wait any longer, we decided to intervene. I think the timing is appropriate,” Mr. Das added.

Shares of Yes Bank lost nearly 85% during intra-day trades to touch a low of ₹5.55 — it closed at ₹36.85 on Thursday — before settling the day at ₹16.20, a fall of 56.04% compared to the previous day’s close. Meanwhile, SBI lost a little over 6% to close at ₹270.45.
Incidentally, the BSE Bankex lost over 1,100 points due to the weakness in most banking stocks on Friday. The overall market breadth was extremely negative, with more than 1,900 stocks losing ground as against less than 500 gainers.

Khelo India Winter Games kicked off in J&K,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/khelo-india-winter-games-kicked-off-in-jk/article31011206.ece,"With awareness posters on COVID-19 dotting the snow-bound venue of Gulmarg, the first Khelo India Winter Games began in north Kashmir on Saturday, the first mega sports event to be held in the Valley since the Centre revoked J&K’s special status last August.
“This is a historic event not only for J&K but the whole country. Those who are here today at this place are lucky. This is the beginning of mega sports events in Gulmarg. More mega events are in the pipeline for this place,” Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Kiren Rijiju said, while inaugurating the games.
Nearly 900 sportspersons from 20 States are participating in 30 events, including snowboarding, skiing, cross-country games and a snow show at the venue located at an altitude of 8,694 feet.
The Centre has decided to set up a national excellence centre of winter sports in Gulmarg. “It will be a residential facility financed by the Centre where professional winter games athletes will be trained for world-class competitions. Besides, coaches of different sports categories will be given ₹5 lakh for setting up sports centres across J&K,” Mr. Rijiju said.

Farooq Khan, Adviser to the J&K Lieutenant-Governor, termed the event “a game changer for bringing J&K back on the track of prosperity and development”.

“The whole world is on a high alert and is putting precautionary measures in place, including cancelling all small and big events, to contain the spread. Having an event like Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg between March 7 and 11 is highly irresponsible. The event has created a hysteria among the masses, and if such gatherings add to the number of the infected, the government should completely be held responsible,” said Shaikh Ghulam Rasool, chairman of the J&K RTI Movement.
Responding to the criticism, Mr. Rijiju said, “Five screening layers have been set up from the Srinagar airport up to the venue. It’s all well managed. There is no need to worry.” Scores of posters on how to battle COVID-19 have been pasted at multiple points in Gulmarg to educate the participants about the precautions to take.

The 23-year-old top seed, prevailed 3-2 in a split decision after a fast-paced bout in which fortunes swung quite wildly.
 Panghal will next face a familiar opponent in Carlo Paalam, whom he beat in the semifinals of the 2018 Asian Games and the 2019 Worlds quarterfinals.
Panghal had to dig deep to edge past an aggressive and energetic Kharhuu. The Indian was quick on his feet, displayed a terrific counter-attacking game and his left hand proved to be especially effective in the first two rounds.
Divided verdict
 However, the Mongolian sustained the pressure in the final three minutes in which Panghal seemed a bit off-colour. But he managed just enough to pull through and fetch a divided verdict. 
In another intense pre-quarterfinals bout, Gaurav Solanki (57kg) lost 1-4 to top-seeded Uzbek Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov.

Panic gripped big tech firms like Facebook and Twitter which decided to close their offices from Seattle to London as more employees tested positive for the new coronavirus.
Facebook shut its three London offices till Monday after an employee was diagnosed with COVID-19.
The social networking giant told nearly 3,000 employees in London to work from home after an employee, who is based in Singapore but visited the London offices between February 24-26, was diagnosed with the new coronavirus, Sky News reported on Friday.
“An employee based in our Singapore office who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 visited our London offices on February 24-26. We are therefore closing our London offices until Monday for deep cleaning and employees are working from home until then,” the company said in a statement.
There have been 163 cases of coronavirus so far in the U.K.
Earlier, Facebook recommended all its Bay Area employees in the U.S. to work from home. The latest precautions come after San Francisco announced its first two coronavirus cases on Thursday.
Facebook has also shut its Seattle office until Monday after one of its contractors was confirmed to be infected with the virus. The infected contractor last visited the Facebook office on February 21. King County health officials said all Facebook sites should work from home until March 31.
Twitter shut its Seattle office for a ‘deep clean’ after an employee developed COVID-19 like symptoms though final result was still awaited.
“A Seattle-based employee has been advised by doctor about likely COVID-19, though still awaiting the final testing,” Twitter said in a tweet on Friday.
“While the employee has not been at a Twitter office for several weeks and hasn’t been in contact w/others, we’re closing our Seattle office to deep clean,” the company added.

"For years, we’ve enjoyed the flavour that other cultures have added to our lives",https://www.thehindu.com/society/for-years-weve-enjoyed-the-flavour-that-other-cultures-have-added-to-our-lives/article31001554.ece,"Imagine a table laden with dishes… or a thali laden with mounds of fresh, lightly tempered vegetables and little katoris of runny jhols, thick kormas, pachadis and raitas… all the same uniform colour. Even if that colour is the brightest turmeric yellow, saffron orange, or chilli red… or the most intense spinach emerald or fresh coriander green. 
The image doesn’t make the heart sing. Everything on the table the same red: tomatoes, carrots, beetroot. Or everything beige: potatoes, chicken curry, dal, paratha. Or a medley of most people’s ‘favourite’ things: brown korma, chana, and brown crisply fried potato wedges. I’d much rather it was a heap of unadorned white rice, a yellow dal sunny with turmeric, a curry ruby-red with fried tomatoes, a golden-brown gravy of mutton chops, a heap of fresh tender beans as green as grass with maybe a roasted papad on the side, crisped almost black at the edges. 
Or imagine a lifetime of three meals a day, each the same: aloo matar, phulka. Or mutton korma, tandoori roti. At breakfast, lunch and dinner, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday… Or dal and rice. Or a cheese omelette with toasted white bread. Every day, day in, day out and meal in, meal out. They’re all quite delicious, but the more if occasional. I love yellow dhokla speckled with black mustard seeds, but then should I abjure plain fluffy white idlis? There are serious economic issues related to food and nutrition, but for those of us privileged enough to have access to all the food we need, variety is truly what makes the world go round. It’s also a happy coincidence that, according to food experts, eating all food types is better for balanced health.
New foods come into our reach as the world gets smaller. Much has been written about the origin of potatoes and chillies, about how we were introduced to them only when the Portuguese came to India not so long ago — and about the real provenance of recipes that we had considered ours — as if we ate biryani and samosa since time immemorial. We’ve enjoyed the flavour that other cultures have added to our lives, and are still discovering new foods. I may baulk at tandoori momos and dosas filled with chow mein, but do I have any right to lay down what’s legit and what ain’t? 
In our land, a continent more than a country, we’ve been blessed with diverse ingredients and spices; regional and cultural diversity fills our larders, spiking it with flavours from basil to asafoetida. Imagine spurning the rainbow and limiting ourselves to same old bread-and-butter. What were considered foreign, ‘English’ vegetables, like cauliflower and carrots, are now ‘normal’. Potatoes are staple. If we can absorb all of these in our daily cooking, it’s not a big stretch to acquaint ourselves with and appreciate more of the diversity that’s on our doorsteps. 
A kilo of ‘jugni’
Remember a time, not so long ago, when broccoli was ‘exotic’? Now Bhagwan Singh, my father’s major-domo, asks “Aaj broccoline (sic) ki aloo gobhi bana doon? (Shall I cook the broccoli like aloo-gobhi, potato-cauliflower?)” Because Daddy grows vegetables, and after he’s distributed a hundred kilos and is still left with another hundred, the chef tries to innovate. And it works — cooked aloo-gobhi style, with turmeric and a tempering of slivered ginger, broccoli is quite delicious. It doesn’t have to be used only in a Chinese stir-fry or baked in white sauce. Back in the day, zucchini was bought from fancy gourmet stores for special menus. Now, pushcart vendors sell it door-to-door practically around the year; only, they call it ‘jugni’. 
We have an abundance of ingredients and if we look beyond our noses, an abundance of cooking techniques. I was brought up in a largely Punjabi home and my mother made vegetables sometimes in a medium-thick gravy. The base was always puréed onions, and she used to ask how some kitchens produced ultra-smooth, thin gravies. She said she had tried but just couldn’t get it. 
I wish I knew then what I know now: that Indian gravies can be made without any onion at all. She had less exposure, there was no Internet, no cable TV, and Indian cookbooks were limited to narrow cuisines. Her only access to ‘other’ cooking was through Western cookery books and recipes in Woman and Home. 
Wildly exciting
We have food that’s shallow fried, steamed, braised, sautéed, roasted, grilled, charred and chilled. We simmer our fish in watery soups or thick pastes, sometimes after deep frying and sometimes without… and what a difference it makes to the jhol, jhaal or kaliya. A Kashmiri kaliya has some similarity, but different spices. 
I used to find that the cuisine of any part of India other than my own was wildly exciting and full of endless variety and possibility. Only after more exposure and more eating I find that there’s a limited repertoire in most spice cupboards. Some regions often use mustard seeds, chana dal and curry leaf in the tempering; some, closer home, are deadly boring because it’s cumin and coriander. All my mother’s mutton curries had the same spices — sometimes roasted, sometimes ground, sometimes whole — the only differentiator was the stage at which they were added to the dish. But eating and talking with friends, I increasingly find that their traditional food is a treasure chest of taste and if I borrow a pinch, my cooking is enhanced. 
But for that, I have to step out of the Lakshman rekha drawn by my upbringing, and be open to new ideas. It’s happened in the past, gradually and so surely that we now accept it as integral to our lives. If we could take proud ownership of ‘alien’ foods once, continuing to do so would enrich our present and the heritage of generations to come.
‘Kashmiri’ Mutton Koftas
Serves 3-4
(This is loosely based on a Kashmiri Pandit recipe called muchch/ mutsch, but with variations I like.)
Ingredients
400g lean mutton mince 
Marinade for mince
3 tsp mustard oil
1 tsp hung yoghurt (or 2-3 tsp solid yoghurt)
2 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder
2 drops of powdered hing (asafoetida) mixed in water
1/4 tsp powdered saunth (dried ginger)
½ tsp powdered saunf (fennel)
Salt
For the gravy
2 tbsp mustard oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 clove
1 green cardamom, broken
2-3 drops of hing solution
2 tsp hung yoghurt (or 2 tbsp firm yoghurt)
2 tsp chilli powder mixed in 1 cup water
Salt
1/4 tsp powdered saunth (dried ginger)
½ tsp powdered saunf (fennel)
Pinch of garam masala powder
Method
1. Thoroughly mix mince and marinade ingredients together. Shape into little torpedos, like mini cocktail sausages, and place neatly on a tray.
2. Start on the gravy: heat the mustard oil in a wide bottomed pan and fry cumin seeds till crisp. Add clove and cardamom (many people use black cardamom) followed by hing solution. Add yoghurt and keep stirring on medium heat till moisture evaporates and oil appears at the edges. 
3. Add chilli powder in water and stir in salt, saunth and saunf. 
4. When the liquid starts boiling, gently lower in koftas. Keep it bubbling till the water evaporates and the koftas start drying up. A thick spice-and-yoghurt paste will start wrapping around the koftas. Keep simmering on low heat and stirring with a spatula to prevent it catching. 
5. Meanwhile, boil another ¾ cup of water and pour it on to the sides of the kofta pan. Bring it to the boil, add garam masala powder and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve with steamed rice and a green vegetable, preferably leafy.

Centre invites bids for BPCL sale ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-invites-bids-for-bpcl-sale/article31010896.ece,"The government on Saturday invited bids for the sale of its entire 52.98% stake in country’s second biggest State-owned oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL).
However, amid falling oil prices, analysts believe that the government will find it difficult to get a good valuation for the company.
“The government’s plan to sell its stake in BPCL could be delayed, as many global oil majors that have been looking at the company as an outlet to refine their crude may revaluate their bids in a scenario of sinking oil prices,” said Fitch Ratings.
 Global oil majors, starting from world’s largest oil firm Saudi Aramco to U.S. major ExxonMobil, from Russia’s oil major Rosneft to Royal Dutch Shell, from Total of France to Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), are said to be interested in buying out the government’s stake in BPCL.
Expressions of interest for the strategic sale of BPCL have been invited by May 2, as per the bid document by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).
“The Government of India is proposing strategic disinvestment of its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising 114.91 crore equity shares, which constitute 52.98% of BPCL’s equity share capital, along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer (except BPCL’s equity shareholding of 61.65% in Numaligarh Refinery Limited),” said the bid document.
“Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell will be the front runners for BPCL. Saudi Aramco believes that their oil will last for eternity and so they want to get long-term crude supply contracts for Saudi oil. For Shell, tough environment norms in the West will be major factor to make refineries investment in India,” a director of an oil marketing company (OMC) told The Hindu.
BPCL shares on the BSE closed down 3.74% to ₹402.85 on the BSE in a weak Mumbai market on Friday, valuing the company at ₹87,388.4 crore.
The government has set $10 billion minimum net worth as one of the eligibility criteria in the expression of interest (EoI) for BPCL.
In case of a consortium of investors bidding for taking a stake in the oil refiner and marketer, the minimum net worth for each member has been set at $1 billion, according to the bid document.
The government has explicitly excluded public sector units (PSUs), having 51% government ownership, from bidding for BPCL, a move that will make Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) ineligible to bid for BPCL.",business

Luxury cars to see revival in 2021,https://www.thehindu.com/business/luxury-cars-to-see-revival-in-2021/article31010794.ece,"The luxury car market in India during 2020 will be flat and experience a positive revival in 2021, says Balbir Singh Dhillon, head, Audi India. Edited excerpts:
How was 2019 sales?
The auto industry faced strong headwinds in 2019. The economic slowdown in India last year tapered customer sentiments with potential car buyers delaying their buying decision. It was a challenging year as there was ambiguity about the life of BS IV vehicles on-road in the customer’s mind and anticipation of GST reduction on cars; both these topics were later clarified by the government. The year also saw the tightening of loans available to dealers and customers, which negatively impacted the sales of luxury car sales.
Every major luxury car player has de-grown in volumes during 2019 and we were not an exception. We sold 4,594 units in 2019 and continue to be one of the top choices for luxury car customers in India. What is notable is while the overall car market declined, we saw a strong traction in the luxury pre-owned car segment. Audi Approved: plus, our pre-owned car business, registered a year-on-year growth of 11% in 2019. 
Your outlook for 2020?
We have been optimistic about the growth of the luxury car segment on the back of the India growth story, which remains intact. We believe that the luxury car market will take a leap sometime in the future, we only don’t know when. In terms of growth estimates for the luxury car market, we estimate it to remain flat in 2020 and are hopeful of positive revival starting 2021.
What is the scenario for cars costing above ₹1 crore?
The recently launched Audi Q8 and the Audi A8 L form an extremely important part of our product portfolio for 2020 that focuses on the push for C & D segment cars. 
These products are big on customisation and exclusivity and hence, sold in limited numbers. So far, we have received an extremely positive response for both the Audi Q8 and the Audi A8 L from prospective customers.
Your take on EVs...
EV’s are the way forward but the market is not going to develop overnight. Infrastructure plays an important role. Tangible measures by the government towards e-mobility infrastructure and adequate support towards the import of electric vehicles would be a welcome move. Ideally, the government should do something for PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) because it is a step towards electrification. It is the first step that you bring people from ICE to PHEV and eventually take them to electric cars. We will launch our first electric car – the Audi e-tron and are upbeat about the India prospects. The showcase in India in 2019 generated excitement amongst enthusiasts and we are confident that the e-tron will be the right match for a dynamic market like India. A combination of technology, space and comfort, the e-tron is a luxury electric SUV with a range that is suitable for everyday use. The launch of Audi e-tron is on the cards and we will announce the launch timeline in due course.
Are you happy with market share for Audi?
We are not running behind market share but are eager to strengthen the Audi brand in India. Market share at any cost is not our approach. While shifting from BS IV to BS VI we have decided certain strategy goals for us that lead to making Audi a far stronger brand. The customer is at the core of our business – whatever we do; our utmost priority is our customers. We are not running behind being the leader in terms of volumes, we are instead focusing on building a profitable and sustainable business model. As a brand, we want to be sustainable not just by focusing on sales but “Quality of Sales” that lead to happy customers and a strong brand.
How many cars are lined up for 2020?
2020 will be an exciting year for Audi as far as new product launches are concerned. The year started on an exciting note with the launch of the Audi Q8 in January followed by the Audi A8 L in early February. Both these products have received a great media and customer response. We have some fantastic products coming over the next 9 months – these will be a mix of volume and RS models.
Can you spell out your dealer expansion?
We currently operate in 36 cities across India – with a total of 29 showrooms and 37 workshops. In addition, we have 7 Audi Approved: plus facilities. In 2019 – we opened new dealerships in important markets including Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata. The year 2020 kick-started with the announcement of a new dealer partner Mumbai. Our focus is also to expand to Tier II and III cities and making the network profitable and sustainable.
We have adopted a workshop-first approach — for instance, a place like Trivandrum still sells less number of cars and hence we opened a workshop first and not a showroom.

The buzz is that Regina has a strong women-centric role in this mystery drama that’s a Tamil-Telugu bilingual and directed by Caarthick Raju. Set against a period backdrop, this team is reportedly shooting in some never-before-seen lush locales in Tamil Nadu.
Ponmagal Vandhal







Jyotika has been doing some interesting roles in her second innings. And 2020 will see her play a laywer in Ponmagal Vandhal. Directed by Frederick and supposed to be a thriller, PV, which is slated to hit screens soon, has been produced by Suriya’s 2D Entertainment. 
Mookuthi Amman







Christened the ‘Lady Superstar’ of Tamil cinema, Nayanthara plays an ‘Amman’ in this upcoming film that has been directed by RJ Balaji and NJ Saravanan. The film marks RJ Balaji’s debut as a director and is slated to be a ‘devotional film with a twist’. We’re waiting. Are you?
Nishabdam (Silence)







If not for anything, fans of Anushka Shetty will just be happy to see her on screen again after a gap of over two years. That the talented actress can carry off any role isn’t a debate any more: her repertoire of diverse work speaks for itself. But it does remain a mystery why she doesn’t take on more projects. With Silence, a horror-mystery, where she plays a speech and hearing-impaired character, the Baahubali star will showcase a wide range of her potent acting skills — and we couldn’t be more thrilled for her.
Raangi







Trisha’s had middling success with female-centric movies in her career, with the likes of her Jessies and Jaanus in dramas faring much better. However, the actor’s 2020 looks primed to kill: first up is Raangi in which she plays a modern-day journalist, on a mission to take down a nefarious operation. She also has the Tamil remake of NH10 in Garjanai, and an untitled venture she headlines with Petta co-star Simran! What’s not to love?
Penguin







Ever since Mahanati, Keerthy Suresh’s career graph has climbed higher and higher. Her deserved National Award for the movie only cemented her place as one of south India’s best performers, capable of headlining a movie on her own, and set the box-office ringing. Penguin, produced by Karthik Subbaraj, looks to further that trend; very little is known about the Eashvar Kartic directorial, except that the poster shows Keerthy as a pregnant woman. Murder-mystery? Horror-thriller? A romantic vacation in the woods gone wrong? Only time will tell.
Paris Paris







Part of the long-mooted four southern remakes of Queen, the Tamil version sees the formidable Kajal Aggarwal step into the shoes of Kangana’s now iconic character of Rani Mehra from the original. A tried-and-tested storyline, an experienced director in Ramesh Aravind, and in Kajal, a bonafide star who finally wants to prove that she can make a film work without a leading man alongside her: Expectations are high.
Adho Andha Paravai Pola







Post Aadai, Amala Paul is a force to reckon with. In this film, directed by Vinoth KR, Amala gets all adventurous and explores a forest where mystery awaits her. There have been certain delays in its release, and we’re hoping they get cleared soon.
Velvet Nagaram







Her Velvet Nagaram has just hit screens, and Varalaxmi already has a couple of films, including Krack, that she has a prominent role in. Slowly moving away from heroine and character to roles to playing the lead, this sassy actor is sure looking at a busy 2020 up ahead.",movies

Woody Allen’s memoir ‘Apropos of Nothing’ cancelled by Hachette Book Group ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/woody-allens-memoir-apropos-of-nothing-cancelled-by-hachette-book-group/article31008676.ece,"Woody Allen’s autobiography was dropped by publisher Hachette Book Group following the controversial director’s estranged children, Ronan Farrow and Dylan Farrow, condemning the plan, and a protest by the company’s employees.
“The decision to cancel Mr. Allen’s book was a difficult one,” Hachette said in a statement on Twitter on Friday, reports eonline.com.
“At HBG, we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books. As publishers, we make sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard.”
Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette, announced on Monday that his book Apropos of Nothing would be released in April.
Ronan, whose 2019 book about sexual misconduct by men in the workplace, Catch and Kill, was published by another imprint of the group, slammed the decision on Twitter a day later.
He said his sister “has never been contacted to respond to any denial or mischaracterisation of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Woody Allen”.
Ronan had condemned his father publicly after Dylan, one of Woody and ex Mia Farrow’s adopted children, in 2014 accused the director of past sexual abuse.
He has denied Dylan’s allegations and has never been charged with a sex crime.
“It’s wildly unprofessional, in multiple obvious directions, for Hachette to behave this way,” Ronan wrote in his tweet.
“But it also shows a lack of ethics and compassion for victims of sexual abuse, regardless of any personal connection or breach of trust here. I’ve encouraged Hachette, out of respect for its readers, authors, and reputation, to conduct a thorough fact check of Woody Allen’s account, in particular any claim that implies my sister is not telling the truth. I’ve also told Hachette that a publisher that would conduct itself in this way is one I can’t work with in good conscience.”
Dylan had also condemned Hachette’s plan to publish Woody’s autobiography, saying in a statement on Twitter on Monday: “Hachette’s publishing of Woody Allen’s memoir is deeply unsettling to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men.
“For the record, I was never contacted by any fact checkers to verify the information in this memoir, demonstrating an egregious abdication of Hachette’s most basic responsibility.”
A day before Hachette announced the cancellation of Woody’s memoir, Hachette employees staged a walkout to protest their company’s plans to publish the book.
“As a company, we are committed to offering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff. Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others,” Hachette’s statement said.
“After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG,” they added.",movies
We have to look at cinema beyond the lens of business: Subrata Beura,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/we-have-to-look-at-cinema-beyond-the-lens-of-business-subrata-beura/article30999134.ece,"The Film Society of Bhubaneswar (FSB) was started in 2004 and since then the organisation has consistently been holding monthly screenings, film festivals and retrospectives. It has screened more than 500 films from across the world and held conversations, master classes, readings, art exhibitions and workshops around cinema. It also organises the Indian Film Festival of Bhubaneswar (IFFB), the only film festival in the country with a focus on Indian cinema. The latest edition was held in January this year. Subrata Beura — formerly the director of business planning and strategy at an American IT firm — was the festival coordinator of IFFB 2020; he is also the Secretary of FSB. He spoke about the challenges of running a film society in Odisha and the emerging indie cinescape. Excerpts:
As FSB was launched in the winter of 2004, I was involved with friends Satyajit Puhan, Bharadwaj Panda and filmmaker Subas Das, but stayed in the background — buying films during my travels abroad and slowly building a film archive. 
I had an epiphany on November 8, 2016. I was in London, working on a European workforce reduction plan, when demonetisation was announced. The next morning, I woke up to the news of the Trump victory. I decided I could not work to strengthen the ruling elites any longer. I quit my job in February 2017, relocated to my hometown, Bhubaneswar, in 2018, and became a full-time worker at FSB. 
The city is a space for young people to escape from. Young women in colleges and universities live under curfew; they are debarred from an evening in the city, as hostels shut women in by 5-6 p.m. So, the biggest challenge is to find people who will engage in voluntary work. Our universities don’t offer cinema as a subject of study. The film society movement is non-existent.

IFFB was started with the realisation that we didn’t have a festival dedicated to showcasing the diversity of contemporary Indian cinema. The idea was to bring to our audience films made in languages such as Khasi, Ladakhi etc. that are difficult to access. It was also important to focus on first-time filmmakers. We decided to shift the focus of our festivals and launch IFFB in 2017. We’ve also started to focus on Indian documentary films since 2018, with a separate festival called the Indian Documentary Film Festival of Bhubaneswar.
The focus of IFFB 2020 was to showcase the diversity of contemporary Indian cinema, the works of debutant filmmakers, to ask important questions of our times surrounding identity, food, gender, economic development, social strife and possibilities of compassion. Aani Maani by Fahim Irshad Khan, Aise hi by Kislay, Lorni by Wanphrang Diengdoh, Cat Sticks by Ronny Sen, and Ghode ko Jalebi Khilane Le Ja Riya Hoon by Anamika Haksar are some of the outstanding films that we had the honour to screen this year. 
Apart from the filmmakers I have mentioned, whose work we featured this year, Rima Das is a significant voice whose works engage with very local realities in a contemporary and powerful fashion. Hemant Gaba’s work on Kota (An Engineered Dream) brings out the political economy of our education system. Mukul Haloi from Assam (Ghormuha) is also an emerging filmmaker to track. One has to watch the works of the Ektara Collective (Turup) from Bhopal as they explore the majoritarian challenges we face today in a nuanced manner. Stanzin Dorjai Gya (Shepherdess of the Glaciers, Growing in the Himalayas) from Leh is a documentarian whose works tell stories of people from trans-Himalaya in a language distinctly his own. 






Still from ‘Aani Maani’.
 






We in Odisha are around 4% of national population; our programming reflects that proportion. But we are always on the lookout for Odia films. The matter of concern is student films; we don’t get Odia movies for our student film competition section. We are always looking for Odia cine classics as well. But due to lack of archival and digital material available at the National Film Archive of India and in the State, one is handicapped. 
In India and elsewhere, no successful film festival has thrived without the support of the government and city councils. We in Bhubaneswar do not have that. Whatever support we get, we use. One needs to see what that support is being used for. We need to build more inclusive cultural spaces where women, the elderly and children feel comfortable and can express themselves. We at FSB are planning to introduce a children’s film festival to the city’s cultural calendar.
Every day we hear of oppressive structures clamping down on constitutional rights. Filmmakers and curators have a role to engage with our social, political and economic realities. The political role of cinema is to enable reimagining a just and inclusive society by opening up spaces for conversations.
This is a question of policy. Let us deconstruct the new film policy of the Government of Odisha. One notices the fascination with big numbers, talk of ₹100 crore-plus budgets and tax exemptions, about distribution and screening spaces by tie-ups with multiplexes. We have to look at cinema beyond the lens of business. One dreams of a platform that can support young filmmakers from Odisha who can make works in Odia, Munda, Kui and Santhali languages.

Reversing privilege in ‘Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan’ and ‘Chhoti si Baat’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/reversing-privilege-in-arvind-desai-ki-ajeeb-dastaan-and-chhoti-si-baat/article30998907.ece,"Revisiting two 1970s Hindi films recently, I was struck by light-hearted scenes that showed how the underprivileged can deal with the privileged without direct confrontation. Humour, including biting sarcasm, can be one such tool; so can pure fantasy, which allows you to ‘reverse’ a situation — even if the reversal occurs only in your head.
Rich lad Arvind Desai buys four bottles of Black Label (beer, not whisky!) at a shop. He hands over a currency note and then walks away clutching the bottles as the vendor’s assistant calls out to him to take the change. But instead of being grateful for this casually bestowed ‘tip’, the shopkeeper shakes his head and chuckles: “Rehne do, yaar. Saalon ko paise lene mein bhi takleef hoti hai.” (These wealthy people find it troublesome even to take their money back.)
In an earlier scene in this film, Saeed Mirza’s Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan, the protagonist — heir to a business empire but also a troubled young man experiencing a nascent form of political awareness — has a self-congratulatory glow on his face after showing kindness to a street boy. But we then see this boy making fun of Arvind behind his back.
Sly observation
 Mirza’s film offers more hard-hitting variants on the theme of the poor meeting the privileged gaze: it ends with exploited carpet-weavers staring accusingly at the camera. But that casual ten-second scene at the theka operates in a much lighter register, wittily undercutting the self-congratulatory delusions of the “benevolent” rich and making a sly observation about the Indian class waltz, one that is equally pertinent in the soft-socialist and the post-economic liberalisation eras.
The scene might also make you ask what Arvind was really intending to do, a question that is inseparable from the casting of the young and callow Dilip Dhawan in the part. Dhawan, though very likable, had a limited acting range, so you wonder: was Arvind airily walking away after leaving a tip, or was he just sheepish — as many of us are — about hanging around to collect a small amount?
Either way, I think of the scene often. There was a time when, if someone was delivering food to my door and the bill came to, say, ₹490, I would hand over a ₹500 note and mutter “Rehne deejiye” if the man started to look in his pocket for change. After watching the film, if I find myself in the same situation, I will make sure to hand over another ₹30 or ₹40 so the tip seems more substantial. And it isn’t just heightened sensitivity, it’s also because a part of me thinks this will reduce my chances of being mocked: the delivery man might not joke about me with his friends; the status quo between us will remain.
Middle-class fantasies
If Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan was part of what became known as the parallel movement or the cinema of struggle, a very different treatment of the lack-of-privilege theme can be seen in the gentle comedy-romances from the so-called Middle Cinema. Take a scene from Basu Chatterjee’s Chhoti si Baat, an archetype of the cosy ‘middle-class film’. The diffident Arun (Amol Palekar) can barely bring himself to speak to the girl he likes (Prabha, played by Vidya Sinha), but then he goes to a hall and watches a film where a mainstream hero has no such confidence issues. As the brawny Dharmendra sings ‘Jaaneman jaaneman’ to Hema Malini, Arun imagines himself and Prabha in their place on the screen, and there is even a marvellous moment where the transition from the big movie stars to the everymen is briefly left incomplete — so that we see Dharmendra crooning to Vidya Sinha for a few seconds. Two universes have brushed against each other.
The Middle Cinema often shows us what form fantasy can take in ordinary lives and everyday contexts (another such scene that comes to mind is Palekar imagining himself as a big star while a jobless Amitabh Bachchan languishes outside a studio in Gol Maal) — and while this is often presented as fun and games, it is also a view of the underdog lording it over the pampered poodle. Imagination does have its limits, though: the shirt Palekar wears in the ‘Jaaneman’ fantasy sequence appears two sizes too big, as if it had been fitted for Dharmendra’s muscular chest.

The Sun brings out a fresh batch of sunspots,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-sun-brings-out-a-fresh-batch-of-sunspots/article31010533.ece,"Sun spots are relatively cooler spots on the Sun’s surface. Their number waxes and wanes in cycles that last 11 years approximately. We are currently at the minimum of one such cycle. Amidst claims that the Sun would “go silent” and not give out sunspots for an extended period, a group from IISER Kolkata has shown that the next sunspot cycle has begun and the Sun has indeed spoken. Their results were published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.
From our safe distance of about 148 million km, the Sun appears to be sedate and constant. However, huge solar flares and coronal mass ejections spew material from its surface into outer space. They originate from sunspots, an important phenomenon that people have been following for hundreds of years.
Sunspots occur in pairs, with a leader and a follower. They originate deep within the Sun and become visible when they pop out. Their number is not constant but shows a minimum and then rises up to a maximum and then falls again in what is called the solar cycle. So far, astronomers have documented 24 such cycles, the last one ended in 2019. 
Following a weakening trend in activity over the last few cycles, there were predictions that the Sun would go silent into a grand minimum in activity, with the disappearance of cycles. However, a team from IISER Kolkata has shown that there are signs that cycle 25 has just begun. They used the data from the instrument Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard NASA’s space-based Solar Dynamics Observatory for their calculations. 
“There has been a lot of controversy about solar cycle 25 stemming from observations of a weakening trend in solar activity over the past three sunspot cycles. This has led to speculation that the solar cycle is about to die and we are going to enter a grand minimum in solar activity lasting many decades. Some groups have claimed that this would give rise to a mini ice age and cooling of global climate,” says Dibyendu Nandi of IISER Kolkata who led the effort. “Our findings indicate that sunspot cycle 25 fields have already started appearing, implying that we are going to have a solar cycle. Speculation and predictions of a grand minimum are unfounded.”
Why is this so important to us on earth? After all the sunspots look small and are hardly even visible to us. Contrary to this, sunspot activity may be correlated with climate on earth. In the period between 1645 and 1715, sun spot activity had come to a halt on the Sun – a phenomenon referred to as the Maunder minimum. This coincided with extremely cold weather globally. So sunspots may have a relevance to climate on earth. Such links are tenuous, but definitely solar activity affects space weather, which can have an impact on space-based satellites, GPS, power grids and so on. 
Given the high temperatures in the Sun, matter exists there in the form of plasma, where the electrons are stripped away from the nuclei. The Sun is made of hot ionised plasma whose motions generate magnetic fields in the solar interior by harnessing the energy of the plasma flows. This mechanism is known as the solar dynamo mechanism (or magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism). “Simply stated, it is a process by which kinetic energy of plasma motions is converted to magnetic energy, which generates the magnetised sunspots, giving rise to the solar cycle,” explains Prof. Nandi. 
Because of the nature of the solar dynamo, the part of its magnetic field that gives rise to sunspots reverses direction when it moves from one solar cycle to another. This can be inferred by observing when the relative orientation of the sunspot pairs flip. Studying 74 such pairs of magnetic regions, the researchers find that in 41 the orientation corresponds to cycle 24, and in 33 the orientation corresponds to cycle 25. Thus they conclude that the Sunspot cycle 25 is brewing within the solar interior. 
 “Small magnetic regions and a few full grown sunspots with the magnetic polarity orientation that is expected of sunspot cycle 25 have already started appearing on the solar surface. This means that we have either already seen the start of sunspot cycle 25 or it is just about to start,” says Prof. Nandi. ",science
"Finally, India shares two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/finally-india-shares-two-sars-cov-2-genome-sequences/article31010520.ece,"India has finally shared two whole genome sequence data of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). 
The two sequences were shared by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology. This news comes after The Hindu reported on March 4 that India has not shared any genome sequence data with the GISAID. 
“We shared the two sequences with GISAID on March 5 evening,” said Priya Abraham, Director of NIV. “We had shared the sequences with GenBank [a public database] about two weeks ago.” However, the GenBank website mentions that whole genome sequences of two oronasopharynx (mouth, nose, throat) samples collected on January 27 and January 31 from two COVID-19 patients in Kerala were deposited in GenBank only on March 6. 
The accession number of the two sequences is MT012098 (collected on January 27) and MT050493 (collected on January 31).
The two sequences were shared by Varsha Potdar and others from NIV. Dr. Potdar heads the Influenza Group and her “major interest is molecular epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory viruses”.
In a tweet on March 6 evening, Newstrain said it has “updated” the database with “two SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Kerala sampled at the end of January”. It added: “These sequences do not link very closely to other sequences in the tree.” 
The three adults in Kerala who were found to be infected with the novel virus had returned from Wuhan. The first COVID-19 patient in India, a medical student who had returned from Wuhan, was laboratory confirmed by NIV on January 30. Two more adults from Kerala were laboratory confirmed by NIV within a couple of days.
At this point, it is not clear why the sequences appear to differ from the rest in the phylogenetic tree. A virologist who did not want to be named said that it could possibly be due to sequencing errors.
“NIV should rule out sequencing errors or contact Chinese CDC to find out if these sequences are linked to other sequences in Wuhan and not deposited in GISAID,” says Shahid Jameel, CEO of the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.
Referring to the Indian genome sequences not closely linked to other sequences in the tree, Dr Chitra Pattabiraman from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru says: “There are at least two possibilities — sequences could reflect the variations of the virus in China or they could be errors in sequencing, which can be corrected over time. The former is more likely and this can be resolved by adding more sequences.”
Studying viral genome sequences immensely helps in epidemiological investigations. “Sequencing the genome of novel coronavirus will help us to know where the virus came from and how the virus has spread. For instance, by sequencing the genome of the virus isolated from an Indian patient, it will become possible to know if the virus had come from China or any other country,” Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, Sonepat, Haryana, and the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences had earlier told The Hindu.
So far, 26 countries, including India, have shared 178 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with the GISAID. At 70, China has shared the highest number of sequences. 
The other countries that have shared higher number of sequences are the U.S. (22), Australia and Japan (10 each), and Singapore and South Korea (eight each). Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia have also shared one sequence each. ",science
Imposing travel restrictions alone has ‘modest’ effect on virus spread ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/imposing-travel-restrictions-alone-has-modest-effect-on-virus-spread/article31010490.ece,"Travel restrictions in areas that have been affected by novel coronavirus can only modestly reduce the spread of the outbreak, a new modelling study published in Science finds.
The spread of the virus can be reduced by cutting the transmission chain. This can be achieved through early detection and isolation of people found infected with the virus as well as by bringing about behavioural changes and raising awareness level in the community.
Even “sustained” restrictions on travel to and from mainland China by as much as 90% only can only “modestly affect the epidemic trajectory” unless combined with a 50% or higher cut in transmission in the community, the study found.
Shutting down Wuhan and imposing travel ban in the city on January 23 delayed the epidemic from spreading to other parts of mainland China by just three to five days. 
Even when travel restrictions are as high as 90%, the epidemic in mainland China is delayed for no more than two weeks if concomitant steps to reduce virus transmissibility are not taken, the authors found.
One of the reasons is that by January 23 when travel ban was introduced in Wuhan, the virus had already spread to other parts of mainland China.
Travel restrictions to China introduced by several countries, including the U.S., and a reduction or suspension of flight to China by 59 airline companies have not achieved extraordinary results in reducing the spread of the virus outside China, the study finds.
There was an initial 10-fold reduction in the number of imported cases when travel restrictions from China were introduced. But according to the model, by March 1, the number of imported cases per day shot up to 170 and 35 for 40% and 90% travel restrictions, respectively.
The number of cases outside mainland China will “resume its growth” after two-three weeks from cases that had their origin elsewhere, the model suggests.
 The reason: despite the travel restrictions to and from mainland China, a large number of people who were already infected by the virus have been travelling across national borders without being detected.
Of the several imported cases, a couple of cases could be “seeding multiple outbreaks” across the world, thus leading to an expansion of the epidemic. This was observed in the case of Iran, South Korea and Italy after mid-February. 
“The concurrent presence of both travel and transmissibility reductions, however, produce a much larger synergistic effect visible by both delaying the epidemic activity in Mainland China and the number of internationally imported cases,” the authors write.
“Moving forward we expect that travel restrictions to COVID-19 affected areas will have modest effects, and that transmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic,” they note. ",science
"How wounded plants heal, survive ",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-wounded-plants-heal-survive/article31010471.ece,"It’s hard life being a plant! From pathogens and herbivores to unfavourable weather, they are constantly injured or wounded and their sessile lifestyle only adds to the trouble. Despite all this, they heal and survive. How did they evolve such a great repair mechanism? What are the molecules and proteins aiding it? These were some of the questions an international team of researchers set out to answer and have now found some interesting mechanisms.

A paper recently published in Development shows that a protein named PLETHORA (PLT), which encodes stem cell promoting factors, helps in the regeneration of the vascular system at the site of injury. This protein binds to and activates the expression of another gene (CUC2). These two together increase the production of a plant growth hormone called auxin at the wound site. The combination of these proteins and hormones gives the plant the ability to repair wounds.
The corresponding author of the paper Kalika Prasad explains that the work spanned nearly a decade to create the right set of injuries mimicking those that plants encounter throughout their life and then hunt for the plant proteins that help in this essential quick fix. He is from the School of Biology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research at Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-Tvm).







“Though it was known that plants communicate within their different parts and with other plants during injury, not much was known about how they handle the injury. Though we carried out the initial studies on the roadside mustard plant, we noticed similar results when tested the using rice PLT protein too,” he adds.
It was seen that the injury healed not just at the surface but the veins regenerated too. “There was proliferation of the epithelial cells to seal the wounds and also functional restoration of tissue cells. The vein regeneration is very essential as transport of food, hormone, water, happens through it and any disruption may further hinder the plant growth,” explains Dhanya Radhakrishnan, PhD scholar and first author of the paper from IISER-Tvm.
Another interesting find was that these two proteins did not play any role in the general development of vascular system but stepped into action only during its injury.
“We were able to set up a mathematical model that gave us guidance that as the size of the wound changes the nature of the repair changes. The numerical simulations showed that after a particular size injury, the plant will be unable to regenerate or heal,” adds Anil Shaji from the Department of Physics at IISER-Tvm. He is one of the authors of the papers and has set out to uncover the physical processes like the flow of hormones that are involved in this healing process.
“We are now trying to find out all the different genes and pathways involved in the healing process and also the cellular reprogramming events. To decode if the day–night conditions affect this process would also be interesting,” adds Anju P.S., a research scholar and one of the first authors of the paper from the institute. The researchers hope that in the future these genes can be produced in surplus to create plants that can withstand insect attack and other injuries.",science
Coronavirus | India shares two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/coronavirus-india-shares-two-sars-cov-2-genome-sequences/article31007227.ece,"India has finally shared two whole genome sequence data of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).
The two sequences were shared by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology. This news comes after The Hindu reported on March 4 that India has not shared any genome sequence data with the GISAID.

“We shared the two sequences with GISAID on March 5 evening,” said Priya Abraham, Director of NIV. “We had shared the sequences with GenBank about two weeks ago.”
However, the GenBank website clearly mentions that whole genome sequences of two oronasopharynx (mouth, nose, throat) samples collected on January 27 and 31 from two COVID-19 patients in Kerala were deposited in GenBank only on March 6 and not two weeks ago as the NIV Director claims.
The two sequences were shared by Dr. Varsha Potdar and others from NIV. Dr. Potdar heads the Influenza Group and her “major interest is molecular epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory viruses”.
In tweet on March 6 evening, GISAID said it has “updated” the database with “two SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Kerala sampled at the end of January”. It added: “These sequences do not link very closely to other sequences in the tree.”
The three adults in Kerala who were found to be infected with the novel virus had returned from Wuhan. The first COVID-19 patient in India, a medical student who had returned from Wuhan, was laboratory confirmed by NIV on January 30. Two more adults from Kerala were laboratory confirmed by NIV within a couple of days.

At this point, it is not clear why the sequences appear to differ from the rest in the phylogenetic tree. A virologist who did not want to be named said that it could possibly be due to sequencing errors.
“NIV should rule out sequencing errors or contact Chinese CDC to find out if these sequences are linked to other sequences in Wuhan and not deposited in GISAID,” says Dr Shahid Jameel, CEO of the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.
Referring to the Indian genome sequences not closely linked to other sequences in the tree, Dr Chitra Pattabiraman from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru says: “There are There are at least two possibilities — sequences could reflect the variations of the virus in China or they could be errors in sequencing, which can be corrected over time or resolved by adding more sequences.”
Studying viral genome sequences immensely help in epidemiological investigations. “Sequencing the genome of novel coronavirus will help us to know where the virus came from and how the virus has spread. For instance, by sequencing the genome of the virus isolated from an Indian patient, it will become possible to know if the virus had come from China or any other country,” Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, Sonepat, Haryana and the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences had earlier told The Hindu.
So far, 26 countries, including India, have shared 178 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with the GISAID. At 70, China has shared the highest number of sequences. The other countries that have shared higher number of sequences are the U.S. (22), Australia and Japan (10 each), and Singapore and South Korea (eight each). Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia have also shared one sequence each.",science

India is now building a terrific team: Charlesworth,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/india-is-now-building-a-terrific-team-charlesworth/article31016934.ece,"He was among the first high-profile foreign names to be associated with Indian hockey and even though Ric Charlesworth left on a bitter note, his association with the country and its hockey seems unbreakable. The former Australian coach believes the current Indian team is on par with the best in the world.
In the country to develop a high-level hockey academy in Chandigarh as consultant with Round Glass Sports, which has a football programme and is a part owner of I-League club Punjab FC, Charlesworth, in an exclusive interaction with The Hindu insisted that the biggest change in the Indian players was at a psychological level.
“I think the future of hockey is intimately involved with the future of Indian hockey and so I want to see India do well. There was a period when we couldn’t beat you and then there was a period when you couldn’t beat us. Now I think there is parity and that’s good for the competition,” he said.
“When I was here 10 years ago, I believed it was a 10-year job for India to climb back to the top. More than anything else, I think the Hockey India League (HIL) was the catalyst. It brought international players here, the locals played with and against them, and realised that the international players only had two arms and two legs just like everyone else. Psychologically, it was an important barrier to be broken for India,” he added.
Asked about the one thing that has changed in Indian hockey, Charlesworth said it was belief. “You were always technically good and physically too. I think it’s the psychological shift that has occurred which has been the crucial thing. There is more belief and they understand that they can compete at that level. India has always had fantastic players, now they are building a terrific team. I have seen that happen with your cricket teams too,” he said.
He added that the Australian influence on Indian hockey was part of knowledge-exchange that happens everywhere. “I think you learn from everybody, you take resources and get contributions. We did that, taking knowledge from people who left India after partition. All our coaches were from the sub-continent, perhaps you are simply seeing the reverse of it now,” he said.
Asked his prediction for the Tokyo Olympics, Charlesworth was non-committal. “For me, the ideal game would be an Australia-India final. I think both are capable of winning a medal but the Olympics can be capricious. When it will happen is a question now, so let’s see what happens,” he said.",other sports

“I had never fought against this girl before today and honestly, I was a bit scared. I had told my coaches about it before the bout. They instilled confidence in me and I could pull off a one-sided result.

Rani will next face the reigning world and Asian champion Li Qian of China, who has the top billing in this category. Qian had no trouble beating Mongolia’s Myagmarjargal Munkhbat 5-0 in the opening bout of the day.
Taking full advantage of her longer reach, Rani outpunched the inexperienced but determined Chutee. The Indian is a three-time Asian medallist, besides being a former bronze-winner at the 2014 Asian Games.
Krishan, however, had to slog hard against a brilliant boxer, whose performance was eye-catching despite the loss. Okazawa, a gold-winner at the Olympic Test Event last year, kept Krishan on his toes with his right jabs being particularly effective.
What worked for the Indian was the consistent straight punches to the body, which fetched him the bulk of the points.

"Not just computers, even your cars aren’t safe from hackers",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/not-just-computers-even-your-cars-arent-safe-from-hackers/article31010753.ece,"If you thought only your computers and cell phones were under threat from hackers, think again. A recent research has revealed that not even your cars are safe from cyber attacks.
A joint study was conducted by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium and the University of Birmingham in the U.K., the results were made public earlier this week. The research paper describes how electronic key-fobs, which are used to lock and unlock cars, can be hacked by cyber criminals with surprising ease, and millions of cars are at risk.
The key-fob, or immobiliser, enables the user of a vehicle to lock or unlock their car with the touch of a button. The system was invented to try and control car thefts, which are traditionally executed by bringing together certain wires in the ignition, known as “hot-wiring” a car, which starts the ignition without a key. The research paper points out vulnerabilities in the immobilisers of several models of Hyundai, Toyota and Kia.

RFID device
According to the report, all a hacker has to do is to use a radio frequency identification (RFID) device within close range of a key-fob, which exploits the vulnerability in the immobiliser system and downloads its secret code to the hacker’s device. Using this information, the hackers can clone the target’s key-fob, use it to unlock the car and drive away without raising any alarm whatsoever. The only challenge that remains after hacking the key-fob is to override the ignition, but car thieves had surpassed that hurdle way back when they invented hot-wiring.
The car models named in the research report include Auris, Camry, Corolla, FJ Cruiser, Fortuner, Hiace, Highlander, Hilux, Land Cruiser, RAV4, Urban Cruiser and Yaris by Toyota, and I-10, I-20, Veloster, IX20 and I-40 by Hyundai.
The report describes how the research team obtained a large number of electronic control units used in immobilisers of several cars and reverse-engineered their firmware — the permanent software programmed in devices — which enabled them to spot the vulnerabilities.

DoS attack
Apart from car thefts, the other possibility pointed out in the report is that of a denial of service (DoS) attack, where hackers can take over a large number of key-fobs and simply not let users unlock their vehicles. On a large enough scale, such an attack could be chaotic.
The report states, “Performing this type of DoS attack can be automated by building a device which repeatedly broadcasts the required commands. While there might be little incentive for someone to do this type of attack, it could lead to bad publicity for the affected car manufacturers and increased revenue for local garage owners.”

Which health insurance policy should I take? Answers to your personal finance queries,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ask-us/article31011116.ece,"
ANTRYAMI SINGH
A. Consider two aspects before zeroing in on the right policy to buy: the coverage you require and the service and response level of the insurer. You may want a high sum insured (SI), with special coverages like daily cash benefit and other value-added covers. Or you may want a no-frills policy with a sufficient SI. Based on what is on offer by various insurers you can shortlist them and make your final shortlist of policies.
For choosing the insurer, a company with whom you have experienced good service would be a good choice.
Equally important is the intermediary – the agent or broker who gives last mile service. Remember that service can be extraordinarily good when buying a policy. The test will be how they handle a claim.
A company with a high claims settlement ratio is better. You can even see how fast they settle claims through various statistics on the website of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI, www.irdai.gov.in). Track financial strength of companies which indicates their ability to pay claims. The solvency ratio should be at least 1.5. If not, though the regulations will protect policyholders, you may not want to shortlist them.
SRIPADA RAMARAO
A. Both policies are indemnity-based, which means that they will reimburse expenses against bills as per the terms of the policy. So, you can claim only to the extent of your expenses under one or the other policy, or proportionately if claiming from both.
Given that you have a built-in redundancy what you can do is as follows.
At renewal time with the insurance company, shift from a basic hospitalisation policy to a top-up or super top-up policy with the same insurer. That will give you an additional coverage and also keep your benefits like coverage of pre-existing conditions intact.
You should discuss with them and ensure your no-claim benefits are carried over into the new policy.
ASHISH KATHURIA
A. With an employer policy in place, if you purchase a basic hospitalisation policy from any insurer, one of the two policies will be redundant depending on their SIs. You can instead expand your coverage by purchasing a top-up or super top-up policy from an insurance company that will supplement your coverage with your employer. This policy should have a ‘threshold’ equal to the SI under your employer’s policy for the best efficiency.
If your employer’s policy does not cover your wife and daughter, please buy a basic hospitalisation policy for them with SI equal to the policy that covers you (from your employer) and you have the option still to take a top-up/ super top-up policy for the three of you. Remember the threshold limit of the top-up/ super top-up policy should be equal to the basic cover amount for best efficiency.

Mr. Kapoor’s arrest at the ED office in Ballard Estate followed over 20 hours of questioning by the central agency after it raided his residence on Friday night.
The arrest comes after charges of alleged financial irregularities and mismanagement in the operations of the private bank surfaced and the RBI and Union government initiated action to control its affairs.

Officials said Mr. Kapoor, 62, will be produced before a local court during the day to obtain custody.
The investigating officer of the case had recorded Mr. Kapoor’s statement under the PMLA when he was first interrogated on Friday night at his upscale residence in ‘Samudra Mahal’ complex in Worli area here.
He was brought to the ED office on Saturday noon for a fresh round of questioning.
On Saturday, the agency widened its probe in the case as the premises of Mr. Kapoor’s three daughters in Delhi and Mumbai were searched to gather more information and evidence.
Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?
According to officials, Mr. Kapoor’s wife Bindu and daughters — Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor and Radha Kapoor — are allegedly linked to some companies to which the suspected “proceeds of crime” have been traced.
The case against Mr. Kapoor is linked to the scam-hit DHFL as the loans lent by the bank to the company allegedly turned NPAs, they said.
A ₹600-crore worth loan extended by the DHFL to an entity is also at the centre of the ED probe, officials said.
The central agency is also probing Mr. Kapoor’s role in connection with the disbursal of loans to some corporate entities and the subsequent alleged kickbacks reportedly received in his wife’s accounts.
Other alleged irregularities are also under the agency’s scanner including the one related to the alleged PF fraud in the Uttar Pradesh power corporation, they added.
The CBI has recently taken over investigation into the ₹2,267-crore Employees’ Provident Fund fraud in Uttar Pradesh, where hard-earned savings of power sector employees were invested in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

Experts in the film insurance industry point out that when it comes to insurance, the Tamil film industry is still at a nascent stage. “Only a few big production houses in the Tamil industry are functioning like Bollywood when it comes to insurance but the point is that the ratio of insuring films versus the number of productions going on the floors is not very encouraging,” says Sumant Salian, Business Head, Alliance Insurance Brokers Private Limited.

Safety in the dream factory: ‘Indian 2’ gives a wake-up call to Tamil film industry 



 

Safety in the dream factory: ‘Indian 2’ gives a wake-up call to Tamil film industry 
According to Shreeraj Deshpande, Chief Operating Officer, Future Generali India Insurance, says, compared to the Mumbai film industry, which buys insurance that covers all aspects (package policy), the Tamil film industry is still catching up. “Initially, insurance was considered as one more burden on the film budget and the producers were very hesitant to take insurance policies. Now, with massive-budget Tamil movies coming up, they are open to opt for film insurance and even pay high premiums,” Mr. Deshpande points out.
The popular policy amongst film-makers in Tamil Nadu is one that covers the cancellation of shoots and injuries of the cast, which includes the main actors and directors and the crew members, and includes covers like damage to sets, public liability etc. Today, major Tamil movies feature a range of risky elements like motorcycle/ car stunts, fights and filming in foreign locations, hence insuring a film — especially a big-budget film — has become crucial.
“But the Tamil film industry very rarely gives importance to insurance for people, including stuntmen, cameramen, hospitality team, location managers, etc. There are policies which look into distributors’ loss of revenue, but this is not a hit among people in Kollywood,” said the managing director and CEO of another insurance firm who requested anonymity as he has signed a contract with producers.

Mr. Sumant explained that generally the film package insurance taken by the production house covers the entire crew, including light man and camera man, on an unnamed basis for accidental insurance. “The insurance rule book says if you are insuring your crew on an unnamed basis, the insured should declare the total number of crew members in attendance at any point of a given day so that there is no under-insurance or a no-insurance situation,” he said. “We have seen insurance policies where the number of people insured on an unnamed basis looks inadequate and also the value of insurance per person is low,” added Mr. Sumant.
Producers who spoke to The Hindu said that their biggest concern while making a film is the lead actor and his salary. Then comes the payment of the director. Unless it is a big budget film, producers said that they would not bet much on insurance.
“Making a film is not easy – from pre-production to post-production, it involves so many stakeholders. And, apart from the producers like me, there are other people who also invest their monies. So, taking insurance needs the nod of all these people,” said a producer, who has been in the industry for over two decades.

Some ideas to make your mutual fund investments tax-efficient ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/some-ideas-to-make-your-mf-investments-tax-efficient/article31011110.ece,"In our article dated February 10, 2020 (Budget aftermath: reap the dividends, don’t fret) we discussed that the growth option of mutual fund (MF) schemes is more tax efficient than the dividend option, more so after the Union Budget presented on February 1. Let’s discuss this in detail.
There are two types of funds from the tax perspective — equity and debt. Hybrid funds are classified either as equity or debt in this respect. If a fund has more than 65% in equities, it is classified as an equity fund and more than 65% in debt makes it a debt fund for tax purposes.
Let’s start with equity funds. In equity funds, growth option becomes long term from the tax perspective after a holding period of one year. The taxation rule says, on your gains from the growth option, you pay tax at 10% plus surcharge and cess as applicable on gains of more than ₹1 lakh per financial year. In other words, up to ₹1 lakh of long-term capital gains per year is free from tax; beyond that you pay 10% plus surcharge and cess on your gains.
There is a method of generating further tax efficiency within this rule. Even if you do not want to move out from an equity stock/equity MF, and if the price/NAV has moved up since your purchase, you can sell (i.e. book the gains) and repurchase the same share/MF Scheme.
How does it help? It helps by creating a higher acquisition cost for tax purposes when you finally exit the stock/scheme. For taxation of equity, January 31, 2018 is known as the ‘grandfathering date’ i.e. prices /NAVs prior to this date is to be ignored and this becomes the cost of acquisition for all future dates. Let’s say the price/NAV as on January 31, 2018 was ₹100 and you would eventually sell it after seven years when the price would be say ₹170. At that point of time, you would pay tax on ₹170 minus ₹100 = ₹70, provided the gain is more than ₹1 lakh in that financial year and tax laws remain same as on today. Currently, two years have passed from January 31, 2018 and price/NAV has moved up to say ₹120 as on February 2020.
Today, if you sell the share / MF scheme at ₹120 and purchase it again, as long as the gains e.g. ₹120 minus ₹100 = ₹20 is within ₹1 lakh, it is tax free for you. How it helps you is, through this transaction, your cost of acquisition moves from ₹100 to ₹120, which will be relevant when you eventually sell it after another five years at ₹170. At that point of time, your gains will be ₹170 minus ₹120 = ₹50 instead of ₹170 minus ₹100 = ₹70.
To give another perspective to the same idea, let’s say you invested ₹10 lakh in equity MFs at an earlier date (more than one year ago) and the portfolio value as of today is say ₹10,99,000. You can redeem the entire portfolio as the gains are within ₹1 lakh in the financial year.
Since equity investments are long term, you invest again in the same funds and create a higher acquisition cost. If the market value of the portfolio today is say ₹11,50,000, then for executing this strategy, you have to sell as much as your gains are within ₹1 lakh in the financial year, to avoid paying tax. In the dividend option of MF Schemes, as and when the Union Budget proposals are passed and becomes applicable from April 1, 2020, you have to pay tax on dividends at your marginal slab rate, which for most investors is 30% plus surcharge and cess. In the growth option, as long as you hold it for one year and it becomes long term for tax purposes, you either pay tax at 10% or if the gains are less than ₹1 lakh, it becomes free of tax.
Now, let’s discuss the final piece on taxation of your equity MF investments. The illustrations above assume that you invested in the fund lump sum i.e. on a particular date and exited lump sum on a particular date. In reality, you may invest in a fund over multiple dates e.g. through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and may withdraw over multiple dates e.g. through a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP). In such a scenario, to match against the exit, the NAV of your earliest investment in the fund will be taken.
The jargon for this is First- In-First-Out (FIFO). As an example, if you did a SIP in a fund from January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2019 and exit today, the acquisition NAV as on January 1, 2018 will be relevant for tax purposes i.e. today’s NAV minus that on January 1, 2018 is your gain. If you do an SWP from January 1, 2020 onwards, the first i.e. earliest investment will be considered for taxation, for every exit.

Three essential ingredients to a child’s education plan ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/three-essential-ingredients-to-a-childs-education-plan/article31011098.ece,"Building up a tidy sum towards children’s education is the top financial aspiration for most Indian parents and often takes precedence over every other goal. 
Aware that an early start makes all the difference, many parents today are prepared to invest towards this right from the toddler stage.
But an early start will be of little use if you end up investing in the wrong class of products, based on emotional sales pitches that help line the pockets of product sellers more than investors. Here are some of the essential ingredients to building a healthy corpus for your child’s education.
In India, the demand for quality education far outpaces the supply of seats offered by top-tier institutions. This mismatch, and the government’s efforts to make public education institutions more self-sustaining, has resulted in the cost of higher education galloping at a higher pace than the general inflation rate. Official data tells us that the CPI index for education increased at about 6% annually in the last eight years, but fees at the sought-after colleges have risen much faster.
In the IITs, for example, the total cost of a four-year B-Tech course adds up to ₹8-10 lakh today, a fourfold increase from about ₹2 lakh in 2012. The course fee at the top three IIMs is about ₹21-22 lakh against ₹13-15 lakh in 2012. 
The cost of putting your child through private colleges is significantly higher. BITS Pilani levies ₹20-24 lakh for a four-year B Tech degree. The cost of a BA (Hons), BSc (Hons) at the Ashoka University is close to ₹28 lakh. 
So, while the current cost of a graduate plus post-graduate degree at premier institutions is about ₹30-40 lakh, you need to budget for inflation in these costs over the next 10-20 years to decide on your target corpus. 
Many online calculators help you figure out this target corpus. While using them, be sure to use inflation assumptions of 8-10%, rather than the default numbers of 5-6% to get to a realistic figure. For instance, at 8% inflation, ₹30 lakh in today’s prices will be about ₹95 lakh in 15 years’ time.
Many folks investing for their child’s education like to stick with safe debt options such as traditional insurance plans or post office schemes for this goal because they offer capital safety. But safety is usually accompanied by modest returns, so doing this can result in your child’s education corpus falling well short of target with inflation over time. Traditional ‘child’ insurance plans offer just 5-6% annual returns. Returns from post office schemes such as the NSC/PPF and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana are healthier at 7.9% and 8.4% respectively. But even these may barely match inflation in education costs. This makes a sizeable equity component essential to get to your child’s education goal.
The higher return potential of equities also reduce the amount of savings you will need to set aside towards your child’s education. At an 8% return, to get to ₹95 lakh in 15 years’ time in the above example, you will need to invest roughly ₹27,500 a month. But at a 11% return, the monthly investment reduces to about ₹21,000.
But equities need a long runway to deliver decent returns and can wreak havoc with your capital for horizons less than 5-7 years. So, to ensure that equity bets pay off, you need to make an early start on your child’s education investments, ideally starting when he/she is 3-5 years old.
If you have your heart set on a foreign college degree for your child in the western world, you can budget for lower inflation in college fees, at 3-4% a year. But one factor that can throw your plans off kilter is the rupee depreciating against foreign currencies. The rupee has typically depreciated by 3-4% annually against the dollar in the last decade. Investing a portion of your child’s education portfolio (say 10-15%) in mutual funds that invest in U.S.-listed stocks can help you gain from the rupee depreciation and hedge this risk.
Financial product sellers in India are well aware that children’s education is an emotional issue for parents. They promote a wide range of ‘special child plans’ that are long on slick packaging and short on benefits. So, before investing in a ‘child plan,’ the first question to ask is if a plain-vanilla product will not do better for your child’s education.
Here are some specific red flags to avoid. Child endowment and money-back plans from insurers with a return guarantee usually offer very low returns to make up for the safety. They are avoidable as they may fail to keep up with inflation. Many of these plans, strangely enough, bundle in a life cover for your child. What you need, instead, is an adequate term insurance cover for yourself and other breadwinners in your family, so that your child’s education needs are met even if you aren’t around.
Mutual funds schemes that are specially designated as ‘child plans’ often carry five-year lock-ins and exit loads which prevent you from switching out in the event of the fund lagging its peers. Plain, aggressive hybrid funds or multi-cap equity funds make for a far better choice, offering the same return potential with greater flexibility. Overall, a combination of post office schemes such as NSC/PPF and SIPs in two to three multi-cap equity funds and a generous term insurance cover for the breadwinners , are the essential ingredients to make the dreams for your child come true.",economy
What does the Supreme Court order reinstating virtual currency activities mean? ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/what-does-the-supreme-court-order-reinstating-virtual-currency-activities-mean/article31010937.ece,"The story so far: On Wednesday, March 4, a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India struck down a 2018 circular of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which sought to prevent banks and institutions from dealing in “virtual currencies” — also referred to as cryptocurrencies, an example being Bitcoin — and providing services to those engaged in trading in such currencies. The Court order comes seven months after an inter-ministerial committee recommended that cryptocurrencies be banned, proposing instead that an official digital currency be launched in the country.
It has its origins in the writ petitions filed by the industry body, the Internet and Mobile Association of India, and several crypto exchanges, their shareholders, and traders. They challenged the RBI circular on many counts. Through that circular, the RBI had forbidden banks from extending a range of services to facilitate individuals and entities in dealing with cryptocurrencies. The list of such services included “maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer/receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/sale of VCs [or virtual currencies].”
The petitioners gave instances of virtual currency exchanges shutting down as a result of this circular. There was also a mention of how money lying in the account of one of the exchanges got frozen. The petitioners questioned the RBI’s power in prohibiting trading in virtual currencies; they wondered how the RBI could propose an outright ban when all other stakeholders such as the Department of Economic Affairs, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Central Board of Direct Taxes, among others, had batted for a regulatory regime; they also challenged the circular on the grounds of lack of proportionality (the idea that regulatory action shouldn’t be disproportionate to the goals such action seeks to achieve).
Also read | Supreme Court order on cryptocurrency will offer only temporary relief
This can be understood by how the RBI defined virtual currencies in 2013, which the Court said was perhaps the first time it took note of “technology risks in changing business environment”. The RBI defined such currency, the Court order notes, “as a type of unregulated digital money, issued and controlled by its developers and used and accepted by the members of a specific virtual community”. The absence of a centralised authority running it, seen as a plus by those who back cryptocurrencies, is viewed as a drawback by official monetary systems. There are other factors too. The value of such currencies has been driven purely by speculative impulses, and they have had a volatile journey all along. The anonymity that the system ensures has also been misused in the past, with cryptocurrencies said to enable funding of terrorist operations. There is also fear that it could undermine the monetary system and render policies ineffective. And all these fears are shared by the global financial system.
Justices Rohinton Nariman, Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian set aside the RBI circular of 2018, saying, “It is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate.” Their reasoning was based on the fact that the RBI had not found that the activities of virtual currency exchanges had adversely affected the entities it regulated. This, even as virtual currencies have not been banned in the country. “But the trading in VCs and the functioning of VC exchanges are sent to comatose by the impugned circular by disconnecting their lifeline namely, the interface with the regular banking sector,” the order said.
But while doing so, they have indicated quite strongly that the central bank has the requisite power to regulate or prohibit virtual currencies. They have noted that: “Anything that may pose a threat to or have an impact on the financial system of the country, can be regulated or prohibited by RBI, despite the said activity not forming part of the credit system or payment system.”
Quite likely. The inter-Ministerial committee had recommended an outright ban on crypto currencies. A draft law was also put in place. This verdict may not have changed the direction in which our policymakers want to go with respect to cryptocurrencies. The Economic Times has reported that the RBI is planning to file a review petition in the Supreme Court.",economy
Lettuce grown in space as nutritious as ones on Earth: NASA ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lettuce-grown-in-space-as-nutritious-as-ones-on-earth-nasa/article31014394.ece," Researchers have found that the salad crop, red romaine lettuce, grown on board the International Space Station (ISS), is as nutritious as counterparts grown on the Earth, an advance that may help astronauts grow safe, fresh food during space missions.
 According to the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, the space-grown lettuce is free of disease-causing microbes and safe to eat, and is at least as nutritious as the Earth-grown plants. 
 The researchers, including Christina Khodadad from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in the U.S., said that the lettuce is nutritious despite being grown under lower gravity and more intense radiation than on the Earth.
 Traditionally, astronauts in space live on processed, pre-packaged space rations such as fruits, nuts, chocolate, shrimp cocktails, peanut butter, chicken, and beef to name a few, they said. 
 Apart from a welcome diet change, the researchers said, the fresh produce may provide astronauts with additional potassium as well as vitamins K, B1, and C – nutrients that are less abundant in pre-packaged rations, and degrade during long-term storage.
Ms. Khodadad and her team believe that growing crops on board may be especially useful on long-distance space missions such as the upcoming Artemis-III missions, scheduled to land humans on the lunar South pole by 2024, and NASA’s first crewed mission to Mars, planned for the late 2020s.
“The ability to grow food in a sustainable system that is safe for crew consumption will become critical as NASA moves toward longer missions. Salad-type, leafy greens can be grown and consumed fresh with few resources,” Ms. Khodadad said.
The study noted that between 2014 and 2016, lettuce was grown on board the ISS from surface-sterilised seeds within Vegetable Production Systems, nicknamed “Veggie” – growth chambers equipped with LED lighting and a watering system, specifically designed to grow crops in space. 
 It said the crops grew undisturbed inside the Veggie units for 33 to 56 days, until crew members ate part of the mature leaves without any negative health effects. 
 The scientists said the remainder of the crops was deep-frozen until transport back to the Earth for chemical and biological analysis.
 As a control, the researchers also grew plants on the Earth under the same conditions – possible because temperature, carbon dioxide, and humidity data were logged on board the ISS, and replicated in labs with a 24 to 48 hour delay.
 They said the space-grown lettuce was similar in composition to the Earth-based controls. 
The study noted that in some trials, the space-grown plants tended to be richer in elements like potassium, sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, and zinc, as well as in some molecules with proven antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activity. 
 It said both varieties of lettuce also had similar levels of anthocyanin, and other antioxidants – molecules in food which can protect cells from damage by highly reactive natural chemicals present in the body.
 When the scientists assessed the microbes growing on the lettuce varieties, they found that the typical Earth-grown plants harboured a diverse set of microbes with specialised, beneficial bacteria, and those that neither harm nor benefit their host.
 They said these microbes can affect the health of plants and their suitability as food. 
 Using DNA sequencing technology, the researchers then characterised the communities of fungi and bacteria growing on the lettuce, and identified the 15 most abundant microbial genera on the leaves and 20 in the roots. 
The findings revealed that the diversity and identity of these microbes were similar for space- and Earth-grown lettuce. 
 None of the detected bacteria genera are known to cause disease in humans, the scientists said. 
 They said the leaves never carried any dangerous bacteria known to occasionally contaminate crops, such as E. coli, Salmonella, and S. aureus, adding that the fungal and mould spores on them were also in the range fit for human consumption.
 According to the study, the lettuce grown in the Veggie units is safe to eat, opening the door for experiments with other nutritious and tasty crops onboard the space station that may help astronauts journey further into space.
“The International Space Station is serving as a test bed for future long-duration missions, and these types of crop growth tests are helping to expand the suite of candidates that can be effectively grown in microgravity,” said study co-author Gioia Massa, a project scientist at the Kennedy Space Center.
“Future tests will study other types of leafy crops as well as small fruits like pepper and tomatoes, to help provide supplemental fresh produce for the astronaut diet,” Ms. Massa added. ",science
"How the entertainment industry, education models and taboos around crypto could change, post-SC ruling ",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-more-people-will-be-curious-about-crypto-economics-in-india-post-sc-ruling/article31023663.ece,"Akshay Aggarwal had been waiting with bated breath to hear the verdict of the Supreme Court regarding crypto-currency, an encrypted, decentralised and digital medium of exchange. As the founder of Blockchained India, a pan-India community for crypto enthusiasts, this ruling means the most to him in terms of freedom of investment and of movement.
Finally, a verdict was made last Wednesday: ‘SC rules curb on crypto-currency trade illegal’, and thus the ban on trading in virtual currency, crypto-currency and Bitcoins was lifted. Judging from the excitement on social media and relevant online forums, it was as though a cataclysmic election win took place. Plus, with the ongoing Yes Bank crisis, some crypto-lovers such as Rohan Jethi simply tweeted, “Short banks. Long Bitcoin.”
India’s pro-crypto community is five million-plus strong, and interestingly, despite our population and online presence, India only accounted for around three percent of the global crypto-currency market before the ban. Surely, these figures could grow slowly as more currencies are created and more progressive discussions are held.
An excited Akshay admits he was quite nervous in the lead-up to the verdict. “I had a slight positivity though there was still disappointment in the regulators that penalised innovators because of their own narrow thought process.”
Shinam Arora, who heads Pune-based Primechain Technologies, which facilitates self-building blockchain ecosystems, says, “I don’t understand why RBI couldn’t come up with a way earlier to monetise it. If they would have monetised it, it would have helped in our country’s growth and economy so much by now. For example, they could have simply imposed a minimal charge towards cryptocurrency exchange.”

The umbrella of this technology is so vast that it is just impossible to enumerate the different sub-markets... almost like the fight club of banking, as in it exists but not many talk about it.
Shinam points out that India is a potential investment epicentre for the world too; many global crypto-currency companies will be looking forward for expanding their business in India.
Crypto has its own exchange market like mainstream currency would, too. Akshay predicts the acceleration of crypto-neo-banks (a type of direct bank) which would speed things along, “I see sophistication and maturity coming in this industry,” comments Akshay, “mainly because of increased demand, which will lead to increased competition. I am expecting a hundred more exchanges to open up in the next two years.” 
The entertainment scene could change too. myNK, India’s first blockchain-powered global entertainment platform, foresees positivity. Founder Nitin Narkhede says, “The entertainment industry will be one of the early adopters of crypto. Crypto adoption can streamline many processes in film and music industries, create new financing options and improve payment models in the industry, thereby benefiting many smaller artistes and stakeholders. New payment mechanisms will find their way in the existing systems and new companies will emerge to cater to these requirements.” He elaborates that myNK will benefit in a big way because the platform “deals with international distributors and can now open options to accept and make payments in real-time using crypto besides other channels that we can now open to build a crypto-enabled entertainment ecosystem.”
The gaming industry also sees a lot of interaction with crypto. Up until about two years ago, gaming platform Steam operated many transactions through such means but put a stop to it because of its ineffectiveness, and this could change given the massive Indian population on Steam.
What of education; do experts see a potential for schools and colleges to at least inform students about crypto-currency? Wilson Bright, who heads Bengaluru-based BlockSurvey, explains, “I think it would be wonderful to inform young people about the entirety of the banking ecosystem and state that there are alternatives! There is also the myth that to invest in Bitcoin, for example, you have to own one whole Bitcoin, so BlockSurvey hopes to inform and educate people about the value of owning your own transactional freedom and being proud of it. So this is the time to really get the conversation going because people will now be curious, so the first step is to get rid of misinformation.”

Shinam agrees with Wilson adding, “I know of lot of people who have invested money in cryptocurrency without understanding it. They don’t know how this system works and that’s why they fall prey to fraudsters; so awareness and understanding is very important if you want to trade in virtual currencies.”
However optimistic things look, such startups must be patient when it comes to acquiring funding after a barren time. While the situation is clearer de justo, the same might not be de facto; there are many mindsets to converse with. Akshay says, “Now in this extreme economic vulnerability, I don’t think much is going to change with this one early positive indicator. This will definitely restore faith and bring confidence to Indian crypto-entrepreneurs; maybe early adoption results could even convince some investors to take bets on them.”
Though the battle is won, the war is far from over. “Post SC ruling, if the review petition doesn’t yield a negative result again, we shall push forward our goals of enabling mass adoption towards mobilising support from politicians,” avers Akshay, “I see a lack of futuristic thinking towards use of technology generally, and I believe we need to identify or elect pro-tech champions to push positive regulations. We need to continually direct these debates to the right problem, that being of prohibiting only the negative use.”",technology
‘The Division 2: Warlords of New York’ review: a fun experience with new enhancements,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-division-2-warlords-of-new-york-review-fun-experience-new-enhancements/article31023245.ece,"The more I played The Division 2, the more it made me miss the first game. In many ways, New York was the definitive setting for the game. The Division 2 could have continued in New York instead of the less-exciting Washington DC. With the new Warlords of New York expansion to The Division 2, the setting thankfully switches back to New York, complete with the Christmas decorations.
The world of The Division, which features a pandemic that spread along the backs of dollar bills, feels very in line with the news today. The game brings a new biological virus threat into the equation, and the return of Aaron Keener, the antagonist of the previous game. A rogue Division Agent, who along with his four horsemen, is set to bring about a reckoning in Lower Manhattan.
Tom Clancy’s The Division 2: Warlords of New YorkDeveloper: Massive EntertainmentPublisher: UbisoftPrice: ₹700 onwards for the standalone expansion.Availability: All platforms.
Warlords looks every bit as impressive as its predecessor. Streets are claustrophobic with realistic debris piled high, brimming with abandoned cars, giant broken Christmas ornaments, all telling a story of a better time. The agents themselves look detailed, reflecting the guns, skills and armour that you select, while the enemies are varied with distinctive markings for each type. The best part? The guns in the game are well-implemented, from hip-fire to aim-use, and you will actually feel like John Wick.
New York is a little different this time around. Lower Manhattan is still reeling from a hurricane, resulting in some impressive scenes of urban decay and disarray. For those who are fairly new, the game bumps you up to Level 30 for the expansion. The gameplay largely remains the same, with Warlords being more of a single-player jaunt. To draw out Keener, you have to take down his warlords — you do that by freeing their territories. Standard Division slash Ubisoft grind tactics. Though, it’s a lot more fun than Division 2.

Apart from the action, Division is about the maths. When you shoot people, you see numbers pop out. These numbers are governed by more numbers. One look at the inventory screen is a gaggle of figures and statistics that make up your damage and defence attributes. These, thankfully, have been streamlined to show you the numbers that matter, with gear roll ranges along with handy icons. It does look overwhelming but, overall, accessible.
Along with this expansion, also come a lot of enhancements. The most important is the post-endgame SHD level system, which enables you to keep playing through various Division 2 seasons. You can amp up your ‘skill tier’ upto 6 by strategically acquiring weapons and other equipment. If you are at tier 6, then the effectiveness of your selected skill increases by upto 60%.

The Dark Zones have been streamlined, which is the best part of The Division games. Agents go into a highly infected zone filled with powerful enemies, other agents, and a whole lot of loot that you have to extract via a helicopter dispatch. Anything goes here. You never know when an agent, who you thought was your ally, will go rogue to steal your hard-earned loot. You can choose to go rogue if you want, but you would be marked for a manhunt.
Ubisoft has understood the risks in Dark Zones and have upped the quality of loot with each excursion.
While there is still more of the same going on in the new edition of the game, being back in New York was a fun experience, even if it was for a short time. The enhancements are welcome, especially the skill tiers, making Washington DC a bit less boring.

Chennai Central takes on its younger ‘sibling’ Egmore Station ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/harbingers-of-home/article31023925.ece,"A sepia-toned picture of a clocktower along the banks of Buckingham Canal is the first image that crosses your mind, when somebody utters the golden word: Madras. It is the place that receives every traveller with open arms, irrespective of geographical boundaries. Where Mani Ratnam’s characters roam, fostering cutesy romances. This is Chennai Central — yes, we are old-fashioned and still swear by that name.
Madras Central, as it was known, came into existence in 1873. You do realise that we are talking about 147 years of history, right? Where do we begin? Of course, it is an architectural marvel that is both Gothic and Romanesque. 
Designed by George Harding, it is spread across 17 platforms with over 19 trains operating on average. A news report in 2012 stated that the station plays house to over 180,000 passengers at any given point of time. It might not be the cleanest railway station in the country (we are working on it), but sure boasts excellent connectivity and hassle-free services. Let us take cinema, for instance. Every filmmaker tends to romanticise Chennai Central, which, sadly, isn’t the case with its ‘underdog’ sibling. Yes, there have been movies that manifested fake hopes about train rides (courtesy: Gautham Menon). My journeys, for one, are filled with tales of desperation to meet a Jessie or Meghna. But the key is to not get carried away by cinema.
There is more to Chennai Central than its rich legacy and colourful history. It is that sheer joy of crossing the Basin Bridge Station, expectedly peeping through the window only to be received by a signboard that reads: Chennai Central. It is an experience every Madras-bred would relate to.
Srivatsan S no longer bothers to check the chart sheet and is convinced that his co-passengers are a couple in their 50s
It isn’t easy being the younger sibling, but that’s how Egmore has always been treated, in comparison to the Central railway station. Filmmakers go overboard shoving that old clocktower in your face, trying to wring out emotion for ‘Madras’. However, our Egmore has been quietly and efficiently ferrying millions of passengers every year since 1908, when it sprung to life to supplement Central.
Designed by Sir Henry Irwin, this red and white neo-classical structure with its long corridors and clocktower is one of the city’s younger icons. As Chennai’s spoken history goes, it was made out of a British fort that was possibly used to store ammunition. It is iconic in more than one way: until 2004, this station hosted the world’s only meter-gauge suburban train.
Its 11 platforms are where trains bound Southwards, like to Trichy, meet ones bound Northwards, to Hyderabad and Mumbai. According to a 2008 The Hindu report, along these tracks are hollow vertical columns, that were engineered to collect rainwater which was made to flow into a tank. That’s the Egmore style: efficient with no frills or fancies.
For my first four years in Chennai, going to Egmore meant taking one step closer to home, which back then was Mumbai. 
To this day, when I find myself at the station commuting for work, I pass by the Dadar-Chennai Egmore Express and can’t help but daydream... what if I bought a ticket and jumped in?
Yes, Egmore may not have Central’s vastness or get the adulation from filmmakers and regular maintenance from the Government that Central does. But that’s what happens when you ignore the younger sibling, and make your firstborn your main project (Mom!)

Three penalties women in the corporate world face for having wombs ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-motherhood-penalties-women-in-the-corporate-world-face/article31023490.ece,"Roshan Rajpal tells the story of a woman who came in for an interview at the Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli. A profile check revealed that she was also interviewing at other places. When Roshan asked her about this, the woman revealed that since she had been married two years employers did not want to ‘risk’ giving her a job lest she get pregnant. “She said that as a woman interviewer only I had not asked her this gendered question,” Roshan says.
Today, Roshan herself is a general manager, one of the few in the industry. As someone who began her career at 19 with Holiday Inn and quit at 25 due to family pressure following childbirth, she understands how hard it is for women to both battle and juggle society’s expectations, their family’s — sometimes unspoken but often palpable — demands, their own wants and ambitions and their employers’ biases.
Roshan came back to work after a gap of six years. “The hospitality industry is not very conducive for women to work,” she says. She struggled to find a job, and when she did, with the Carlson group in 2008 and worked for three years, she “put in double the work at a lower salary”. All through, she required her parents’ support and went through separation from her son during his Board exams, after she joined the Crowne Plaza hotel and worked there for eight years and got transferred in 2015 from Bengaluru to Hyderabad. She felt she could not leave her job a second time. She did not want to risk a second motherhood penalty. 







“Deep-rooted biases in our society compel women to remain the primary caregivers and any attempt on their part to divert from home duties makes them a target of criticism, judgement, and exploitation,” says Neela Kaushik, the founder of Gurgaon Moms and an influencer. A business analyst with Ford Technology in Chennai, she did not find a job when she wanted to return after a three-year break as a stay-at-home mom back in 2008. “I used to be so frustrated because the few opportunities that came by extracted more work at one-third of the salary I had earned earlier,” says the now 41-year-old. Like many women, Neela started an online community that has grown to 33,000 women and is a brand today. She says her aim is to create a safe space for women from where they could network, relaunch themselves, and live their dreams. 
Hyderabad-based psychologist MV Lakshmi Devi says women often reinvent themselves. According to her, it is a kind of a catharsis that brings improvement in physical and mental health.
A 2014 International Labour Organization study threw up a horrifying statistic: that 90% of women the world over do not go back to the jobs they held before they became mothers. Archana Talwar (name changed to protect identity), a life coach based in Bengaluru, admits she faced moments when she even felt suicidal, after her inability to get back to her IT job on the same terms and conditions. “Our systems and work culture are still not fine-tuned for a woman. One has to make individual choices. You could accept a low salary, or a loss of pay, or work under someone junior,” she says. 
With constant churning of emotions, women go into a state of denial over their health. “They internalise their struggles and do not express their symptoms unless they become visible,” says Lakshmi.
Bridging the gapSairee Chahal, the CEO of Sheroes, from Delhi, feels women are now understanding their worth and taking proactive steps to start their own enterprises. “The lack of jobs is a trigger in some ways for entrepreneurship and helping women develop their identity as independent professionals,” she says. At the same time, Sairee feels, several progressive businesses are now bringing more empathy into their hiring models.Neha Bagaria from Bengaluru says that after a three-and-a-half-year gap from work, she was beginning to lose confidence. She decided to launch JobsForHer to help women restart their careers. “Motherhood can be very lonely and I realised more than flexible job conditions women look for flexible mindsets,” she says. Yet, she adds, nobody likes to lose a good pool of human resources. Several connecting platforms and communities of diverse kinds of women from leaders and mentors to motivators, guides and co-partners are seeing increased participation now.
When Adyasha N was expecting her baby, she was working with an IT company, but a sabbatical scheme had just been announced. When she wanted to join back after almost 18 months, she suffered a loss of confidence and feared she had not kept pace in skill development; people junior to her had moved ahead. It took her more than three years to cover the gap. “I stayed with my parents to get enough free time to focus on areas I had lost time on. I worked much harder.”
Lakshmi says women keep pushing themselves because they also carry the guilt of either leaving their children in crèches or with parents. Plus, there is the fear about their own savings.

How a Memory Maps project is creating a sense of belonging in Bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-a-memory-maps-project-is-creating-a-sense-of-belonging-in-bengaluru/article31021534.ece,"The midmorning sun is warm, indicating the arrival of early summer in Bengaluru. Walkers and joggers at Sankey Tank make their exit. A few latecomers enter, ready to brave the heat. But mostly, the place is vacant. On the steps of the smaller, square tank inside the premises, pigeons outnumber humans. They are perhaps waiting with false hopes for puffed rice or whatever food humans usually throw for them. A few turtles swim on the surface of the water, near the steps, attracting the attention of a child who shrieks, “Tuttle! tuttle!” 
The sight is pleasing. This is perhaps how Sankey Tank always looks on Friday mornings. 

Outside the tank’s premises, amidst a group clasping small notebooks and pens or pencils, was Harry Kukreja, 54, who has lived all his life near Sankey Tank, in Sadashivnagar. To him, oddly, the sight and even the place is unfamiliar. For, this isn’t the Sankey Tank that existed while he grew up. The smaller tank, for instance, wasn’t there. The main tank itself was much greener and bigger.
One of the places near the now 137-year-old tank was a low-lying vacant strip of land called Deeps. It was a name the locals gave it because the place was, well, deep. According to Kukreja, it was a rainwater catchment area, which was connected to the main tank with a pipe. Growing up, it was a favourite haunt for Kukreja and the other children in his neighbourhood. “We would go there to play cricket, we learnt riding bicycles, motorbikes…” he recalls. Where Deeps was, there is now the Sadashivnagar Park. You might not find Deeps even if you Google it. It doesn’t exist on the internet. It doesn’t exist in the real world. It exists only in the collective memories of a few Sadashivnagar residents.
Travel writer Aliyeh Rizvi and artist Arzu Mistry, since the beginning of the 2010s, were working on their projects, separately. Aliyeh was busy with Native Place (which was about building awareness on Bengaluru’s history and culture through walks) and Arzu with Art in Transit (which was about starting a dialogue about the city through art). Both received positive responses for their projects. When, in 2016, they collaborated for the first time, it didn’t take long to figure out that their works shared the same objective: connecting people and the city. So, for the next two years, they devised what they now call Memory Maps.
Memory Maps is a walk-workshop combination that helps people foster a sense of belonging to the city (read the box to know how). It asks people to be psychogeographers (definition on the other box). It encourages people to take a stroll around the city; investigate its alleys, roads, lakes, parks and buildings; and get lost in it. 







With the aid of our smart devices, we are increasingly getting quicker, more efficient in getting from one point to another. But we might lose our agency if we mindlessly pursue convenience and efficiency. The sophisticated algorithms that Facebook or Google deploy will determine where we go and what we do within a city. 
“Google maps don’t allow us to get lost,” says Arzu. “Of course, it makes navigation easier. But it doesn’t leave room for curiosity. When you are lost, you feel confused. But that confusion causes you to explore.”
Aliyeh concurs. “The real essence of travel comes from a (physical) map and not an app. Getting lost is an adventure. And apps don’t allow us to do that.”
Aliyeh, who was born and brought up in Bengaluru, has always liked walking. It helps her observe and register, at her own pace, buildings, streets, people, shops, statues, et al. — these things are essential for her as a writer of travel, history, and culture. “And, Bangalore, especially, is meant for walking. We keep complaining of the city’s traffic. But this city was never meant for so many cars; it was a small cantonment city meant for pedestrians and carriages.”
An important part of Aliyeh and Arzu’s Memory Maps is walking. But the duo clarify that they don’t conduct a heritage walk; “it is more interpretative, where you observe and think about things.” So far, they have covered Cubbon Park, Malleshwaram, Richmond Town and, recently, Sadashivnagar, as a part of the City Scripts event organised by IIHS, in which Kukreja participated. The demography of the participants keeps varying. For instance, the Cubbon Park Memory Maps had mostly natives of Bengaluru, whereas the Sadashivnagar edition had only a handful of people who were born and brought up in the city.
After every edition of Memory Maps, Aliyeh and Arzu compile the participants’ maps into a book. Arzu and Aliyeh want to take their project not only to more places but also to more communities. 
For instance, they have tied up with the transgender community, Aravani Art Project, for their next Memory Map edition.
Sitaram Sujir, a psychologist, was one of the participants of Memory Walks at Sadashivnagar. He has been living in Bengaluru for the last two decades. Still, the city, he says, appears new to him, everyday. “Irrespective of the number of years you live in a city, you don’t always explore it fully. I want to do that. I stay in Sanjaynagar but I want to meet people from other parts of the city, get to know their stories.” It is the reason why he signed up for Memory Maps. 
“I wish to do a similar project in my hometown, Mangalore,” he says, “There is this Venkataramana temple, which is 250 years old. As per tradition, every year, the deity used to be taken through seven towns within the city. But these towns don’t exist any more.”",society
Coronavirus: 15-20% impact on revenues of big ticket Hindi films,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/covid-19-15-20-impact-on-revenues-of-big-ticket-hindi-films/article31025196.ece,"Baaghi 3, at ₹17.5 crore net, may have logged in the highest opening day collections for a Hindi film in 2020 so far, but it is also the first to face the adverse effect of the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the box office forecast of trade magazine Super Cinema, the opening day range for director Ahmed Khan’s Tiger Shroff starrer had been projected at a much higher range — between ₹26 and ₹28 crore — than what has been delivered. “Weekend was better but the trends have been lower than expected, the collections have been affected nationwide,” says Amul Mohan, editor of the magazine.
Shailesh Kapoor, CEO of media consulting firm Ormax Media, concurs. Ormax’s opening day projections for the film had also been substantially higher at ₹21 crore. Its projections for the forthcoming Sooryavanshi stand at a whopping ₹30.8 crore. However, in a virus-less market, the same figure for the Rohit Shetty biggie starring Akshay Kumar, would have been even higher at about ₹36 crore, says Mr. Kapoor.
He predicts a 15-20% impact on the big ticket Hindi films in the coming months and an even bigger one on the medium and small films which, as opposed to the tentpole films, are anyhow regarded as “easier to skip for a later day”. According to him, Homi Adjania’s Irrfan Khan starrer, Angrezi Medium, that releases coming Friday, may face a 25-30% impact.
The impact has been felt far less in South film industries with fewer cases detected so far. An Ormax study of the impact of COVID-19 on theatre-going behaviour in India conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu industries belt on Thursday-Friday-Saturday last week showed that 23% regular theatre goers in India are likely to stay away from theatres till the threat is reduced. The proportion is higher in Hindi speaking markets (26%) than in South India (17%).

In view of the situation which is changing day to day, Ormax would be conducting the study every three days and coming up with the findings twice a week. The next round of figures will be out of this Thursday.
Delhi-based exhibitor Sanjay Mehta, however, thinks there are several factors — not just COVID-19 — eating into the earnings of Baaghi 3 and other recent Bollywood films. “The low pre-holi period and board exams have come in the way and Baaghi is a predominantly youth-oriented franchisee,” he says. The law and order, violence and protests have affected business in Delhi; the late evening and night shows — largely patronised by Muslims — are running empty in Uttar Pradesh.
According to Mr. Mehta, things will come to a head if things go out of control in the weeks ahead and if the government decides to shut down theatres temporarily. He remembers the case of a film Main Khiladi Tu Anari distributed by him back in 1994. “It started off at 100% collection. On the 6th day, the Delhi government ordered cinema closure due to a plague scare. The film couldn’t gather the same momentum when the theatres reopened,” he remembers.

According to Mr. Kapoor, more than the individual collections, it’s the possible changes in release calendar that are more worrying and will throw things in a tizzy. Already there are rumours in the market about Reliance Entertainment delaying Sooryavanshi, slated for a March 24 release, and Kabir Khan’s 83 with Ranveer Singh doing a Kapil Dev that is supposed to come out on April 10. A Sooryavanshi spokesperson, however, clarified that the decision is still awaited and will be taken only on Wednesday.
“A massive 27-film franchisee like Bond has a bigger market and a lot more at stake but the seven-month postponement because of the outbreak could make even the bigger Bollywood producers do a rethink,” says Mr. Mohan.
“It will mean that there will be no film of sizeable scale and star cast in the next 3-4 weeks. March and April will become dead months if there is no content,” says Mr. Kapoor. The first quarter has anyhow been bad with only Tanhaji and Baaghi 3 faring well.
The only other time the industry had faced such a crisis in recent past was during demonetisation. However, things had stabilised by the time of the big XMas releases in December. Uncertainty is a big factor now when it comes to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the situation volatile and changing by the day. A lot, however, will still depend on how Baaghi 3 fares in the first week.",movies
"Max von Sydow, ‘Seventh Seal’ and ‘The Exorcist’ star, dead at 90 ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/max-von-sydow-seventh-seal-and-the-exorcist-star-dead-at-90/article31024599.ece," Veteran actor Max von Sydow, who famously played a game of chess with Death in Ingmar Bergman’s cult classic The Seventh Seal and the Three-Eyed Raven in Game of Thrones, has died at the age of 90.
The Sweden-born French actor died on Sunday, his representatives confirmed the news to Deadline.

"Puri Jagannadh is an inspiration for ‘Solo Brathuke So Better’, says director Subbu ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-subbu-for-telugu-film-solo-brathuke-so-better/article31021393.ece,"Debutant director of Solo brathuke so better Subrahmanyam, had changed his name to ‘Subbu’ after Pawan Kalyan’s name in the film Thammudu that released in 1999. Such was Subbu’s craze for films. During his school days inspired by Uday Kiran’s films, Subbu even wrote a story and posted it to director Teja, thus conveying to his parents, that his interest lies in films. He chose to do his engineering in Hyderabad so that he could be close to the film industry.
Now with his film Solo brathuke so better scheduled for May release, Subbu believes it’s a result of his association and studying of people than reading any books. The promo shows Sai Dharam Tej goading the youth to stay single, standing in front of the photographs of famous leaders like Narendra Modi, R Narayana Murthy,Vajpayee, Lata Mangeshkar. His point being they all became famous in their fields because they were not emotionally involved and remained single. Subbu adds, “Director Puri Jagannadh is from our neighbouring village and so we took him as our inspiration and followed him and his ideals. The same way, the hero in the film takes the icons behind him on a poster as an inspiration. Love, late night texts, wasting time on impressing people is dealt with. There is a twist in the girl’s character and I don’t want to reveal it at this stage. If there is no girl, there is no godava and no gola in our lives and this phase comes to all at certain time in life. You will realise what we mean after a break up. My married friends keep telling me that I should put off marriage as long as I can.”
Speaking about his journey, Subbu informs that things started looking up for him when he moved into cinematographer Rasool’s team and got into his writing department and also worked as an assistant DoP and then became an associate director in Ooseravelli as an assistant DoP and as an associate director to Bommarillu Bhaskar’s Ongole gitta and Virinchi Verma’s Majnu. Post Majnu and Nannu Dochukundavate, he gained confidence and decided it’s time for him to direct a film and began working on a story. 
The experience he accumulated he thought was enough to face problems and find solutions during filmmaking. “No one spoon feeds you, you have to take an initiative and show that you are interested in working in a particular department. We have to keep our eyes and ears open to grasp every small thing from each director including their vibes,” says Subbu.
 The story for Solo brathuke... was an offshoot of an idea he saw on YouTube. “Many incidents that happened in that video had happened in my life too and I connected to it immediately. There are too many directors and stars have many options these days. For me, producer Bapineedu was a blessing. He liked my story and took it forward.”
Subbu is all praise for cinematographer Dileep. “He had an amazing quality of showing his visuals in an aesthetic way and music director Thaman delivered good music. Solo brathuke so better has a message which is simple and straight. It will trace the life of a youth who believes in such philosophy,” adds Subbu.
The film is releasing on May 1 and Subbu wants to see at the theatres in Visakhapatnam where he spent most of his younger days watching films at Jagadamba theatre and other places.Finally Subbu says the kick of being a director is on a different plane, “I remember someone saying in an interview that Brahma kept a few people aside when creating the world and these people are movie directors. They create a parallel world of entertainment and escapism for people.”",movies
"‘Kappela’ movie review: Promising debut, but with a dampener effect ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kappela-film-review-promising-debut-but-with-a-dampener-effect/article31020750.ece,"A particular kind of deftness in craft, surprising in a debutant filmmaker, marks Muhammad Musthafa’s handling of a pretty thin story in the initial parts of Kappela. Yet, it is only with a sinking feeling that one can watch him squandering what he had so painstakingly set up, when it comes to finishing it in style.
Jessy (Anna Ben)’s call to a wrong number sets off an unlikely romance with autorickshaw driver Vishnu (Roshan Mathew).
 For an academically weak girl living in an orthodox, lower middle class family, in a high range village with hardly anything to look forward to, the voice on the other side becomes a ray of hope for a better life.
KappelaCast: Anna Ben, Sreenath Bhasi, Roshan MathewDirection: Muhammad Musthafa 
The director portrays her as having a fun time with her close friend, to whom she passingly expresses these disappointments in a playful manner, at the same time giving one a sense that these are things that has affected her much more deeply. 
Things take a turn when the couple decide to meet finally and a third character — Roy (Sreenath Bhasi) — enters their lives by chance.
 To give us a sense of Roy’s rough character, the script commendably cuts off from the love story at a key point. It is meant to create in our minds an expectation of how the rest of the film will pan out. 
That is when the director unleashes upon the audience the trick up his sleeve, which can be rewarding or disappointing, depending on which way you look at it.
Strictly from the filmmaking point of view, it is an unexpected turn, which can satisfy the viewers, although executed too swiftly. It does talk about a much-discussed issue, but this could have been much more than just another movie with a message.
When one looks at how the movie’s message can be misused by those wanting to curtail the agency of women to make decisions concerning their lives, especially their relationship choices, the turn that the script takes is disappointing. 
The otherwise well-intentioned makers may have inadvertently provided a respectable tool for the moral policing gangs. In the end, when Jessy is convinced by an educated girl to not go in for legal options, it becomes a cautionary tale for women deciding their life on their own, rather than resign to the one chosen by their parents.
The performances, especially of Sreenath Bhasi and Anna Ben, who essays a character similar to her previous two, elevate the movie a few notches. 
Muhammad Musthafa shows a lot of promise in his debut directorial, despite the let down in the end.",movies

Trading on U.S. stock exchanges was halted immediately after opening, as the benchmark S&P 500 fell 7% to its lowest since June 2019, triggering an automatic 15-minute cut-out put in place after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The energy index slumped 15.3% to its lowest level since August 2004 and crude prices were on track for their worst day in three decades as Saudi Arabia moved to significantly raise oil production after OPEC’s supply cut agreement with Russia collapsed.
“The lower it does go, the more people are likely to panic even further,” said Rick Meckler a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
“Given the circuit breaker program, it’s more likely than not that selling won’t continue at this pace throughout the day, but the psychology of things is very much a herd mentality.”

“The Indian markets followed the global market meltdown which was triggered by rapidly spreading virus and free fall in crude oil prices,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
The global crude prices were in a free fall mode registering the biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991.
After falling to an intra-day low of around $27 per barrel, crude was trading at around $33 a barrel level — nearly 20% lower than previous day’s price — around 8 pm.
The fall in crude prices was primarily on account of the all-out price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. In the Sensex pack, the ONGC was the worst performer of the day, shedding over 16%.
This affected investor sentiments that are already down on account of the virus outbreak.
The dampened sentiments could be further gauged from the fact that trading at the NYSE had to be halted for 15 minutes as circuit breakers were triggered after the S&P 500 index had lost 7%.
“The relentless FPI selling in the last two weeks has added to the overall downtrend. There was panic globally as fears of rising cases of COVID-19 in countries like Italy and the U.S. made investors nervous. This has led to worries over a prolonged global economic slowdown,” said Mr. Khemka.

Rupee slips below 74/USD level in early trade amid mounting fears of coronavirus-led slowdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/rupee-slips-below-74usd-level-in-early-trade-amid-mounting-fears-of-coronavirus-led-slowdown/article31021045.ece," The Indian rupee continued its downward journey on Monday, sliding another 16 paise to 74.03 against the US dollar in opening trade, tracking weak opening in domestic equities amid mounting fears of a coronavirus-led economic slowdown.
 Forex traders said weak opening in domestic equities and foreign fund outflows dragged the local unit.
Though weakening of the American currency in the overseas market and easing crude oil prices supported the rupee, but traders believe there is mounting fears of recession in major economies due to the coronavirus outbreak and this could weigh on the local unit.
 The rupee opened weak at 73.99 at the interbank forex market and then fell further to 74.03, down 16 paise over its last close.

Coronavirus | Sports events hit worldwide by outbreak of COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-sports-events-hit-worldwide-by-outbreak-of-covid-19/article31033611.ece,"The final round of the Hero Santosh Trophy 2019-20, scheduled to be played in Aizawl, has been postponed in wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. This comes after an health advisory issued by the government with regards to the Covid-19 outbreak.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the suspension until April 3 of all sporting events in the country, including the top-flight Serie A football league.
Questions remain about getting the season finished. At least three rounds of matches will need to be rearranged after April 3 before the end of the season scheduled for May 24.
There is little room for manoeuvre because of Euro 2020 beginning on June 12. And there are also concerns that Euro 2020, due to be hosted across 12 countries including Italy, might face an unprecedented cancellation.
LaLiga too confirmed on Tuesday that first and second division matches in Spain will be staged behind closed doors for at least two weeks.
Barcelona’s Champions League round of 16 return match against Napoli scheduled for March 18 has been ordered to be played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus outbreak, both clubs announced Tuesday.
Wednesday’s Rhine derby between Borussia Monchengladbach and Cologne will be the first Bundesliga game to be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus, local authorities announced on Tuesday.
German Football League (DFL) chief Christian Seifert warned Sunday that “the season must end by mid-May” in order to ensure clarity over promotion, relegation and qualification for international competition.
Sevilla’s match at home to Roma in the Europa League on Thursday will also be put behind closed doors. 
Organisers of the Miami Open tennis said the tournament was still set to go ahead, a day after the ATP/WTA Indian Wells event in California was cancelled due to coronavirus.
A brief statement released Monday by the Miami organisers on Twitter said preparations for the March 23-April 5 event were “moving forward as scheduled.”",other sports

Also ending with bronze medals were Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) and Pooja Rani (75kg). All the six boxers have already secured their tickets to the Olympic Games by making the semifinals but Krishan and Kaur will come back with at least silver medals after entering the finals.
Krishan fought with a cut sustained on his left eyelid before claiming a split decision victory over second seed Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist.
The 28-year-old Krishan will face feisty Jordanian Eishaih Hussein, who sent Asian gold-medallist and top seed Bobo-Usmon Baturov packing in a split decision.
Krishan, a former world bronze-winner and a Commonwealth Games gold-medallist, was the busier of the two boxers despite the injury he picked up in the second round and his right jabs were particularly effective through the bout.
Kaur, on the other hand, upstaged third seed and Asian silver-medallist Shih-Yi Wu of Taiwan in a terrific come-from-behind win. The Indian trailed in the opening round, roared back in the second with her precisely-placed combination punches before fending off a strong attack from Wu in the final three minutes.
She will take on Korea’s Oh Yeonji in the final on Wednesday.
In another good result, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) remained in the hunt for an Olympic berth by defeating Manh Cuong Nguyen of Vietnam 4-1 in the first box-off. He will have to get the better of Shabbos Negmatulloev of Tajikistan in the last box-off on Wednesday to book a ticket to Tokyo as only the top five qualify in his weight category.
However, in a major disappointment for India, six-time world champion Mary Kom lost to China’s Chang Yuan, a former Youth Olympics champion, in a split verdict.
Also bowing out with a bronze was world silver-medallist and top seed Panghal, who went down to Jianguan Hu of China in a split 3-2 decision. It was revenge for Hu, an Olympic and world bronze-medallist who lost to Panghal in the Asian semifinals last year.
Panghal had endured exhausting contests in the run-up to the semifinals and he could not outpace the determined Chinese in Tuesday’s clash.
Earlier, two-time world bronze-medallist and second seed Borgohain lost to third seed and 2018 world silver-medallist Hong Gu of China in a unanimous 5-0 verdict after struggling to find her range against the experienced 30-year-old.
Rani too could not find her rhythm against world champion and top seed Li Qian, who is also a two-time Asian gold-medallist.

Sindhu spearheading the campaign.
 The season’s first Super 1000 event witnessed a dramatic build-up in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed over 4000 lives and infected more than 100,000 people globally.
 In the United Kingdom itself, the number of infected people has gone past 300 with five deaths so far.
 A number of tournaments, including the German Open, was postponed since the deadly disease first broke out in Wuhan, China, affecting the preparation of the shuttlers for the Tokyo Olympics.
 Concerned about their health, seven Indian shuttlers, including former top 10 player H.S. Prannoy and world No. 10 men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy have withdrawn from the All England.
 The $1,100,000 BWF world tour event offers 12,000 ranking points to the winner and with the Olympic qualification on the line, most of the top players will be seen in action at the Arena Birmingham.
 While Sindhu, who is almost assured of an Olympic berth, will look to end a nearly two-decade-old title jinx at the All England Championship by adding the coveted title to her 2019 world championships gold, former silver medallist Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth will eye valuable points to squeeze inside the top 16 before the deadline for Olympic qualification ends on April 28.
 Chief national coach P Gopichand was the last Indian to win the championship, in 2001. Sindhu will look to overturn a run of recent poor finishes and emulate her mentor with the top medal.
 World No. 6 Sindhu, who had reached the semifinal in 2018, will need to cut down on unforced errors and strengthen her defence as she opens against USA’s Beiwen Zhang. The 24-year-old is expected to take on Korea’s Sung Ji Hyun if she crosses the opening hurdle.
 Saina, who had made it to the finals in 2015, is in dire need of some ranking points to qualify for the Olympics and she will face a stern test against third seeded Japanese Akane Yamaguchi in the opening round.
 Former world No. 1 Srikanth, who had reached the quarters in 2019, will have to get across Olympic champion and third seed Chen Long to have any chance of going deep in the draw and retain his ranking points.
 World championships bronze medallist B. Sai Praneeth, who is also almost assured of a berth at Tokyo, will open against China’s Zhao Jun Peng.
Former Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap, who is coming back after recovering from a back injury at Spain Masters last month, will be up against Indonesia’s Shesar Hiren Rhustavito in the opener.
 Young Lakshya Sen, who had claimed five titles last year, will be making his debut in the prestigious tournament and he will begin against Hong Kong’s Lee Cheuk Yiu.
 Among other Indians, Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Siki Reddy will face Australian pair of Setyana Mapasa and Gronya Somerville in women’s doubles, while Sikki will pair up with Pranaav Jerry Chopra to take on top seeded Chinese Zheng Si Wei and Huang Ya Qiong. ",other sports

Vikas — a former World youth champion, youth Olympics medal winner, World championships bronze medallist and an Asian Games gold medallist — had switched to professional boxing in 2018, but returned to the amateur fold late last year to chase his ultimate dream of winning an Olympic medal.
After securing a quota place, in the Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifier in Amman, Jordan, for what would be his third Olympic appearance, Vikas was relieved. 
“Am quite satisfied after achieving my first target of qualifying for the Olympics on the first attempt. I had trained very hard for this,” Vikas told The Hindu on Monday.
“It was difficult to switch from amateur to professional and vice versa. I trained overtime to make it look easy. I want to give the country an Olympic gold.”
The 28–year-old, who weighs around 70kg, followed his friend and professional boxer Neeraj Goyat’s advice to jump back from 75kg to 69kg. He acknowledged the support of the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) and its coaches, who took care of his switch-back to amateur boxing. 
Vikas said his maturity worked to his advantage in Amman. “I have become more mature now and it helped me in the ring. I was never under immense pressure, which is generally seen in amateur boxers. “I have boxed at Madison Square Garden and other places in New York. So that helped me deal with pressure as boxing is a mind game.”
One of the finest boxers India has ever produced, Vikas has enjoyed his journey for more than a decade. “I boxed with two generations — Vijender Singh, Jitender Kumar, Akhil Kumar, Dinesh Kumar and Jai Bhagwan in the past and Amit Panghal, Satish Kumar and Manish Kaushik now. 
“The previous generation was tough and the present one too is tough. I love the boxing sense of both generations and the way Indian boxing has been growing,” he said.",other sports
Google Cloud unveils machine images to simplify work flow,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-cloud-unveils-machine-images-to-simplify-work-flow/article31031193.ece,"
Google has announced machine images, a new type of Compute Engine resource that contains all the information people need to create, back up or restore a virtual machine, reducing the amount of time people spend managing their Cloud environment.
Custom images capture the contents of a single disk, for example, a boot disk, which can be used to create new instances that are preconfigured with the apps that you need.
Machine images are a more comprehensive resource that can contain multiple disks, as well as all of the information required to capture and create a new instance.
According to Google, it will reduce the time network admins and data scientists spend managing their cloud environments by eliminating extra steps and streamlining operations.
“In addition to storing complete instance properties and data, machine images use the same differential disk back-up technology that powers incremental snapshots, giving you fast, reliable and cost-effective instance back-ups,” explained Ari Liberman, Product Manager, Google Compute Engine.
“The new machine images make it easy to create new instances at the heart of your scalability, backup and disaster recovery strategy,” he added in a statement.",technology
Coronavirus: How this Singapore illustrator’s comics fight misinformation in the age of COVID-19 ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/coronavirus-how-this-singapore-illustrators-comics-fight-misinformation-in-the-age-of-covid-19/article31031982.ece,"WhatsApp forwards ask you to stock up on N95 masks. Your friends are buying immunity-boosting supplements. Office colleagues recommend changing the soap you use. Meanwhile, your mother sends you bottles of nilavembu kashayam.
Life in the age of COVID-19 can be complicated. As the coronavirus scare spreads further with every passing day, so does the flood of (mis)information bombarding people from everywhere, and parents across the world are in a fix on how to educate their kids on staying safe.
But then, Weiman Kow’s comic happened.
The Singapore artist’s first 17-panel illustration has gone viral since January 31; she had put it out after Singapore recorded its first case of the virus. It begins by reading, “There’s only ONE thing you need to understand about how coronavirus spreads…” and has quickly become the go-to guide for kids — and adults — to take simple measures in fighting the spread.
“It all happened when I was recovering from a respiratory illness earlier this year,” says Weiman, “The news about the ‘Wuhan virus’ had just broke, and as I was doing research on it, I found that many informative articles about the topic were difficult to understand. Being an illustrator, I decided to simplify what I’d learnt from trustworthy health sources and break it down into a comic format, so that even children could easily grasp it.”
Today, Weiman’s illustrations can be found in adverts and posters — even translated into vernacular languages too, for more people to understand. Her work can be seen in the Chennai Airport as well. 
 Social media will be a mess of misinformation, and I don’t think there will be any stopping it, since fear-mongering is how social media companies make their money. Even I get caught up in it sometimes, and have to remind myself to verify facts, go to the WHO website or national health websites.
That’s why I’m launching a campaign called Comics For Good, to encourage everyone to look at those sites (and not social media!) to fight the misinformation. We will run campaigns to showcase comic work that highlights social issues, and encourage artists to create work along those lines at the page: https://www.instagram.com/comicsforgood/
We have also started an international Kids Draw COVID-19 Facts Challenge, to show that anyone can be an advocate for right health information, as long as they get their information from a reputable health source.
Yes. Up until when I did the comic, all the messaging I’ve seen from health authorities were about “What to do” (handwashing, etc) but no one is explaining the “Why we do this?” I think that is why it is so popular: it gives people a reason, and a certain sense of power and safety comes from knowing. 






Weiman’s popular comic on staying safe from the coronavirus outbreak
 






The goal I want to achieve with my comics is always to enable my readers to make the right decisions with the knowledge, rather than offer prescriptive actions. After all, most things are a matter of choice, individual location and situation, and personal inclination towards risk (like wearing or not wearing masks).
I’ve also committed to having future comics vetted by doctors.
My focus is now on making sure good information reaches people in Third World countries, where health systems are weaker, where governments are unable to put in extensive tracing measures and subsidies for the public to come forward when sick. 
 It started very early on, within a week of posting the first comic. People commenting on the Facebook post in Singapore were asking for a Chinese version to show their parents, as some of them do not speak English. So I created one with some volunteers.
Then when requests started coming in from Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam, Mexico, India, Portugal, I had a ready set of images with no text that I could forward them, with translation guidelines.






A Malayalam transalation of the comic
 






My structure of sending out translator packs to volunteer translators was heavily influenced by the tech community’s open source communities. My philosophy is in giving people the tools to do the best they can for their communities, at a time like this, and to encourage collaboration between various groups so translation work gets done faster. 
I’m creating free pdf downloads for various languages in India, with the help of volunteer translators at: https://gumroad.com/
Yes, I have learnt that my first comic is lacking some WHO precautions, and is one of the contenders for the next topic to work on. I also have a draft of a comic on fighting misinformation, and how it can lead to further spread of the disease. The way I see it, it’s no longer a fight against COVID19, but a fight against misinformation, a fight against the infodemic. So I’ll be prioritising fighting misinformation over comics on new facts.







I’ve also committed to having future comics vetted by doctors.
My focus is now on making sure good information reaches people in the third world countries, where health systems are weaker, where governments are unable to put in extensive tracing measures and subsidies for the public to come forward when sick. (Singapore is lucky in that regard.)
I learnt that my comic became popular in India from a PDF with the Siemens logo. Unfortunately, I wasn’t aware that Siemens took my images, modified the text, removed my watermark, and put their logo on it until people started to share it to me. They actually sourced it from Taiba Hospital, who in turn also took my work without my knowledge. I also find that the Chennai Airport is using my images without my permission, and have removed my watermark as well.
While I am upset at not being contacted about these unofficial changes made to my comic, the edits to the text by Taiba Hospital are medically accurate and useful to the general public.",entertainment

"Thanks to this engineer, visits to Chennai's zoo are more fun",https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-zoo-engineer/article31031485.ece,"Her day starts with greeting the animals at the zoo. Sudha Ramen, Deputy Director, Arignar Anna Zoological Park, then heads to her office for paperwork, instructs office staff based on inputs, and settles larger issues like animal exchange. “People long to go to forests on vacation, and this is my workplace,” she smiles.
When she sat across the UPSC interview panel in February 2013, Sudha knew what was coming. “I will be me,” she said to herself. The panel asked: “With your Bio-medical Engineering background, how do you think you will fit into the Forest Service?” Her love for the outdoors standing by her, she proceeded to link bio-medical education with the environment. On April 9, 2013, Sudha found that she had made it to the all-India list — her rank was 45.
Today, Sudha uses her engineering knowledge to come up with digital solutions that make visits to the zoo more engaging and people-friendly.







“Our team has developed the all-inclusive Vandalur Zoo mobile application,” she says. The first of its kind in India, it can be used to book tickets, navigate the zoo, has information as text and audio clips on animals there... there even are quirky selfie frames and one can watch live streaming of animals 24x7.

Vandalur zoo becomes a bird watcher’s paradise 
This particular feature is quite popular: the streaming covers 14 animal species that can be watched in enclosures that resemble their habitats. These high-definition videos have pulled in over 4.5 crore views. Also available on their website, “the feature has made www.aazp.in one of the most visited websites on the Internet,” according to Sudha. The app has 50,000 users so far. Download it to plan your visit, confirm your ticket — it is the ‘green channel’ to enter the zoo.
Sudha is surrounded by animals, and deems it an opportunity of a lifetime. But she always visualised herself as a doctor. She ended up doing Engineering and came to Chennai to work with an IT firm.
She moved to Puducherry after marriage, where she tried her hand at Medical entrance exams. But she could not get through, and decided to take the UPSC, Group I&II, State Bank, SSC, IB, IBBS exams instead.
In Chennai, Sudha spent her days at an academy to train; at night, she pored through books in libraries. In the end, she landed six Government jobs, but chose IFS since she found “the three letters ‘IFS’ inspiring, it’s an all-India service”.
Sudha completed training at Dehradun with gold medals. The mobile app she designed — a one-stop lookout for all information related to choosing and planting trees — went into Tamilnadu Treepedia and won the Dr Kalam Innovation in Governance Award. In July, 2017, once she was posted Deputy Director at AAZP, she set out to digitise its operations.

Today, the zoo has e-eye surveillance with 170 cameras. “We use it to observe animals 24x7 during delivery and nursing, monitor young ones, understand animal behaviour. An animal in distress gets immediate vet care,” points out Sudha. After she took over, the animal adoption programme has gone online and has seen a jump in response.
“We have vibrant interactions on social media with the public,” she adds, “Thanks to team work, the zoo has been featured in the WAZA World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.”
Sudha says that she is “lucky to be contributing to namma Vandalur Zoo”. “We revived the Otteri lake and carry out improvisations constantly. We can teach people about zoo practices, the needs of animals, their rescue and rehab, adoption, and conservation.”
Sudha is a ‘nocturnal bird. “I work on apps at night, read proposals, answer mail/social-media messages.” She supervises forest, veterinarian, and biologist teams. “Ultimately, animals are our responsibility,” she feels.
Sudha is sure that Vandalur will be a memorable tenure for her. Right now, she is all set to flag off systems to keep animals cool in summer.

The reality today is that unemployment remained low in many markets, the company said and added that organisations globally were still struggling to find people with the right skills.
An employment outlook study it conducted across 5,153 Indian enterprises revealed steady hiring trends for the upcoming three months. As per the study, mining and construction, wholesale and retail trade, and services sectors would lead the job market and small companies with employee strength in the 10-49 range are expected to hire more than others. 
Most of these recruitments will take place in the east and north regions of the country.
Workforce gains are anticipated in seven industry sectors during the coming quarter. Mining and construction employers report the strongest hiring intentions with a net employment outlook of 16% (growth). Respectable payroll gains are also forecast in two sectors with outlook of 15% in the wholesale and retail trade sector and 13% in the services sector.
New jobs in public administration, education, finance, insurance and real estate, transportation and utilities sectors are expected to grow as well. ”There is a dearth of talent and companies are ready to pay premium wages for the right talent with the appropriate skills.

Revolt to set up ₹400-cr. e-motorbike unit ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/revolt-to-set-up-400-cr-e-motorbike-unit/article31033922.ece,"Rahul Sharma, co-founder of Micromax Informatics Ltd., is planning to set up a second manufacturing unit for production of e-motorcycles and is scouting for a suitable place in the South.
“There has been no disruption in the automobile sector for the last 30 years, so we decided to do something new about two years ago,” said Rahul Sharma, founder, Revolt Intellicorp. “That is when I switched over from mobiles to the mobility space,” he said. 
“We conceived this e-motorcycle to offer better products to consumers who aspire for good-looking vehicles combined with power and performance. 
“When we gave vehicles at an affordable price with lesser total cost of ownership, maintenance cost and less fuel expenses compared with conventional bikes, about 30,000 users booked it without seeing it,” he said.
Mr. Sharma also launched RV400 and RV300 e-motorcycles.
 Chennai is the fifth city where Revolt Intellicorp began selling its motorcycles and the first batch of e-motorcycles were sold out within hours, he said.
“We never expected such a kind of response for our products from consumers. Currently, the waiting period for our bikes is three months and this will be brought down by the year end by increasing production,” he said.
Going by the trend, Revolt Intellicorp would be hitting full production capacity by the year end. It was time to take a call for setting up the second manufacturing unit, he said.
Company officials were in talks with State governments in the southern part of the country, he said.
Mr. Sharma established the first plant in Manesar, investing close to ₹500 crore.
Investment in the second unit would be in the range of ₹400 crore to ₹500 crore. 
“What we are asking the State governments is to provide support to consumers on the lines of the New Delhi government in the form of zero registration fee and help consumers adopt to emission free vehicles,” he said. 
Asserting that the adoption rate of electric vehicles by the consumers would be faster, he said it would happen in the next three years against the planned 2030. 
“Our goal is to capture a double-digit market share in motorbike segment in the country and be ranked among top players such as Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors and Honda,” he said. ",business
ZoloStays to raise $100 mn for expansion,https://www.thehindu.com/business/zolostays-to-raise-100-mn-for-expansion/article31033917.ece,"ZoloStays Property Solutions, a co-living and home rental start-up, is in talks with private equity investors to raise $100 million to fund its expansion plans, said a top executive.
“Co-living is one of the most viable and sustainable ways of living that we can create for the future,” said Nikhil Sikri, co-founder and CEO, Zolostays. “We conceived the idea of co-living some five years ago to help students and working professionals and the idea had caught up,” he said.
According to him, the co-living market size across India’s top 30 cities was expected to more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $6.67 billion.
Founded by Mr SikriNikhil, Akhil Sikri and Sneha Choudhry, ZoloStays operates in ten cities servicing about 50,000 people by having tie-up with over 500 builders, property owners and large developers. This would be doubled to 20 cities with the company serving one million people in the next two to three years.
The firm had already raised $35 million through three rounds of funding. 
The last round of funding was led by existing investor Nexus Venture Partners and IDFC Alternatives. The company is planning to raise $100 million to fund its expansion plans and investments in technology and talent.
The Bengaluru-based start-up serves as a market place for property solutions such as paying guest accommodation, service apartments and independent flats. It deploys Internet of Things for electricity and water billing in its properties.

Indian filmmaker Bauddhayan Mukherji chosen for L’Atelier programme ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/indian-filmmaker-bauddhayan-mukherji-chosen-for-latelier-programme/article31032126.ece,"Indian filmmaker Bauddhayan Mukherji has made it to the list of 16 directors chosen for Cinefondation’s prestigious L’Atelier programme at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The festival will be held from May 12 to 23 and the L’Atelier programme runs from May 14-21. Mr. Mukherji heads to the French Riviera with his upcoming project Marichjhapi.
Now in its 16th year, the programme brings together filmmakers with promising projects, along with their producers, and industry professionals, producers, distributors and potential partners, in Cannes. The idea is to provide access to the international co-productions circuit, and opportunities for international financing and investment for the speedy completion of films.
Mr. Mukherji is an advertisement and feature film director based in Mumbai. His filmography includes Bengali film Teenkahon (‘Three obsessions’) and the Hindi film The Violin Player. Both these films were self-produced under Little Lamb Films, a boutique production house he runs with poet and filmmaker Monalisa, who also happens to be his wife.
Marichjhapi, written by Mr. Mukherji and Abhinandan Banerjee, is the first film that they found too big and ambitious to self-finance and have gone out and sought co-producers for. “It’s a new feeling. Till now, we haven’t been answerable to anyone,” said Mr. Mukherji. The Atlanta-based American production house, Splendid Films, is already on board and Mr. Mukherji hopes that L’Atelier will help start “European conversations” and for the project go a “little more international”.
Marichjhapi was one of the new projects introduced at the Busan International Film Festival’s Asian Project Market in October 2019. It was then that actor Adil Hussain also came on board. Set in the Marichjhapi in the Sunderbans in January 1979, it is based on real incidents of atrocities and violence heaped on refugees to the island. If all falls into place, Mr. Mukherji intends shooting in January-February 2021. According to him, the film can’t be shot any time before that. “Sunderbans in winters is very different from how it is in summers,” he explained.
Cinefondation was created under the aegis of the Cannes Film Festival to inspire and support the next generation of international filmmakers. Its L’Atelier programme started in 2005 to stimulate creative filmmaking and to encourage the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers. So far, out of 233 projects, 171 have been released in theatres and 14 are currently in pre-production. This year, including Marichjhapi from India, there will be 15 projects representing 15 countries — China, Columbia, Egypt, Greece, India, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Netherlands, Philippines, Romania, United Kingdom, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey and Yemen.",movies

The song, which is a kuthu number, has been composed by Anirudh Ravichander and sung by the composer along with Gana Balachander, who has also written the lyrics. The duo also feature in the video of the song that has been released.
 




 
It was also announced recently that a grand audio launch for Master would take place on March 15.
However, unlike Vijay’s earlier films when huge stadiums were booked to house all his fans for the occasions, due to the coronavirus scare, the event has been organised at a hotel with limited seating for guests to avoid congregation of large crowds. The audio launch will have a live telecast on Sun Television channel from 6:30 pm onwards.
There is talk that a surprise performance will happen on stage to make up for fans missing the event.
Meanwhile, the first single from the album, Kutti Story has racked up 30 million views since the time of its release. The rest of the album will be released at the audio launch event.
Besides Vijay, Master also stars Vijay Sethupathi as the antagonist and others like Malavika Mohanan, Andrea Jeremiah, Shanthanu Bhagyaraj, Arjun Das, Gouri Kishan and Ramya Subramanian.

Kamal Haasan is too busy to give me a call: Gnanavel Raja,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kamal-haasan-is-too-busy-to-give-me-a-call-gnanavel-raja/article31031264.ece,"Gnanavel Raja is a man who bets on his instincts. The 50:50 success-failure ratio attached to such a business model is something he is aware of. It is this strategy that brought him the highs of a Singam (2010) or Madras (2014) but also took him to the lows of a NOTA (2018) or Mr Local (2019).
“It is all part of the trade,” says Gnanavel Raja, adding, “We enjoy the good things, don’t we? So we have to be prepared to face the bad as well.”
Things may be starting to turn a corner as the man behind the Studio Green production firm now has his feet wet with two big projects: Suriya’s next film with Hari titled Aruvaa, and the Shakti Soundar Rajan fantasy-revenge-action film, Teddy, starring Arya, whose teaser releases today. There is also Vaibhav’s Katteri, which he is pushing for a March 27 release, and another project with Suriya to be helmed by Siva that is expected to begin production in September 2020, after Siva completes Rajinikanth’s Annaatthe.
Excerpts from a conversation:
Why reunite with Hari?
 It is a very interesting project. This is Suriya and Hari’s sixth film together and my fourth film with Hari.

When the Singam series started, their combination went on a different trip. But along the way, the family, emotions and relationship elements went missing from it. With Aruvaa, Hari is back into that mould. From whatever I have heard (script), I can say that the film is a mix of Vel (2007) and Kadaikutty Singam (2018).
Is this the ‘Viswasam’ effect that has now got to Suriya as well?
Viswasam worked big because of the emotions in the subject. We believe the audience is open to films that portray relationship issues within a family, their camaraderie etc. In Aruvaa, the focus will be between brothers.
The ‘trend’ that everyone says Viswasam started... it is actually Hari’s format. When you see a Thaamirabharani (2007), Vel or Venghai (2011), these films had more drama, the focus was on relationships with family members like an aunt or a sister. Hari stepped out of that once Singam started... his films came to be all about ‘mass’. He is back on track with Aruvaa. It also won’t have the touch of earlier Hari-Suriya films.
You mean to say we can expect a Hari film that is not ‘loud’?
(smiles) Aruvaa won’t be loud. It will be more settled than his other films. Vel was not too ‘loud’ either.
Why choose the title Aruvaa? 
It gives a rural feel, and an aruvaa (sickle) is used in all of Hari’s films (laughs). It may be the reason but the option was given by the director. Knowing the story, I think it is an apt title.
You speak of trade being a roller coaster ride. Hasn’t Suriya been on one too?






Suriya

Every star goes through their good and bad patches. Suriya went through a bad patch but with Soorarai Pottru, which looks promising, he will come back 100 per cent.
As an established distributor, why do you think issues like the one that happened with Darbar crop up?
All technicians and artistes demand a price they feel they are qualified for and producers also pay that money because they think they stand to gain business out of their stardom. When a film fails... for example, think of it as buying a footwear for ₹20 and ₹5,000, and what happens when it is damaged in a day. If it is a cheap slipper, you will throw it away and buy a better one. What if it is an expensive shoe? Wouldn’t you go and demand compensation? That’s what happened with Darbar.
How does that make it okay to ask actors for compensation?
Legally speaking, it is not fair to ask the artistes or technicians for compensation when a big film fails. But if you look at it case-by-case, here the film’s producer had also incurred losses. So, for the actor and director to pay heed to [compensation] calls is purely a moral decision they need to make.
A workaround would be for the distributor to watch a film before choosing to invest in it so as to avoid losses, right?
A distributor has no option of seeing the film and buying. It is not given, especially for big films.
Why so?
It is not needed also. How qualified is the person watching it to decide the film’s worth and understand its potential? He can watch after he puts up the money (smiles). As a producer, say I have invested ₹40 crore in something, how can I open and show it to someone who has not even put a penny into it? I can’t do that.

So the film distribution business is essentially a ‘betting game’?
Yes. But it depends what or on who you are betting on. Are you betting on the director or the actor? No one bets on the producer. If tomorrow, Lyca funds a smaller film, would distributors line up to buy it off them? Even if they come, will they buy it for the price of Darbar? So, the point of distributors buying a film for the banner’s name is moot. 
Darbar issue boils down to the pricing, then?
The history of a star’s previous films and the business it has done is what sets the demand. The demand from theatres matter. In the case of Darbar, it was the wrong equation. Had they sold the film based on Petta’s business, the losses would not have been this huge and distributors would not have come asking for a refund. The mistake is on both parties.
Could stars reducing salaries or taking back-end payments help minimise the disastrous effects of a failure?
Reduction of salaries won’t happen. There is always some producer who is willing to front the fee a star demands. Back-end payments... it has started in Mumbai. I’m sure in another five or six years, it will become commonplace in South. It is a profitable system because as producers, we are saving on the interest component, which, otherwise, a third person called the financier keeps taking away. Removing that alone will add to the profits of a film.
That’s what every producer says...
Finance rates is the problem with cinema. It has got nothing to do with any individual lender. If the industry starts operating on bank interest rates, almost all films will become profitable.
But banks don’t lend often to film producers... not often, at least. 
Look, this is the best business to fund. What other options do they have? Real estate? That guy is at the mercy of market fluctuations. There is no time limit on those investments.

But cinema is not like that. The product has to be released in an eight month to one year period. The borrower will come forward to settle dues because a film is not like land, where the value keeps rising as the borrower and lender battle it out in courts. Only upon settlement can a film be released.
Banks can draw up mandatory conditions, seek collateral property and put teams on this to monitor loans. Banks should recognise our business as an industry. 
You were on the TFPC board for a while. Why didn’t you take the issue up with banks?
My team didn’t let me do it. We had lots of nonsense in the team. That is why I quit. I promised I would leave if I couldn’t get things done and I did as promised. I am happy that the bad name is not on me.
Finally, you never did respond to Kamal Haasan’s denial of your accusation that his firm RKFI took ₹10 crore from you for Uttama Villain...
I have yet to respond. I didn’t want to respond then because I felt my time was not good. But I will take this up legally.
Look, the issue is simple. We invested ₹10 crore on the guarantee of the late Chandrahasan. We have the guarantee statement on his letterhead with us, and he has given us certain commitments.

Wasn’t Thirrupati Brothers and N Lingusamy the ones who purchased the film on first copy basis from Kamal Haasan?
Yes, and then Lingusamy entered into a continuation agreement with me. Chandrahasan sir knows this. He was there in the TFPC meeting and knows the investment came from my end and which is why he gave me the letter. Maybe, somebody is misguiding Kamal sir.
If Chandrahasan sir was alive, I’d have met him and clarified the situation.
Hasn’t Kamal spoken to you?
Oh, he is busy with politics, and you know how my number is very difficult to get through... (smiles)",movies

Gleeson has been announced among the cast members for Out of Her Mind, a BBC comedy from comedian Sara Pascoe which has Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on board as executive producers, reports variety.com.
The news of Gleeson’s casting comes after he had previously hinted that he might give up acting as a career.
The series explores heartbreak, family issues and how to survive them both. The show will look to subvert the traditional sitcom format by combining eccentric characters, animation, and scientific explanation.
“Out Of Her Mind is a direct expression of my mind. We’ve turned my brain into a theme park, and everyone’s invited,” said Pascoe, adding: “The cast are incredible and I can’t wait for people to see what we’ve made.”
Gleeson’s screen credits include a cameo in Batman Begins. On TV front, his four-season run as Joffrey, which ended in spectacularly poisonous fashion, is his only credit.

Kerala clamps down on public gatherings as COVID-19 resurfaces 
A joint meeting of the the trade bodies representing the exhibitors, producers, technicians and distributors was held after the government imposed major restrictions on public gatherings across the State following the spike in COVID-19 cases.  Mr. Renjith said that the shooting of nearly 20 Malayalam films was progressing at various locations in the State. 
""We have asked the producers of these movies to take a call on whether to suspend the work based on the health scenario prevailing at the various shooting locations,"" he said. The meeting decided that the movies that were enjoying a good run at the box-office till Tuesday will get a chance to continue screening once the cinemas open following the temporary shut down.
The big-budget release in Kerala this March was to be director Priyadarshan and Mohanlal’s Marakkar Lion of the Arabian Sea, which also stars a huge ensemble cast.
The film traces the life of the naval chief captain of the Zamorin of Calicut (present name Kozhikode) Kunjali Marakkar IV, who is essayed by Mohanlal, and is based on the 16th century warrior who mobilized the country’s first naval force to battle the Portuguese invasion.
Another film to have a delayed release will be Tovino Thomas-starrer Kilometers and Kilometers, a comedy movie, which is written and directed by Jeo Baby.
However, now the release of the historical epic will be postponed. Further, if the situation escalates, April releases like the Tamil films — Vijay’s Master and Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru — will also not release in Kerala.
Distributors also said that there has been a major dip in collections in the past two days, especially in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam, where COVID-19 cases were reported. They added that the respective directors of Malayalam films can take a call on whether shooting of ongoing films have to continue.
After reopening the theatres, the release priority will be for the March releases as per the initial discussion with producers, say the distributors in the industry.

Directed by Lakshman, Bhoomi, which is Ravi’s 25th film, looks to be a film that takes up the plight of farmers and farmlands. The teaser begins with Ravi at a conference taking place in an international location where he says, “We have created a new home... Mars.” This scene followed by shots of farmlands going dry due to water scarcity seems to suggest that Ravi plays the role of a scientist who helps bring water back to aid farming. With Vande Maataram echoing in the background, we see Ravi with a spade in his hand, driving the tractor and ploughing the field and standing shoulder-to-shoulder alongside farmers as they express their gratitude to him for helping them out of a situation. We also get to see action sequences where the angry hero pummels the anti-socials. Bhoomi is set for a May release.
 




 
Meanwhile, Teddy has a dark undertone as it begins with a voice over by Magizh Thirumeni, who plays the antagonist, before we see a bearded Arya in a montage shot fighting a handful of people ranging from a hospital attendant to a security guard. The teaser then reveals the fantasy element of this film directed by Shakti Soundar Rajan of Tik Tik Tik fame, when a CGI teddy bear shows up on screen.

 Kaushik defeated Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside 4-1 to make the cut for Tokyo 2020 after a draining showdown which left the Australian with a bloodied face and the Indian exhausted by painful hits to his ribs.
 It was a repeat of the 2018 CWG final, only this time, Kaushik ended up on the winning side. The top six in the 63kg category were entitled to Olympic berths in the ongoing event. Both Kaushik and Garside had lost in the quarterfinals.
“It was my dream to play at the Olympics and today it has finally come true for me and my family. My coaches have made a huge contribution in this,” Kaushik, an Armyman, said after the win. 
 The other Indians to have qualified for Tokyo Olympics are MC Mary Kom (51kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg). 
 Before this, India’s best qualifying number for an Olympic Games was eight for the 2012 edition in London. That too was achieved over more than one qualifying tournament. 
 However, in a disappointing result, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) was pummelled by Shabbos Negmatulloev of Tajikistan in his box-off final to bow out of contention for an Olympic place at this event.
 Earlier, Olympic-bound Commonwealth Games champion Krishan signed off with a silver medal after an eye injury forced him to pull out of the final on Wednesday.
 Krishan, a world and Asian medallist, was to take on Jordan’s Zeyad Eashash in the summit clash.
“He will not compete because of the cut. He has been told by the doctors to pull out,” a source close to the boxer told PTI.
 Krishan had defeated second seed Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist, in the semifinals on Tuesday.
He sustained a cut on his left eyelid in the second round of the bout before claiming a split decision victory. ",other sports
Coronavirus effect: No fans allowed in India Open ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-effect-no-fans-allowed-in-india-open/article31039742.ece," The India Open Super 500 tournament, a crucial event for the Tokyo Olympic qualification, will be held without any spectators due to the global novel coronavirus outbreak, Badminton Association of India (BAI) said on Wednesday.
 The USD 400,000 tournament was under threat in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed over 4000 lives and infected more than 100,000 people globally.
 However, BAI and the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Wednesday issued a joint statement, making it clear that the event will go ahead as originally planned adding that precautionary measures will be taken for the smooth conduct of the tournament.
“The YONEX-SUNRISE India Open 2020 to be staged in New Delhi from 24-29 March will go ahead as planned,” the statement said.
“Enhanced precautionary measures will be in place to ensure the welfare and safety of players, their entourage and officials.” 
One of the precautions taken by the organisers is to restrict the entry of people inside the stadium.
“The India Open will be held as planned at the KD Jadhav stadium in Indira Gandhi Indoor stadium but to ensure safety of everybody we have decided not to allow any spectator this time,” BAI General Secretary, Ajay K. Singhania told PTI.
“Fans can watch the matches on youtube for the initial days while Hotstar will show the matches from quarterfinal onwards,” he said.
 The cornavirus outbreak has already forced the postponement of four Olympic qualifying badminton events so far — Lingshui China Masters (February 25 to March 1), Vietnam International Challenge (24-29 March 24-29), German Open (March 3 to 8) and Polish Open (March 26-29).
 Given the health hazard, the Indian government has suspended all regular visas/e-visas granted on or before March 3 to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan who have not yet entered India.
 The government has also made a 14-day quarantine mandatory for the people coming from Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy to India.
 According to the advisory, passengers arriving directly or indirectly from China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan must undergo medical screening at the port of entry.
 The draw of the Indian Open includes shuttlers from most of these countries, including a number of top Chinese players such as He Bingjiao, Shi Yu Qi and Lin Dan, who were cleared to participate in upcoming BWF World Tour tournaments in Europe.
 The BWF and BAI said it has reached the decision to host the event after “BAI consulted experts over the past few days regarding advisories issued by health authorities in India.” 
“BWF accepts that all relevant health, safety and logistical risks have been considered in this process,” the statement read.
 After India Open, the Malaysia Open World Tour Super 750 (March 31-April 5) and Singapore Open World Tour Super 500 (April 7-12) are the only two major events which fall inside the April 28 deadline for Olympic qualification.
Many top players such as two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan, London bronze medallist Saina Nehwal and Rio Olympics quarterfinalist Kidambi Srikanth are racing against time to book their ticket to Tokyo.
 BWF reiterated that it “is continuing to monitor all official updates on COVID-19 with no change to the intention to stage other HSBC BWF World Tour or BWF-sanctioned tournaments at this time.” ",other sports

“The ISA proved to be the catalyst for its emergence in the last two decades. Indian squash today only awaits a World champion!"" he said.

How BingeIt uses AI to help cinema-lovers decide what to watch next,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/bingeit-app-by-awesome-labs-hyderabad-uses-artificial-intelligence/article31040767.ece,"When Sai Kiran Rathan used to browse streaming sites based on what to watch next, he did not realise how much time was getting wasted after a long day at work. One evening, last August , he saw a full 90 minutes go by in a flash, and called up his old friend Sai Kiran Alagundula to crib about his situation. The two had met in 2011 during the Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) programme, and kept in touch ever since so they became each other’s sounding boards for ideating. 
“The [aforementioned] situation might seem mundane to many,” Rathan avers, “But time is precious and who wouldn’t want to watch something just right for them? So we came together to form AwesomeLabs and started brainstorming how to go about this problem, which we knew many people were experiencing.”

Now based in Hyderabad, Rathan and Alagundula came up with BingeIt, a multi-device app, which leverages Artificial Intelligence to help users discover aggregated OTT content, while also building peer-to-peer recommendations. BingeIt also doubles as a social platform to connect friends and family who share similar interests.
By September, they had the initial prototype. The next three months, however picked up more pace with a beta stage including a closed group of testers. According to Rathan, developing the app took a few weeks longer than the duo’s goal timeline. “We had aimed for a Deepavali launch date to coincide with the holiday season, but things didn’t work out. With some last-minute coding, we readied ourselves for a January 2 launch date with Apple and Android compatibility.” 
Rathan undertakes the innovation and development side of BingeIt, while Alagundula oversees the business and marketing aspects.
The app, like most entertainment apps as of late, has a minimal two-tone aesthetic with a clutter-free user experience. There are currently six main sections including a static home page where recommendations show up on an infinite scroll screen. A section titled ‘Top Recommendations’ is divided into ‘My Circle’ and ‘Global’, the former changing its content depending on who you have in your friends list and the latter updating when new content is released across various streaming platforms. 






The ‘My Recommendations’ tab in BingeIt offers two schools of content, based on popularity and the user’s social circle on the app
 






So how is this different from, say, the ratings recommendations on Netflix? Rathan explains that these recommendations come from your friends, and people you may or may not know. It goes both ways; there is also the contrary situation where someone with ‘not so great’ taste in entertainment can prove something might not be to your liking. “The current user base for BingeIt is around 1,000 users, and 50 to 60 daily active users. We started seeing a lot of traction lately and adding new users every day. We haven't done any full scale activity yet, so the user base is purely organic and/or referred users.”
Rathan says that current users are spread across India and the US. “This was really helpful in testing. For example, we have Rick and Morty on Netflix in India, but the licensing model for Netflix USA does not have the show. So if I were to recommend this show to my friend there, it would not have the same streaming logo badges for them. That is one development I have been really particular about perfecting,” elaborates Rathan.






The landing page on BingeIt app offers recently-released recommendations
 






The social side of BingeIt allows users to create interest-based groups to organically (in some way) share movie or series picks. “This is still helping people stay in touch,” says Rathan, “and while we do have a strong AI, there’s nothing quite like having that trusted recommendation from someone you know, which is the core spirit of our app.” Each recommendation comes with the streaming logo badge (for Netflix, Hotstar and Amazon Prime) as per their availabilities. “We are looking forward to include more streaming platforms which the country keeps creating.”
There are quite a few features in the future of BingeIt, says Rathan. “We want to appeal to discerning cinema buffs, so we would like to have crew-specific projects come up; for example, films featuring cinematography by Roger Deakins. Right now, we can show recommendations by actor.”
It does not have in-app paid features yet, which Alagundula says could change in the near future. “Right now, we are focussed on user aggregation and seeing how people respond to our app.” Though the app is currently available on smartphones and iPads, AwesomeLabs want to bring a smart-TV compatibility to make streaming smoother. “We have so many other developments in the pipeline,” says Alagundula excitedly. “This is just the beginning.” 
(BingeIt by AwesomeLabs is available for free on both the App Store (Apple) and on Google Play (Android).Works on iOS 10.0.5+, Android Kitkat and above.)",technology

The shift to working at home option is not confined to large global corporations. PayTM, Zoho and many start-ups are asking their workers to work from home.
While employees at large firms have robust IT infrastructure that provide tools for productivity, communication, storage and security, those in smaller firms can use some of these tools to work efficiently at home.
First things first. With a patchy mobile network, it can get really hard to stay connected to the internet. As most work applications are accessed online, an uninterrupted broadband connection is an absolute must if you want to stay efficient at home.

Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-sentenced-to-23-years-in-prison/article31042543.ece,"Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison on March 11 following his sexual assault and rape conviction in February in a case hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.
The sentence was handed down in Manhattan criminal court by Justice James Burke, who presided over Weinstein’s trial. A jury on February 24 found Weinstein, 67, guilty of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann.

Once one of Hollywood’s most influential producers, Weinstein had faced the possibility of a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison.
During the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi asked judge Burke to impose 25 years or “near” 25 years in prison for his conviction on a charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree involving Ms. Haleyi and to impose a consecutive sentence for the third-degree rape conviction involving Ms. Mann. That charge called for up to four years in prison, but the prosecution made no specific request.

Hollywood reacts to Harvey Weinstein sentencing: ‘It’s the power of people who speak up’

Weinstein, wearing a suit, and the six women who testified against Weinstein were in court for the proceedings.
In an emotional statement in court, Ms. Haleyi spoke of the trauma she had endured since the attack, saying, “It scarred me deeply, mentally and emotionally, perhaps irreparably, perhaps forever.”
Prosecutors in court filings last week said the sentence should reflect not only the crimes of which he was convicted, but a “lifetime of abuse towards others”.
More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, fuelling the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment. Weinstein has denied the allegations and said that any sex was consensual.
The jury of seven men and five women acquitted Weinstein on the most serious charges, a single count of first-degree rape as well as two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence. Those charges relied on testimony by actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s.
Weinstein’s lawyers on March 9 urged judge Burke to impose the minimum possible sentence of five years, asking him to consider Weinstein’s charitable activities while saying a longer sentence would likely mean Weinstein would die in prison.
“His life story, his accomplishments, and struggles are simply remarkable and should not be disregarded in total because of the jury’s verdict,” they said.",entertainment

Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison

The list was part of about 1,000 pages of documents that were unsealed at the New York criminal courthouse, ahead of Weinstein’s sentencing on Wednesday.
The document was brought up during Weinstein’s seven-week trial, but only accuser Annabella Sciorra’s name was revealed to be on the list. The lead prosecutor requested that the list, which included both men and women, to be provided to the jury so they could see all of the names, but the judge denied that plea.
Around 70 names are on the list, including Affleck and Sciorra, in addition to accusers Rose McGowan, Zelda Perkins, Lysette Anthony and Rowena Chiu.
Also on the list are former Weinstein Company executive Irwin Reiter, Weinstein’s former assistant and Russian Doll creator Leslye Headland and producers Megan Ellison, Donna Gigliotti, Jason Blum and Jennifer Todd.
During the trial, a private investigator testified that he was approached directly by Weinstein to investigate the names on the list, specifically Sciorra.
On the stand, the private investigator said he received an email from Weinstein with an attachment that was referred to as the Red Flag List, which was a document with names and information about those people.
“The red flags are the first to call,” Weinstein wrote in the email to the private investigator.
The private investigator also said that he did not conduct the investigation, and was unsure if the investigation was ever completed by another detective.
Affleck rose to stardom with 1997’s Good Will Hunting — a film released by Weinstein’s former company, Miramax.
The Red Flag List was one of many documents unearthed in the unsealed court papers, which included several emails, including a nasty message about Jennifer Aniston, and many desperate pleas to powerful people, including Michael Bloomberg and Jeff Bezos, to help save his career.",entertainment

Mr. Soman recalls going to the local ‘shakha’, or training centre, at the Shivaji Park in Mumbai. He writes that his father “was a great believer in the benefits that would accrue to a young boy, in terms of disciplined living, physical fitness and right thinking, from being part of the junior cadres of the RSS”, reports theprint.in.
Mr. Soman adds that being part of an RSS shakha was “a very Shivaji Park thing” for a young boy to do back then.
He writes how “baffled” he feels today when he reads of “all the subversive, communal propaganda the media attributes to RSS shakhas.” Adding that his memories “of what went on at the shakhas every evening are completely different,” Mr. Soman recalls how activities included marching in khaki shorts, yoga, games, camping trips, songs and chanting Sanskrit verses “that we did not understand.”
All activities, Mr. Soman recalls, were supervised by a “team of mostly well-meaning if not always inspirational adults who truly believed they were helping raise good ‘civilian soldiers’.”
According to theprint.in, Mr. Soman recalls that his father had been part of the RSS himself and was a proud Hindu. “I didn’t see what there was to be proud about, but on the other hand, I didn’t see that there was much to complain about either,” he writes in his memoir.",entertainment
Event planners across India now help you plan parties for any occasion,https://www.thehindu.com/society/check-out-these-surprise-planners-across-india/article31041055.ece,"You’ve heard of birthday surprises and dramatic wedding proposals but have you heard of a break-up surprise? Sounds a tad cruel but the intention is all good, or so we are told. 
Honestly, surprise planners have seen it all. “A woman wanted me to plan a surprise where she could apologise to her former partner. For another client, we arranged a guitarist and a singer who sang his ex’s favourite songs for her,” says Sakthivel Pannerselvam who started The6.in, a surprise planning and gifting platform, in 2009. 
A Mechanical Engineering graduate, and the first generation to get educated in his family, Sakthivel says it took him months of brainstorming before deciding to set up this business. 
“I felt that this business needed less investment. I saw a few videos of surprises abroad and went ahead with the plan.” It started small with gifts such as personalised calendars and coffee mugs. “Being a new business model, I didn’t have anyone to follow. I didn’t know how much to price services. I learnt on the go,” he says. In the process mistakes were made and losses incurred. “I can now write a book on how not to surprise people,” he laughs.

Though based out of Chennai, today, The6.in’s services are available across the country, primarily in cities in Tamil Nadu such as Coimbatore, Namakkal and Tirunelveli. People in Namakkal have expensive taste, he observes. “Their surprises cost around 3 lakh,” he says narrating an elaborate one where a couple went up in a crane, 100 feet above the ground, and when the lady looked down she could see ‘I love you’ illuminated across the field below, and firecrackers that read ‘Marry Me’.
The entire episode lasted five minutes, had 65 people working on it and cost ₹2.5 lakh. Another had a space decorated with an archway of lights, based on a scene from the Tamil movie Remo. “The fiancée jumped in joy and cried. For the fiancé it was well worth 3.5 lakh,” says Sakthivel.
In the last 10 years Sakthivel has also noticed a pattern. “70% of women who are married organise surprises for their husbands. When it comes to men, 80% of single men plan surprises for their girlfriends,” he laughs. While there are a lot of fun events that he plans, those involving parents (70th birthday, retirement) almost always end up being emotional. From simple roses and a box of balloons to elaborate flash mobs and yacht adventures, The6.in receives around 80 to 100 orders in a month.

 Naadia Mirza Daga, who in 2009 started Bengaluru-based Dotted I that specialises in quirky gifts and ideas, says, “A decade ago, the demand for these things were less as people were not aware that you could gift an experience. Today, they want to give more than just materialistic gifts,” she says. 
Which explains why, in 2017, she incorporated the surprise gifting concept into her brand. She receives 90 orders per month, averaging three surprises per day. Her range is diverse: from a golgappa vendor turning up at your doorstep and challenging you to 100 pani puris or scaring your friends at a designated spot, to a picnic in the park and a naughty 40th birthday party. “The most over-the-top one we planned so far was a 50th birthday where we got someone to dress up as an ostrich and hold the cake, flew in a standup comedian from Delhi and painted a wall depicting the birthday boy in different avatars,” says Naadia.







According to Shahul Hameed of city-based Surprise Machi that launched in 2016, a person booked a surprise which was to be delivered to himself. “And while placing the order the client said “Surprise nalla pannidunga,” laughs Shahul, who’s repertoire includes public pranks, cabanas by the bay, personalised song recordings, sailing and ATV Rides among others. With the increase in demand, his team too has grown to 17 people from having just one person last July. “With customers throwing novel challenges at us, we have meetings everyday to constantly keep coming up with new ideas,” he says.

Surely, the business of gifting surprises is not as glamorous as it seems. “It requires plan Bs, loads of to-do sheets and Post-its,” laughs Naadia. Sometimes, convincing a client can be a task. They may find a task too simple and not understand the level of execution it requires. “People like the personal touch. And it is essential to get the timing right,” opines Sakthivel. While Naadia feels, “You genuinely need to love people and care for their emotions to be able to make them happy.”",society

"RBL, KVB allay fears on financial health",https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbl-kvb-allay-fears-on-financial-health/article31043364.ece,"Private sector lenders RBL Bank and Karur Vysya Bank (KVB) have sought to ally concerns of investors and depositors in the wake of the Yes Bank saga.
The RBL Bank has clarified that the lender was well capitalised, with a strong governance set up in the aftermath of the Yes Bank crisis to address concerns over its financial health.
“The bank remains adequately capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 16.08% with tier-1 at 15.02%, significantly higher than the prescribed regulatory requirement of 11.5% and 9.5% respectively.” RBL said.
The bank has also said there has been no material adverse change in the asset quality since its the third quarter financial results which were announced on January 22, 2020 and its guidance remains consistent.
“Our Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is at 145% of statutory requirements as at the end of last week,” the bank said while adding all the business segments are doing well, it continue to expand presence across newer geographies by adding branches and also hiring more people as previously planned. The bank continues to attract additional deposits from retail, corporates and institutional segments, it said.
“We wish to re-emphasize that RBL Bank is a fundamentally strong institution. Rumours around financial health and stability of the institution especially in social media seem to be misplaced, motivated and not based on facts,” RBL Bank said.
The 104-year-old KVB is a profitable and well-capitalised bank with a strong commitment to protect customer interests, according to the bank’s MD and CEO P.R. Seshadri. 
According to him, the bank’s Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio stands at 15.87% as of December 2019 against the regulatory requirement of 10.875%. It has a liquidity coverage ratio of 306.23% against a regulatory requirement of 100%. This indicates very high level of liquidity to meet any obligations, he said.
 Meanwhle, the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group said it had no direct or indirect exposure to Rana Kapoor, former MD and CEO of Yes Bank, or his wife or daughters or any entities controlled by Mr. Kapoor or his family.
The Reliance Group said its entire exposure to Yes Bank was fully secured and transacted in ordinary course of business.
“Reliance Group is committed to honor repayments of all its borrowings from YBL through its various asset monetization programmes which are all at advanced stages,” the statement added. ",business
Supply chain problems hamper auto production,https://www.thehindu.com/business/supply-chain-problems-hamper-auto-production/article31043311.ece,"Automobile production across all categories, including that of passenger vehicles and two-wheelers, is likely to be ‘critically’ hampered due to supply chain disruption as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in China, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Stating that many automakers in India import about 10% of their raw materials from China, Rajan Wadhera, president at SIAM, said that the disruption in availability of these parts is likely to critically hamper production across all segments including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three-wheelers and two-wheelers. The disruption will ‘gravely’ affect electric vehicle production, Mr. Wadhera added.
The auto industry, he added, had maintained inventory at the beginning of the year in anticipation of the Chinese New Year. 
However, with the current lock-down in China, supplies for BS-VI vehicles are likely to be impacted. “Manufacturers are exploring alternatives to fulfil their supply chain demands, but that would also take a substantial [period] of time to reach stable production scale as these components would need regulatory testing,” Mr. Wadhera added.",business
Pesticide sector hit by input issues ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pesticide-sector-hit-by-input-issues/article31043301.ece,"The Indian pesticide industry is heavily dependent on Chinese imports for raw materials, and could be heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, according to an analysis prepared by the Agriculture Ministry.
The Ministry estimates that domestic inventories may be sufficient for the kharif sowing season, but any further supply disruptions could hurt farmers. Industry insiders and analysts say that a good rabi or winter crop season and the possibility of a locust attack could deplete inventories sooner than expected, raising prices by about 15%.
“Pesticide industry in India heavily depends on import of around 15 technical insecticides from China,” says the analysis submitted to the Finance Ministry last week as part of an overall assessment of the impact of the virus outbreak on Indian industries. Technical insecticides are an intermediate product used in the manufacture of commercial pesticides.
“Out of the 15 pesticides, Acephate, Cartap, Buprofezin, Pretilachlor represent 80-90% trade from China whereas Imidacloprid, Azoxystrobinb, Imzathapyr, Acetamiprid represent 40-50% import from China. Few technical insecticides, which are manufactured in India, also involve the raw material, which is sourced from China,” says the analysis, accessed by The Hindu.
“There is a major supply gap, as no container has come from China in the last two months. In fact, it started in early January when factories were shut for their New Year festival, and then, there was the coronavirus,” says Rajesh Aggarwal, MD, Insecticides India. 
“We understand they are now back up to about 40% production capacity, which has restarted in March. But there are still barriers on internal movement in China, plus [delays in] shipping out of China. So, the gap has built up, availability is very tight and now, prices have gone crazy.”
 He estimated that there had been a 10-25% increase in the cost of these inputs from China. According to the Ministry analysis, the impact on farmers may not be immediate. “Functioning of domestic pesticides industries may not be affected immediately by the disruption of supplies from China since the industry in India is having inventories for at least next six months. Hence, for the ongoing kharif season, there may not be any adverse effect on the availability of pesticides to the Indian farmers,” it said.
However, Mr. Aggarwal said inventories are lower than usual for this season because of excellent rains extending the rabi season in parts of the country. 
He estimated a 15% rise in the wholesale price of pesticides. Ratings and research agency Crisil also raised some red flags, although it felt that the procurement season for the rabi season is largely over. “In case the manufacturing facilities do not operationalise by end of February, there could be some impact in procuring raw material for the upcoming kharif season,” said an early impact report.
Crisil Research director Hetal Gandhi added that the news of a locust attack in the region could increase demand and deplete stocks. 
“May is peak season for stocking, and there may be a 15-20 day delay,” she said, noting that delays in dispatches was the major concern. “The first quarter of the year accounts for 35% of revenue for Indian pesticide companies, so, if the raw material does not reach in time, there could be significant impact.” As India imports only 10% of its urea from China, as well as value-added fertilisers, this could also have a moderate impact on Indian farmers, she said.
Mr. Aggarwal, who is also vice-chairman, Crop Care Federation of India, urged the Centre to issue faster clearances for imports and also facilitate manufacturing licences so that India can become self-sufficient here. “We need to use this opportunity to backward integrate and put up capacity, so that we are not dependent on imports,” he said.
Pesticides Manufacturers & Formulators Association of India president Pradip Dave agreed. “As manufacturing and logistics are paralysed in China, it’s a good time for India to increase its share in global markets. The government must help local manufacturing companies by granting registration from the Central Insecticide Board and manufacturing licences by States,” he said. 
“They are being slow and lethargic and we may miss golden opportunities.”",business

RBI invites applications for Deputy Governor’s post,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-invites-applications-for-deputy-governors-post/article31043258.ece,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has invited applications from its Executive Directors for the Deputy Governor’s post as B.P. Kanungo, one of the four Deputy Governors, is scheduled to complete his three-year term in April.
There are 12 Executive Directors in the RBI at present. To be eligible for the Deputy Governor’s post, a candidate must be below 60 years. 
RBI has four Deputy Governors, of which two are promoted from within the ranks of RBI. Mr. Kanungo’s replacement will come from the RBI. Of the other two, one is an economist and the other is a commercial banker. Mr. Kanungo took over as the Deputy Governor of RBI on April 3, 2017. He had a three-year term. 
As Deputy Governor, he was looking after departments like currency management, payments and settlement, foreign exchange department, internal debt management, among others. Mr. Kanungo, a career central banker, joined the Reserve Bank of India in September 1982. 
He has worked in several functional areas of the bank such as foreign exchange management, banking amd non-banking supervision, currency management, government and bank accounts and public debt. 
Sources said while the RBI had started the process to find a successor for Mr. Kanungo, there was a possibility that he may be given an extension by the government. The Deputy Governors of RBI are appointed by the government. “He can get an extension though RBI had to start the process of finding a replacement,” said a source. Another Deputy Governor N.S.

‘Allow temporary write-down of Yes Bank’s additional tier 1 bonds’ ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/allow-temporary-write-down-of-yes-banks-additional-tier-1-bonds/article31043238.ece,"The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to allow fund houses a temporary write down of additional tier 1 bonds of Yes Bank to avoid a huge hit on the net asset value of schemes that hold such bonds. 
The industry body wrote to the banking regulator after the proposed restructuring scheme of the troubled private sector bank mentioned that such bonds would be permanently written off. “As an industry body, we have written to both RBI and SEBI,” said AMFI chief executive N.S. Venkatesh during a media call on Wednesday. “We have written before the cut-off date [for submitting comments] of the restructuring scheme of Yes Bank. Our comments have been given. Now they will examine it,” he added.
This assumes significance as many fund houses including, Nippon India Mutual Fund, Kotak Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, among others, stand to lose thousands of crores if the additional tier 1 bonds are completely written off. Such bonds, known as AT1 bonds in market parlance, are perpetual bonds issued by banks to meet their long-term capital requirements. Interestingly, such bonds typically do have a call option after five years and hence if the central bank allows a temporary write down, the fund houses may still be able to stem the potential losses if the valuation of the bank improves after restructuring.
Meanwhile, the total assets under management (AUM) of the industry registered a marginal dip in February with the assets falling to ₹27.23 lakh crore from ₹27.86 lakh crore in January. 
Going ahead, industry players expect the ongoing volatility to affect mutual fund flows to a certain extent. 
“We expect continued buoyancy in SIP flows in March too, though a few institutional investors may reassess their investment strategy, given the deep correction in markets,” said Mr. Venkatesh. ",business

We expect our quarterly earnings to be materially impacted because of the above,” the airline said in its filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Since January, the airline has cancelled its operations to Chengdu, Guangzhuo and Hong Kong in China, as well as reduced its frequencies to several destinations in the southeast Asia.
The airline has told the BSE that while it was able to initially redeploy aircraft freed up to other destinations and protect its revenue from any material harm, it was unable to do so any more as the passenger demand itself had taken a hit in the past few days.

Before that, Saudi Arabia barred non-Saudis from entering the kingdom and suspended the tourist visa for the religious pilgrims to Mecca. This meant that the short-haul international market for Indian carriers to the country's west and east have both been impacted.
In what could be termed a double whammy, the airline also said that the sharp depreciation in rupee would hit the airline and its dollar denominated liabilities primarily because of the large number of planes it has on rent from foreign lessors.

Radhika Madan on playing Tarika in 'Angrezi Medium': 'We both can't stop dreaming',https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/radhika-madan-on-playing-tarika-in-angrezi-medium-we-both-cant-stop-dreaming/article31042769.ece,"Actor Radhika Madan asked for the question to be repeated. This time around, she peeled her eyes off of the recorder – “it’s so old-school!” – to return to our tête-à-tête. But as director Homi Adajania kicked off his interview, he mischievously chuckled and eerily predicted its malfunctioning. During their chats with The Hindu at the Santa Cruz West Maddock Films office, the actor and director discussed their upcoming film Angrezi Medium (AM), being storytellers, and their peculiar career trajectories.
After playing a badass martial artist in Vasan Bala’s Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota and one half of the warring Rajasthani sisters in Vishal Bhardwaj’s Pataakha, the 24-year-old Madan will be portraying a 17-year-old Tarika Bansal, the daughter of an Udaipuri mithaiwala (Irrfan Khan) who wants to study in London.
While there were whispers of Madan replacing a star kid for the role, Adajania shared he happened to chance upon her audition for Pataakha, “I had no clue who this girl was, but I was blown away by it.” As they discussed it, Madan asked to audition for AM, but Adajania seemed rather blasé having decided he was looking for a 16 or 17-year-old. “I saw her audition and there was no way I could say no,” he said, admitting that she didn’t stick out amongst a group of younger teenagers.
Madan felt that playing Tarika has been her toughest role yet. She rolled her eyes, knowing that people would likely disagree, “But I can’t relate to Tarika at all. I think the one thing that’s common between us, is that we can’t stop dreaming.”
In her endeavour to get into the schoolgirl’s shoes, the actor travelled to Udaipur, and spent time with teenagers who were giving their exams. “They would pick me up in their Scooty and go to their hangout spots – [near] Fateh Sagar [Lake] we would have kulhad-wali chai (tea in clay cups).” They spoke about boyfriends and travelling abroad, and Madan picked up the nuances and twangs in the English they spoke. But the actor shakes her head defeated while laughing and added, “All people are going to say is, ‘she looked cute and sweet!’”
With her two-year-old career in Hindi films, Madan’s filmography has almost caught up with Adajania’s – whose presence in the industry was marked with his 2006 debut, the Saif Ali Khan-starrer Being Cyrus. But the director is unbothered by the gaps between his releases – his last being the 2014 Finding Fanny. He shared that he takes on projects instinctively, “I make a film if I know it’s going to be a new and great experience [that will] put me out of my comfort zone. I made my first film because I didn’t know how to make a film. I made Cocktail (2012) because it was just not [of] my sensibilities and I thought ‘let me try this’. I made Finding Fanny because I wanted to make a picture book on love, loneliness and longing, and I wanted each frame to be edible.” On him why he chose to helm AM he said, “Because I’m looking at the world around me and I feel we need to make people laugh. [Not through] gags or slapstick, [but the film] needed to have a soul.”
Adajania also admitted that inevitably, experiences from his travels – whether the people he meets, or the bizarre experiences he survives – bleed into his films. When asked for a list of the craziest situations he has experienced, the effort to shortlist was evident. He mentioned being on a boat for a shark expedition that hit rocks and sank at 3 a.m., doing a diving course in Mauritius when he ran out of air at a depth of 120 feet, and going snowboarding – when he didn’t know how – before he had his first child, but landing up with a ripped collarbone and snow blindness. But he left it that, flustered that the 20 minutes allotted for the chat wouldn’t allow him to dive into detail of each story.






Director Homi Adajania
 






 
While Adajania decided to create Being Cyrus on a whim – just another thing to check off his bucket list, Madan’s beginnings in the industry were also rather accidental. After being discovered on Facebook, Madan took a leap of faith and moved to Mumbai to act in the television show Meri Aashiqui Tum Se Hi and it was after four months of its shooting through long hours that Madan discovered a love for acting. Despite the condescension small screen actors often face, Madan sees her background and its rigorous schedules as the place she learnt to hone her craft. Two separate accidental injuries with her dog – a burn and a bite – didn’t stop the show’s shooting. “They came home and took my close-up. Once I was bitten by my dog [around] my eye and they changed the script – the next day I had a kidnapping scene and got hit, so I shot with a bruised eye,” she shared.

‘I don’t play the best friend role any more’: Sumukhi Suresh on 'Pushpavalli',https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-dont-play-the-best-friend-role-any-more-sumukhi-suresh-on-pushpavalli/article31041438.ece,"Sumukhi Suresh greets me like an old friend on the phone. “We always speak during the highlight moments of my life,” she says. And there have been quite a few of those, including a stand-up special, judging a reality show for upcoming comics and, now, the second season of her Amazon Prime Video show, Pushpavalli.
Released in December 2017, the titular character is an introverted girl from Bhopal who moves all the way to Bengaluru to pursue (read stalk) a man she thinks is romantically interested in her. Written and played by 32-year-old Suresh, the show’s eight binge-worthy episodes had us rooting for Pushpavalli, even when the things she said or did were clearly not acceptable. “I wrote her as someone who is reserved, so viewers felt more sympathetic. At the end of season one, she is left embarrassed and treated badly by everyone around her. So she is in an irrational, vengeful place,” says Suresh.
The core cast remains the same, with Manish Anand (Nikhil Rao), Naveen Richard (Pankaj) and Ashok Pathak (T-Boi) reprising their roles. Actor Vidyuth Gargi is a new addition — a social media teaser shows him seated next to Pushpavalli in what looks like an engagement. “We wrote the script and character around [Gargi’s] quirks, so it felt more natural,” says Suresh. While she helms the writers’ room, Ayesha Nair (Adulting, What the Folks) and Sumaira Shaik (Son of Abish) are also part of the team, with Richard and director Debbie Rao giving inputs.
Ask what the show has done for her career at large, and she says, “Immediately, it didn’t do a lot for me. But over the past one year, I have noticed that a lot of people have discovered it, and come for my live events because of it.” She adds that people also now see her as someone who is able to play a lead, who can hold a scene by herself. “I don’t play the best friend role any more.”

On several instances, Suresh has mentioned that she doesn’t like being pigeonholed into the “woman comic” slot. Her aim is to be great at whatever she does, irrespective of gender. Being part of a reality show for stand-ups like Comicstaan, she is glad to see more women making their presence felt. “We should learn from men. Even when they fail, they move on. We tend to obsess. And on shows like this, a woman failing can seem like they have let down the entire gender. We need to move away from that mindset and focus on individual achievements,” she says. Suresh calls on women to fangirl more about other women, the way men do about practically anyone they admire, be it film stars or influencers. “Support them vocally, and even if you don’t like their work, make sure you give them feedback. That way, we know there is an audience that wants to listen to a female perspective.” All the feedback for her comedy (good or bad) started coming in only after she was in Pushpavalli.
Working with a largely female team for her début web series on a major platform such as Prime Video, Suresh admits that her intention was to tell a story for women. “I don’t mean to sound repetitive, but it’s a fact that we don’t give big girls such roles. There are no non-stereotypical traits on screen [in recent years]. No Nandita Das, Shabana Azmi or Smita Patil. When I got the chance to put out a face that is not typical, I took it, and it worked,” she explains. So when asked what happens if the second season doesn’t do as well as the first, she is prepared for it. “If it fails, it fails. I cannot do anything about it. I’ll just have to move on to the next project with lessons learnt.”
With experience in different forms of creative entertainment, which aspect does she enjoy the most? “Writing and acting, because it doesn’t feel like a chore,” she says. This explains why Suresh is currently working on three different scripts for web series, which will hopefully find producers soon. As for stand-up, she says, “I know somewhere I do it to prove a point. Not as much as before, but 20% of it is for this reason.”
Improv, which is where she started her career, is just a way of life now. “I apply it in every situation, even when we have a conflict in the writers’ room. It is also how I deal with the pressure to get married. What if I don’t find someone? Then I’ll just have to live by myself, which is not so bad,” she says. However, she warns against trying the ‘Yes, and’ method when you are on the edge of a cliff — “That will not end well,” she concludes with a laugh.
Season two of Pushpavalli is available on Amazon Prime Video from March 13.",movies
Coronavirus: Shoot of Disney+ series ‘Falcon And Winter Soldier’ shut down in Prague ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-shoot-of-disney-series-falcon-and-winter-soldier-shut-down-in-prague/article31041287.ece,"The shooting of the upcoming Falcon And Winter Soldier series has been shut down in Prague due to concerns over coronavirus.
The move comes after the Czech government placed a ban on movie screenings, elementary and high school classes, sports matches, and cultural events. The Prague Film Festival has also been cancelled, reports variety.com.
Falcon and Winter Soldier began filming in Prague last week, but the cast and crew have now been recalled to Atlanta.
This is the second time filming on the series has been interrupted. In January, the show was due to shoot in Puerto Rico, but was forced to postpone shooting after the commonwealth was hit by a series of powerful earthquakes.
Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are set to reprise their roles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the series, with Daniel Bruhl, Emily VanCamp, and Wyatt Russell also starring. The series will consist of six episodes and is due to be released on Disney+ in August.
The show is one of several limited series centred on MCU characters currently in the works at Disney+. Others are Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, Loki, She-Hulk, Moon Knight and WandaVision.",movies
Scarlett Johansson feels the ‘Black Widow’ movie wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/scarlett-johansson-feels-the-black-widow-movie-wouldnt-have-been-possible-10-years-ago/article31041260.ece,"Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson believes time is right for her stand-alone Black Widow film as she believes the movie wouldn’t have been as “substantial” if it released a decade ago.
 After 10 years and seven films of playing the Russian super-spy Avenger Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow, Johansson is set to star in a solo film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
 The film, directed by Cate Shortland, is a prequel set before the events of 2019 tentpole, Avengers: Endgame. 
Black Widow was the only female in the original Avengers. Johansson made her debut as the character in 2010’s Iron Man 2. 
“For anyone who said to me, ‘Oh, this should’ve happened five or 10 years ago,’ I’m like, it would not have been as substantial. We just would not have been able to do it. This film is happening now as a result of what’s going on in the zeitgeist, and I think it’s pretty cool,” Johansson told Entertainment Weekly.
 After Captain Marvel, the film is the second female superhero-led project in the MCU.
 Johansson said the world was ready for Black Widow while she was filming a fight scene alongside fellow female actors Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), among others in Endgame.
“I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren’t just Batman in heels or whatever,” she added.
 Also starring Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour, Black Widow will hit screens on April 30. ",movies

Wahl Street, a pun on American financial epicentre Wall Street, the HBO Max series will trace Wahlberg’s journey as a rapper-turned-actor who straddles his acting job with many other business ventures.
 The eight-episode docuseries is executive produced by Wahlberg, Stephen Levinson, Archie Gips, and Liz Bronstein, reported Entertainment Weekly.
 According to the WarnerMedia streaming service, each episode “will follow Wahlberg as he navigates his expansive business portfolio, spanning all sectors of commerce ranging from a line of activewear, all-natural, high-performance sports nutrition supplements, television and film production companies, and even a Chevrolet dealership.” 
The show will also feature entrepreneurs pitching ideas to Wahlberg.
“We’re documenting the ups, the downs, the hits and the misses. It’s all the real stuff that’s happening while I’m growing my businesses. We’re pulling back the curtain and hopefully it’s an opportunity to inspire other entrepreneurs,” said Wahlberg.
 Another HBO show, Entourage was loosely based on the actor’s life. He also served as an executive producer on the long-running comedy. ",movies
How is Kollywood dealing with the coronavirus outbreak in India?,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kollywood-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/article31041030.ece,"Is the film industry equipped to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak? Because, there seems to be a decline in terms of collection during weekdays. Tiger Shroff’s action-packed Baaghi 3 opened well across the country and has grossed ₹53.83 crore in its opening weekend. However, the trade feels that the movie could have performed much better if not for the Coronavirus fear. Closer home, the Tamil romantic-drama Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal grossed over ₹9 cr in 10 days, which is huge by any yardstick.
Hollywood took a hit because of the Coronavirus threat in countries like North America, South Korea, Japan, Europe and China. In fact, the much-awaited James Bond movie No Time To Die, which was scheduled for release on April 2, has been pushed to November. Peter Rabbit 2 is another movie to be postponed. Marvel’s Black Widow, however, will release as per its original plan on April 30. Meanwhile, the Malayalam industry has locked down theatres till March 31 as per the State Government’s request.
Reports suggest that some Hindi films might get postponed, as tweeted by well-known trade analyst Taran Adarsh. 
He wrote, “Rescheduling release dates of some forthcoming Hindi films is on the cards. With Coronavirus spreading far and wide, not just India theatrical business, the overseas theatrical business is also gradually turning cold.” The coming days are going to be crucial for the movie industry’s business. Speaking about this issue, Kamal Gianchandani, CEO of PVR Pictures, says, “We have been watching the box office trend for Baaghi 3 and other films. So far, there has not been a noticeable impact as box-office figures are concerned. It’s understandable that the producers would want to reassess their release strategy. However, the fact remains that not a single Indian film has been delayed.”
In Kollywood, meanwhile, four big ‘summer’ films are scheduled for release starting from Easter-Tamil New Year (April 9 weekend) to May Day (May 1 weekend). These movies are Vijay’s Master, Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru, Dhanush’s Jagame Thandhiram and Jayam Ravi’s Bhoomi. As per trade sources, all four movies are likely to release as per plan, though there are concerns of its release, in the overseas markets and neighbouring states. At the same time, the producers of Master have shifted the venue for the audio launch, which was supposed to be held at Nehru Stadium. The function will now be held at a star hotel with select guests on March 15. Master is slated for release on April 9, but the producers will finalise the release date after the censor process. 
The overseas market will pose a challenge for Tamil cinema’s business, especially in key markets like Singapore, West Asia, Europe and the US. Filmmakers have largely avoided shooting abroad, except Vikram’s Cobra, which is currently being shot in Russia’s Baltic region. Ajith Kumar’s Valimai, which had planned to can a high-octane action scene in Spain in April, has postponed the shoot. Kollywood’s ‘location guru’, Ramji, who arranges film shootings in foreign locations, says, “Today, nobody wants to travel by flights. Coronavirus has crippled the industry and the budget has gone awry considering the various expenses for shoots abroad. I hope the situation improves as summer is the best season to shoot.”
What are some of the precautionary measures taken by Tamil filmmakers? Currently shooting for his next movie with Arivazhagan in Agra, actor Arun Vijay says, “We are shooting an intense action scene in and around Taj Mahal. We are taking all measures to ensure that the crew is wearing masks and using hand sanitisers. We cannot cancel the shoot since it’s very difficult to get permission to shoot in Agra.”
Producer G Dhananjayan, on the other hand, feels it is better to stick to Chennai, in such times. He says, “Coronavirus is certainly creating a panic in Tamil cinema. The industry hopes that the virus does not spread in the State, as it might affect footfalls.” 
Distributors are monitoring the scenario on a daily basis, hoping that the situation does not get any worse. Meanwhile, the Tamil Film Distributors Association has asked the Central Government to withdraw the proposed TDS to be levied on their income and the State Government to scrap local body entertainment tax. If they are not withdrawn, T Rajendran, president (Chennai-Thiruvallur-Kanchipuram association), has stated that Tamil films would not release from March 27.",movies

Kumail Nanjiani: I wanted to look like Hrithik Roshan in ‘The Eternals’ ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kumail-nanjiani-i-wanted-to-look-like-hrithik-roshan-in-the-eternals/article31040118.ece,"Pakistani-American actor Kumail Nanjiani had one-line brief for his trainer on The Eternals: he wanted to look like Bollywood superstar Hrithik Roshan.
Nanjiani is essaying the role of Kingo, a buff Eternal who is a cosmic-powered being who lives in the present day as a Bollywood star in the Marvel Studios film.
 The Silicon Valley star had his own ideas about just how beefed up Kingo should be. 
“I wanted Kumail to have the freedom to interpret his character, especially his physicality,” director Chloe Zhao added.
 For that, Nanjiani turned to Bollywood and invoked Roshan, the Indian actor who has played the superhero Krrish in a film series. 
“I went to my trainer and said, ‘I want to look like this guy (Roshan)’,” Nanjiani told Men’s Health magazine.
 But the actor had another hurdle to cross after his physical transformation was complete: he started getting body dysmorphia, a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance.
“I don’t want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don’t have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I’d look in the mirror and I’d see my abs — and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,” he added.
 In December, the actor shared a few of his shirtless photos flaunting his abs.
 Nanjiani said though the photos on Instagram helped, he wants to be “easy” on himself.
“When I saw that reaction was when I was like, ‘Okay, I clearly don’t see what’s actually there.’ It’s something that I’m trying to be aware of and be better at, because that’s not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,” he added. ",movies

The letter also details various other demands from Mysskin namely, among others, rights to remake the film in Hindi language, transfer of intellectual property rights over the film’s title and character names to the director, a non-exclusivity clause that permits Mysskin to start work on other projects should shooting fail to happen or does not complete within 90 days of the start of second schedule, and an infringement clause which states that in the event of interference to Mysskin’s creative calls or if he or his staff be “insulted, abused threatened, ill-treated or anything that might disturb director’s psychology”, then he would “abandon” the project at that instance of said events occurring.
The letter further carries the disclaimer that disagreement to any of the 15-point demand it states will result in Mysskin “forcing his services” to Vishal Film Factory, the film’s producer, with respect to Thupparivaalan 2.
On Wednesday, Vishal, in a statement, opted to answer in the figurative to the leaked letter.

“What are the reasons for a director to opt out of a film midway?” his note begins, before the actor goes on to express his bewilderment at the turn of events. “I still wonder why does a director, who specifically wanted to write the script in Canada and UK and spent the producer’s money to the tune of close to 35 lakhs for the above expenses including travel, accommodation etc... after having started shoot without proper planning of location hunting, after having spent close to 13 crores... why would a director opt out of a movie midway?”
“Is it because I didn’t have the money to complete the film? No. Is it wrong if a producer pin points the mistakes of a director during production for its betterment especially when close to 15 lakhs per day was spent for a 3 to 4 hours of shoot in UK? No. Is it wrong if a producer requests whether we can shoot 2 scenes a day, or shoot day and night to bring down the cost of the shoot? No,” says Vishal, adding, “I still wonder because it’s as bad as you abandon your own kid in an orphanage.”
Tamil films are primarily funded by private financiers who lend money at exorbitant interest rates, a practice that, at times, has snuffed out lives of people. Vishal makes it a point to draw attention to this in his statement. “Does the director even remotely know the interest incurred and the troubles the producer goes through to make ends meet during the process of film making?” the actor says.
Asserting that the purpose of releasing the statement was because he did not want another producer to “go through such an ordeal”, Vishal, who has assisted actor-filmmaker Arjun Sarja earlier before his own claim to fame as a leading man, adds that since he knew the “nuances of film making”, he decided not to abandon Thupparivaalan 2 and went ahead directing the film himself.
“The sole purpose of the statement is not to tarnish [Mysskin’s] image but it is only to make sure that nobody else falls prey to such people, especially producers. It might be a public outcry but it’s time as the industry bleeds with all its shortcomings, I expect all producers, new and old, to know what a reputed production house like Vishal Film Factory did go through during the shoot of Thupparivaalan 2,” the statement adds.

25 years of ‘Bombay’: The story behind the iconic theme that lingers on from Mani Ratnam’s classic,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/25-years-of-bombay-the-story-behind-the-iconic-theme-that-lingers-on-from-mani-ratnams-classic/article31039332.ece,"“Yes, I’m in Mumbai,” flautist Naveen Kumar tells me over a patchy telephone call.
He calls it ‘Mumbai’ now, just like most of us are used to, but 25 years ago, it was a film titled Bombay that gave Naveen Kumar a national platform. “I remember it so vividly,” he says.
Back then, the Vishakapatnam-born musician was part of Ilaiyaraaja’s troupe in Madras, and playing the flute for various film songs. AR Rahman was part of the group as well, and the two became friends then. “We (ARR and I) also used to regularly work for Ramesh Naidu back then,” recalls Naveen. The two worked on Yodha, Roja and multiple advertisement jingles, before their piece-de-resistance would be conceptualised... for a Mani Ratnam film titled Bombay.






Naveen Kumar with A.R.Rahman
 






Naveen remembers the recording of Bombay theme at Kodambakkam’s Panchathan Record Inn like it was yesterday. “It was unusual because ARR called me to his studio in the afternoon, which he never does,” laughs Naveen. People aware of the Oscar-winning composer’s work schedule know that he always works at night, something that he continues till date. “Nevertheless, I went, and he wanted me to play a tune that he had composed.”
That recording session was uneventful, but the “magic” happened a few days later, when both Rahman and Mani Ratnam were present at the studio premises. They had chalked out something that Naveen was very unfamiliar with: a ‘musical storyboard.’ “Most recording sessions follow the same pattern: I play what the music director had composed, and wrap up. But this was different. Very different,” he says.






 
The ‘musical storyboard’ that Naveen heard that day had a descriptive brief: Imagine a time when a downpour has subsided, and the last of the rain drops are falling on the ground. Now, imagine the sound that a solitary rain drop would make if it were to fall on a leaf. “I closed my eyes, tried visualising that and started playing,” he says. Over the next hour or so was recorded the now-iconic ‘Bombay theme’, which starts off like an almost-hesitant whisper and turns into a lilting melody before allowing the grand violins to take over.
Naveen and AR Rahman might have got international acclaim with that theme they conceptualised that day — the composer even played it in the continuum fingerboard at Berklee College of Music in 2014 — but there’s another person who warrants equal praise: late sound engineer H Sridhar. “He was a genius. He created magic out of our sounds. There can be no replacement for Sridhar saab,” rues Naveen, whose personal favourites include his flute interludes in Evano Oruvan (Alaipayuthe) and the Cyclist’s Rhythm track from Hindi film Meenaxi.






Naveen Kumar during a performance
 






25 years on, Naveen has worked on multiple film assignments, with leading music composers. He remains one of the most sought-after flautists in the country, often conceptualises musical shows of his own and is currently collaborating with American composer Wayne Sharpe and Brooklyn-based record producer Joel Hamilton on international projects. He has about 500 flutes (“There are 5 boxes full of them”) and has invented nine flutes, in pursuit of different sounds. “I’m also doing covers of late, of Anirudh’s Darbar and GV Prakash’s Asuran songs,” he says. Naveen has not been approached by Kollywood for any music composition projects, but has worked on a few Telugu films in the 90s. “I’m still open to offers, but playing the flute gives me most happiness.”",movies

Didn’t we brief you about this well in advance? Where is your boss?...” The event organiser is clearly livid. 
I am at a low-key award show, where the organiser is giving a dressing down to a group of visibly mortified bouncers. Their fault? Wearing trainers when the instruction was to wear black shoes, coinciding with their ‘Men in Black’ costume. 
As it turns out, such episodes are an occupational hazard. “There can never be an event without errors. Hiccups are bound to happen in our profession,” says S Sathya with a faint smile to imply that the situation is under control. 
Towering men in tight T-shirts, condescendingly flexing their muscles, bouncers often seem intimidating to the general public. However, there is more to these men than bulging biceps and that stereotypical menacing gaze. “You can flaunt your physique. But that alone won’t guarantee opportunities. What matters, in this profession, is smart work and the ability to think on your feet,” he says, dispelling the notion that a chiselled body is all that it takes to break into this world.
Sathya is the proprietor of The Expendables Bouncers, which was established in 2011 with the singular intention of providing security to film stars. 
Bouncers are enlisted on the basis of three categories of service: nightclub bouncers, personal bodyguards and protocol team. The latter is an expansive service usually reserved for VVIP stars. He cites the example of Hrithik Roshan’s recent trip to Chennai, where his team trailed the actor through the day. “We received him at the airport and took him to a mall in the city. It was quite challenging since over 40,000 people had gathered at the venue.”
Today, his clients include Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, Vijay, Ajith Kumar, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, amongst others. “Wherever the celebrity goes, I follow,” he laughs. His company is responsible for the safety and security of stars, irrespective of the scale of the event — be it an award show, private party or corporate event. So, Sathya is invariably on the lookout for more hires, although he has a “loyal” team of 20. “Staff keep rotating, depending on the event. None of them is a full-time employee and they work for multiple companies at any given time,” he says, adding that they earn anywhere between ₹1,500 to ₹2,500 per person, per event.

After graduating with a diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 2009, Sathya was looking for a way to make easy money to meet household expenses. Like many fitness enthusiast, he was primed to take part in bodybuilding championships. But his quick fix was a part-time job as a bodyguard — a term interchangably used with ‘bouncer’ in the city. 
“I still remember my first event, a private party on New Year’s Eve. That was when bouncers first started wearing black T-shirts and track pants,” he recalls, discussing Chennai in the early 2000s. He says he was overwhelmed for the initial few years. For one, there wasn’t much scope for physical work, since they were stationed at one place for up to seven hours. “Nobody briefed us about what was expected; all of us were new. We were paid around ₹150 to ₹200 for an event,” he says. 
Sathya adds that the decision to start a full-fledged security service was actually an afterthought, when he had gone to watch The Expendables (2010). “There is a scene where all actors come together in a slow-motion sequence. That made me name my company after the movie,” he says, “Our first event ended with us posing like the iconic still from TheExpendables.”

Special Arrangement  





Each time Sathya gets an offer from a client, he devises a plan keeping in mind entry and exit points, as well as logistical challenges. There is a mandatory briefing session before the event, on the team’s role. “No foul language, no intimidating looks and never get physical... these I insist on,” says Sathya. But, he adds, “It all boils down to the kind of crowd you’re dealing with.”
 There is one particular memory about a fan, which he describes as “harrowing”. It involved a leading Tamil star, so naturally, it invited eyeballs and shutterbugs. Sathya and his team were occupied with their usual ‘push and nudge’ technique — an approach that blocks the crowd from getting close to actors.
Everything went smoothly until a fan launched himself at the celebrity from the podium, landing just a few feet from him. He says, “We swung into action and formed a human chain. But the star intervened and was gracious enough to pose for a picture with the fan.”
A bouncer’s diarySathya works out two hours every day at C3 Fitness in Royapuram. His diet chart for muscle gain is as follows:Breakfast: Oats and juice.Lunch: Brown rice with chicken and four egg whites.Snacks: White bread and fruits.Dinner: Roti with chicken or beef or tuna.Vijay and Nayanthara are two stars who have a massive fan following, according to Sathya.The Expendables Bouncers’ next big event is Master audio launch, scheduled to take place on March 15.
He adds, “People, especially fans, don’t understand our job and tend to get personal. There have been times where I have been abused and hit,” he says. 
In his rulebook, the priority is to ensure a safe environment. “You need to gauge the celebrity’s mood and act accordingly,” says Sathya, “ If they are impressed with your work, your name spreads like wildfire in the industry.”
 Sathya says he is rarely starstruck. Except for the time when he met his idol Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor had flown to Chennai for the audio launch of Shankar’s I in 2014. 
“From receiving him at the airport to watching him work out at the gym, everything was surreal for me. It’s a feeling only fitness enthusiasts would get,” he says, adding that it was one of the biggest shows he handled, with over 200 bouncers at his disposal.

Another silver lining was a chance to meet Kai Greene when he arrived in the city for a gym launch. “He is like God to me. I couldn’t get time with Arnold, but I spoke to Kai Greene and took a picture with him. I had goosebumps that day.”
Sathya says he cannot afford to skip a gym session and has to pump some iron for at least two hours a day. “The day you gain fat is when you become unfit for this profession. It’s your body that earns you bread and butter.”",movies
"‘Agnisikha’: a documentary on Eashwari Bai, one of Independent India’s first female politicians",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/agnisikha-a-documentary-on-eashwari-bai-one-of-independent-indias-first-female-politicians/article31037655.ece,"A politician, a changemaker and an active member of the Republican Party of India, Eashwari Bai fought for her beliefs all her life. A documentary film made on her life was screened at the 4th Indian World Film festival in Hyderabad and brought to life, the thoughts and ideals of a politician who fought for the underprivileged.
Eashwari Bai was the epitome of woman’s empowerment during the 1950s and 60s and an active participant in the Telangana movement of 1969 for which she was even jailed and sent to the Chanchalguda Central Jail. A municipal counsellor and an MLA for two terms, she used her voice to bring about positive change in society — whether it was in or outside the Assembly.
The 35-minute long documentary, Agnisikha (which means firebrand in Telugu) was a crisp and concise retelling of her political journey. It showcased her major successes in policy making, whether it was bringing about change in the uniform of the Police department (from shorts to trousers), taking up the issues of livelihoods of the fisher folk or batting for women’s education. The short film succeeded in introducing the work of the leader who actively fought for her beliefs to the younger generation. It was also successful in recreating a vintage era, by the thoughtful montages of rocks in the backdrop, costumes (and the style of the drapes) as well as the dialect of the actors.

The film mostly shot in and around Hyderabad, was completed last year and has been doing the rounds of film festivals (Crownwood and Beyond Earth film festivals amongst others) where it was feted and won four awards. Politico Geeta Reddy, Eashwari Bai’s daughter and the producer of the documentary calls her mother an unusual personality. “She was a single leader who soldered on without financial or organizational support. She took on the pertinent issues of the day and as the chairperson for women and child welfare, was instrumental in ensuring free education to young girls. Her faith in the ideals of Babasaheb Ambedkar made her work towards a value-based system.”
Geetha Reddy says, that her mother’s story is as relevant today as it was half a century ago. “I wanted to share her story as it is an inspiration. From a teacher to a politician she always moved ahead with confidence and courage.” The documentary movie also marks the debut of its director, Sathyacama Jabali who worked on it almost for a year interviewing around 150 people from Eashwari Bai’s old constituency of Yellareddy and poring over the archives of Telangana department and the Assembly. “I got a lot of inputs, but the challenge was to showcase the conflict of an individual both within herself and with the surroundings. We understood the sociology and conditions of the time she lived in and documented her journey.”

Shanti Rao who worked in short films in Telugu and Tamil pulled off a confident portrayal of the firebrand leader which included getting the body language and confidence of a politician correctly. The young actress says the workshops held and videos of women politicians helped her in getting the tone and tenor of the leader right. “I was nervous as I was re-living the life of a dynamic person, but it was a learning experience as I had to add my own imagination to the character. Also, it was difficult to enact the part of someone older to me, but it was a blessing to get it right.”
Screened on Women’s Day, the documentary brought to fore the life and times of one of Independent India’s first female politicians not only documenting her stellar journey but also inspiring countless other women in the process.",movies
Shared economy at $2 bn by end-2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/shared-economy-at-2-bn-by-end-2020/article31034036.ece,"The shared economy in India is estimated to be an about $2 billion industry by the end of the current year, according to a recent report by Maple Capital Advisors.
The ‘shared economy’ includes segments such as co-working (Awfis, WeWork India), co-living (Stanza Living, OYO Life, Oxford Caps), shared mobility (Uber, Ola, Shuttl) and furniture rental (Furlenco, Rentomojo.)
As per the report titled ‘Shared Economy — India Story,’ with high mobile penetration, high millennial concentration and an aspirational population, Asia has the highest willingness to use shared assets. 
“India mirrors Asia trends in these aspects and is thus poised for high growth and adoption of shared services,” it added.
In 2019, the segment was estimated to be over $1.5 billion in size in India. 
The market size for the co-working sector is pegged at $500 million, while that for co-living is estimated to be $400 million, shared mobility at over $630 million, and furniture rental at $200 million. The report noted that about $3.7 billion worth of capital has been infused in India in such services till now, adding that a similar amount is expected to be infused in the next couple of years. 
“Given the growth, potential profitability and momentum, we expect significant IPOs and private funding in the next 2-3 years,” it added.
“India is at the cusp of a shared economy revolution. We are already witnessing phenomenal growth in this segment with both international companies and home-grown start-ups vying for market share. Even as the space is nascent, over $3.7 bn has been invested in this space and we expect this to accelerate from here, on the back of compelling demand and unit economics,” Pankaj Karna, MD, Maple Capital Advisors, said.
The report added, “In this era of growing concern on climate, wastage, resource scarcity and population intensity (especially in the developing world), the shared economy seems to be a sustainable, scalable and efficient form of addressing these concerns.”",economy

 The Indian rupee on March 9, had fell to a 17-month low of 74.17 against dollar amid mounting fears of a coronavirus-led economic slowdown.
 The forex market was closed on Tuesday on account of Holi.
 At the interbank foreign exchange the rupee opened at 73.88, then gained further ground and touched a high of 73.84 against dollar, registering a rise of 33 paise over its previous close.
 The domestic currency, however, could not hold on to the gains and was trading at 73.96 against the American unit at 1004 hrs.
 On Monday, rupee had settled at 74.17 against the greenback.
 Meanwhile, investor sentiment remained fragile amid concerns over the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the global economy, forex traders said.
 The global death toll from the new coronavirus crossed 4,000 as the outbreak has spread to over 100 countries with more than 110,000 cases of infection.
 Domestic bourses opened on a positive note on Wednesday with benchmark indices Sensex trading 66.97 points higher at 35,701.92 and Nifty up by 3.85 points at 10,455.30.
 Traders said the rise in crude oil prices helped in the recovery of equity market and trading sentiment as oil prices had crashed on Monday.
 Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, rose 3.36% to USD 38.47 per barrel. Despite the rise, Brent crude prices are trading on a muted note, traders said.
 Meanwhile, Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital market, as they sold equity shares worth ₹6,595.56 crore on Monday, according to provisional exchange data.
 Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against the basket of six currencies was trading 0.28% lower at 96.14.

 Global stocks too gave mixed signals with bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong trading on a positive note, while those in Seoul and Tokyo dropping over 1%.
 Stock exchanges in the U.S. ended sharply higher on Tuesday on hopes of U.S. economic stimulus efforts as the coronavirus continued to spread rapidly.

Brent roared back as much as 10% on hopes a supply cut deal could be rescued, while most benchmark government bond yields were off record lows as hopes for stimulus in the face of the epidemic boosted risk sentiment. Wall Street main markets wasted little time in recouping at least 2% of the 7% they had slumped on Monday, one of their worst days on record.
The oil and gas and mining sectors were leading the charge for Europe as oil recovered some of Monday’s 25% fall following what had appeared to be the complete breakdown of a crucial global oil pact between OPEC and Russia.
Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury debt more than doubled to 0.7% and those on German Bunds jumped around 20 basis points at one point as investors pared some safe-haven holdings, though they were beginning to ease again.
Supporting the mood was a pledge from U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to take “major” steps to protect the economy and float the idea of a payroll tax cut with congressional Republicans.
Japan said it would spend another 430.8 billion yen ($4.1 billion) to ease the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and Italy’s deputy economy minister announced that mortgage payments would be suspended as the country deals with the second highest number of cases outside China.
Some of the biggest global investment banks, including JP Morgan, Citi and Barclays, now expect the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates to zero in the coming months as part of a mass global move to provide some ballast and liquidity to the financial system.
“As of today, we believe that markets have gone from being overly complacent to overly pessimistic,” the chief investment officers of Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi wrote in a note to clients.
“Our central case, instead, is one of a temporary setback, although more prolonged compared to what we were expecting a month ago, followed by a recovery,” they added.
Oil suffered its sharpest drop since the 1991 Gulf war and global stocks plunged on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched a crude price war with Russia, further rattling investors already anxious about the spread of coronavirus.
Tuesday’s market fight back had begun to gain traction in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei had ended the day up 0.85%, after earlier touching its lowest level since April 2017.
Australia’s index closed up 3.1% as some went hunting for bargains in beaten down stocks.

"Amid coronavirus threat, the Olympic flame is lit",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/amid-coronavirus-threat-the-olympic-flame-is-lit/article31052835.ece,"The Olympic flame for the 2020 Tokyo Games was lit in ancient Olympia on Thursday amid an unprecedented health lockdown as Greece registered its first death from coronavirus.
With spectators banned, an actress dressed as an ancient Greek high priestess lit the flame using the rays of the sun reflected off a concave mirror, launching a week-long torch relay in Greece before the flame is handed to Tokyo organisers on March 19.
“Today marks the beginning of the journey of the Olympic flame to Japan,” said International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach. “When the flame returns to Tokyo after 56 years, hope will light the way across the entire country,” he said.
Japan last hosted the summer Olympics — also in Tokyo — in 1964.
Now it seeks to use the 2020 Olympics to show the world it has regained its creative flair and innovative energy, but also as a means to highlight reconstruction following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima.
“Japan will demonstrate its ground-breaking innovation and boundless creative energy with regard to sustainability, technology and human-centred growth,” Bach said. “The Olympic Games... will again be a symbol of hope and confidence for all Japanese people.”
But, with the coronavirus causing devastation in world sport, doubts are increasingly being raised over whether the Olympics can be held as scheduled from July 24 to August 9.

Organisers have insisted the Games will go ahead as planned and the IOC has said there has not yet been any talk of cancellation or postponement. The IOC has said it will coordinate closely with the World Health Organisation, which has now officially classified the outbreak as a pandemic.
The torch relay in Greece is scheduled to pass through 37 cities and 15 archaeological sites covering 3,500km and 842 nautical miles and will be carried by 600 runners.
The hydrogen that powers the Olympic flame will be produced in the town of Namia in Fukushima, one of the worst affected areas, said Toshiaki Endo, acting president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee. And the torch has been partially produced from recycled aluminium originally used to build temporary housing units in the aftermath of the quake, he said.
Greek Olympic shooting champion Anna Korakaki was the initial torch-bearer, the first time a woman has been chosen for the role. She was followed by Mizuki Noguchi, gold medallist in the women's marathon at the 2004 Athens Olympics.
Hollywood actor Gerard Butler will be among the runners once the torch relay reaches Sparta.
The ceremony was held without spectators after dozens of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the broader western Peloponnese. Up to 12,000 had been expected to make their way to Olympia, where the ancient Games were held.
Only 100 accredited guests from the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, compared to 700 originally, were allowed to attend Thursday's ceremony.
The dress rehearsal on Wednesday was also closed to the public and dinners and galas arranged for the torch lighting have been scrapped. The only precedent is in 1984 when the Greek leg of the torch relay was abandoned in a protest by Greek organisers against what they saw as the commercialisation of the Los Angeles Olympics.",other sports

""The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight’s schedule of games until further notice,” the league said in a statement. “The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”
The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups and tip-off was moments away when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed “due to unforeseen circumstances.”

In 1960s Kochi, eating out was purely aspirational. It was the exception; not the norm and people from ‘respectable families’ never ate out. To this milieu came KC Mathew with an idea so modern and so radical he knew his hometown Pala would not be able to take it.
So he opened one of Kerala’s first ever “Western-style” restaurants in Kochi and called it Volga. Situated at the Carmel Buildings on Banerji Road, it was ahead of its time in every way. One had to wear a suit to be allowed entry, it served Chinese, continental and Mughalai fare, which were exotic to this part of the world and the liquor was fancy and foreign. A live band played and a cabaret was added for effect.







A banker by profession, who managed the Delhi branch of Pala Central Bank (owned by his maternal family), one of the country’s first private sector banks, Mathew had no previous experience running a hotel. Yet, he was completely invested in the project. He travelled, did research in his own way, sent out people to head hunt for Volga’s kitchen and ran it like a professional. “Appachan wanted it to be something the city had never seen before,” says KM Alexander, Mathew’s eldest son and Managing Partner of Volga Tourist Home. 
Mathew brought in chefs who had experience working in bigger cities and he ensured the décor was top notch. “The doors alone were the topic of discussion. Made of rosewood, they were heavy and inlaid with brass. They opened into a large hallway, which led to the restaurant, with an elaborately ornate false ceiling, one of the first of its kind at that time,” says Alexander. Opened in 1967, Volga was indeed the talk of the town. “When a few from Pala showed up in mundus, they weren’t allowed entry. Miffed, I think they held it against Appachan for a long time,” Alexander reminisces.







It is unclear how Mathew arrived at the name though. “He might have been inspired by the Volga, Russia’s largest river,” says Alexander. “Or perhaps, he would have come across a hotel by the same name somewhere,” offers Mathew Alexander, Mathew’s grandson, Partner of Volga Tourist Home and entrepreneur.
Tourists made up most of Volga’s customers. It even had a shuttle service that ferried tourists from the port to the hotel and back. In 1970, three years into its existence, Volga ran into troubled times. Following an issue with the trade union, the hotel was temporarily shut down. However, it reopened a few months later, cutting a few of its frills, including the dress code. But it still drew businessmen from different parts of the State, who made it a point to halt at Kochi to visit Volga. It hosted an after-party of a film award festival held in 1967, which had Sharmila Tagore and Sunil Dutt, in addition to the top stars of Malayalam cinema participating.







Volga Appachan as Mathew was fondly called, passed on in 1992. Ten years later, in 2002, Volga ran into trouble again. An anti-liquour campaign forced it to shut down the bar. The hotel functioned without a bar till 2006, but gradually shut down. When it reopened in Kadavanthra as Volga Tourist Home, a striking building in white, Volga had however, only its rich legacy to build on. Kochi had grown tremendously and other players had secured their foothold in the F&B segment. Volga Tourist Home, however, still had a set of patrons, who had seen its day in the sun, who dropped in regularly, mainly for its ginger prawn.
As we sit, mulling over Volga’s chequered history, Satheesh Shinilal, the chef, walks in bearing a plate of its historic dish — the ginger prawn. The dish remains unchanged since it was first made by Shinilal at the hotel almost 50 years ago. “It still has a devoted set of fans,” declares Mathew Alexander. The ginger chicken and ginger prawn, that old Volga served, was the stuff of fantasies.
Arun, the playful tuskerManoj Mathew, the youngest son of KC Mathew (Volga Appachan) was a well-known aana premi (elephant lover). Thanks to him, the family owned an elephant, which was brought in from Kodanad. Arun, as he was named, was mischievous and was a darling of the family. “He has all the attributes of a traditional Kerala elephant,” says Mathew Alexander. Popularly known as Volga Arun, his love for jackfruit was legendary, says Mathew. Once, while on work in an estate near Chalakkudy, Arun decided to take a break. He waded into a nearby river, and splashed around, enjoying himself. This startled a few people who worried whether he was in a state of musth. The mahout, who found him in the river, tried to call him, but Arun refused to come out. It was only after the mahout dangled a jackfruit in front of him that Arun followed him, recounts Mathew. Arun was given away to another family in Vadakkancherry. 
When one of Appachan’s managers went to Bangalore, he happened to eat at the hotel where Shinilal was the chef. Impressed by the dishes he tasted, the manager asked if Shinilal would like to come to Kochi and join Volga and he gladly agreed. “The association with Volga, which began in the 70s continues to this day,” says Shinilal. “Volga was number One those days, followed by Oberoi and then Sealord,” he adds. Shinilal doesn’t share the recipe, but what makes his dish distinct is that theprawn is always fresh, he emphasises. Alexander’s brother and Appachan’s second son, KM Paulson (Pappachan), the managing partner, ensures that the fish and meat are bought fresh. 
Volga, which is now a two-star property, has a bar in the basement, and a family restaurant with a rooftop eating area as well. And the other dishes that tick the right boxes are bar snacks Kerala pork roast, the BDF (beef dry fry) and kozhi idichathu. 
Not many may be aware of its history, but as Mathew Alexander says, Volga is a name that still resonates with an old timer in Kochi. ",society
"Deepa M makes healthy baby food, noodles and sevai with millets",https://www.thehindu.com/society/deepa-m-makes-healthy-baby-food-noodles-and-sevai-with-millets/article31048935.ece,"It was the task of finding appropriate baby food for her son that set Deepa M on the entrepreneurial path. Armed with a post-graduate degree in Food and Nutrition from Chennai’s Women’s Christian College, she studied the nutrition labels of various brands but found them “loaded with preservatives,” she rolls her eyes. “So I decided to make my own.”
The pause after this statement is filled with the background noise of chatter and vehicular movement, as we sit in the forecourt of Prozone Mall. Wasn’t that a rather rash idea, I ask hesitantly. “Not really. It was only a question of applying what I had learnt in college.” This happened back in 2013 and, since her classmates also worked as nutritionists, Deepa got them to approve her samples and finally zeroed in on what is now called Some More Complete Health Mix. “I would make around five kilos because neighbours, friends and relatives also bought it from me.” 
This health mix is made of millets, red rice, pulses and legumes and dry fruits, with all ingredients being from organic farms in Tamil Nadu. The millets are sourced in Theni, explains Deepa, and the other ingredients from a local source in Tirupur. “The farthest is Chennai. All the items are native and organic.” 






Millets are good for one’s health

From this health mix, Deepa moved to noodles and sevai. “Both are popular tiffin items,” she smiles. Again what troubled her was that available options were mostly made of maida. So she began experimenting and came up with 10 variants of noodles all made from millets and whole wheat flour. “No additives or preservatives,” she emphasies, adding, “Even the masala that comes with the noodles is my formulation.” After her PG, she did a course in food processing, which she used to develop these products.
In the past seven years, Deepa has developed three baby food items, which retail under the brand name First Spoon. The Health Mix, Millet Noodles and Millet Sevai are sold as Some More products. “The Health Mix actually began as a weaning food for babies. Now it is a complete easy-to-digest meal.” Her second product was derived from khichdi: rice, wheat and dal mix. “I now have 24 products,” Deepa says proudly; 10 variants each of sevai and noodles and two more baby food products.
Her latest product under First Spoon is a Ragi Banana Mix made of sprouted ragi flour, dried and powdered nendrampazham, pottukadalai (fried gram) and cardamom. “Ragi is a source of micronutrients and the nendrampazham is full of prebiotics, which is good for gut health.”
Deepa works on the R&D and product development with a food scientist on her team. Once the formulation is ready, she looks for manufacturers. “I prefer to work with small-scale entrepreneurs. I am very particular about hygiene and the process of manufacturing, so I conduct periodic checks.” 
Cook and seeThe Complete Health Mix is pretty easy to cook. For one glass (250 ml), only around 1.5 teaspoons of the mix is required. Cook it with water and add milk. Even without additional sugar/jaggery, the drink is faintly sweet with an after taste of cardamom. If you’re looking for a porridge-like consistency, then a little more of the mix will do the job.I prefer another iteration: cook with water, pour buttermilk, mix well. Add a light garnish of finely chopped small onion, green chillies and coriander leaves. Finish with a tadka of mustard. It makes a truly delicious summer drink. One glass is quite filling and keeps you feeling comfortably full for quite some time.For someone used to commercial brands, the taste of the Red Rice Noodles takes some getting used to. The masala has a distinct home-made aroma and flavour. Add a cup of vegetables when you cook them and one packet makes a comfortable meal for two people. 
Once the product is ready, she looks after the marketing. Apart from her own websites, her products are available on Amazon and D Mart. She is in talks with Reliance and Big Basket to scale up the availability. “I hope to enter the hypermarkets soon,” she smiles. “It doesn’t take much time to launch new products but I can’t do both that and the marketing.” 
Asked about reactions from her family to her business ventures, she candidly admits that there wasn’t much support initially. “My husband runs his family business and my father had his own as well. So their attitude was: ‘why do you want to work?’”
But she refused to let this deter her. “Once I proved myself and started contributing to the family income, they have come around. Now I am able to travel only because they help look after my son who’s now in class 6. We have to be persistent. One can’t say ‘I don’t have family support’ and give up,” she says firmly.

Advice from women founders of two successful apps: Be persistent with a great idea,https://www.thehindu.com/society/advice-from-successful-women-app-developers-sairee-chahal-gauri-angrish/article31048752.ece,"While there have been successes and challenges in the path of many women developers in the country, the next decade seems uncertain. Two well-regarded professionals, Sairee Chahal, founder of the Sheroes app, and Gauri Angrish, known for starting the Caredose app, share their advice for budding developers, who want to make it big. “You have to be persistent with a great idea... and you have to push it along with serious momentum.” says Chahal.
Since 1999 she has seen some major turning points. “I’ve seen how the tech space has responded to the financial crises, which has certainly affected funding for startups — especially women-run ones. The ecosystem now, though, is ready but the resources aren’t stacked as high.”
Ask Angrish if she would have had the same opportunities as she does now, five years ago and she notes a “positive evolution for women in tech.” However, she adds, “I don’t think things have changed drastically enough to [have made] a difference in resources between now and five years ago.”






SHEROES founder Sairee Chahal
 






Angrish, who was working in big pharma before starting Caredose, knew of the extent of the problem of medicine non-adherence. “What got me excited about trying to solve this problem was not only the sheer patient numbers, but also the fact that the problem impacted each and every entity in the healthcare spectrum — from pharmaceutical manufacturers to health insurance companies; from providers to public health systems.”
She then quit her corporate job to open a brick and mortar pharmacy in Delhi to get a tangible idea of the problems patients, as well as those in the supply chain, face. The research then culminated in Caredose, an app which helps people keep a track of medicine dosages every day.
“I think the most impactful change has been in education. A lot of universities are building programmes that encourage women to explore the world of technology. They also carve out opportunities with companies to give students early exposure and therefore interest in tech,” says Angrish.
She says that while it has been great to see “the positive evolution towards a more equality driven mindset, we still have a long way to go.”






Caredose founder Gauri Angrish
 






But Chahal says that women are naturally inclined towards community building. “The next few years will see a huge growth for collaboration. Technologists often find opportunity for this when they use the same coding language. This is how the community mobilises for stronger knowledge transfer,” she adds. 
Within the reality that few start-ups even make it, things are “truly more difficult for women,” Chahal says. Mental and emotional strength are important because “rejection is just a part of the game,” she concludes.

Retail auto sales up 2.6% in Feb.,https://www.thehindu.com/business/retail-auto-sales-up-26-in-feb/article31052710.ece,"Retail sales of automobiles in the country, as measured by vehicle registration numbers, grew 2.6% to over 17.11 lakh units in February 2020, according to data shared by Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. 
The automobile dealers’ industry body added that sales of passenger vehicles declined by 1.17% to over 2.26 lakh units last month. However, retail sales of two-wheelers stood at over 12.85 lakh units, up 1.52%, while sales of commercial vehicles grew by 13% to 92,805 units.
Additionally, three-wheeler sales were up 20.7% to 65,752 units, while tractor retail sales grew 13.52% to 41,485 units.
FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said, “February turned positive for retail sales for most of the segments as the entire auto ecosystem focussed on liquidation of their BS-IV stocks.” He, however, added that despite year-on-year sales growth, the overall retail sales were much below expectations as there was no pre-buying for BS-IV stocks.
“Rural sales contributed to retail sales turning green, with tractors also being in double-digit growth for the second month in a row,” he added. Mr. Kale said inventory levels remained a serious concern for BS-IV two-wheelers and asked manufacturers to handhold dealers for 100% liquidation of stocks before the March 31 deadline.
“FADA survey reveals that a very high number of two-wheeler dealers will not be able to fully liquidate their BS-IV inventory and expressed inadequate support from their OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] for 100% liquidation of this stock,” Mr. Kale said.
With regard to passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, he said the overall inventory was at a reasonable level, but the challenge remained in slow-moving, non-popular models as dealers looked for adequate OEM support for liquidation of the same in March.",business
"No plan for any telco package, Centre tells Parliament",https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-plan-for-any-telco-package-centre-tells-parliament/article31052658.ece,"The government is currently not considering any proposal for a relief package for the telecom industry that is reeling under severe financial stress, Parliament was informed on Thursday.
Asked whether the government was considering working on a relief package for telecom service providers and if a committee of secretaries had been constituted for the same, Minister of State for Communications Sanjay Dhotre, in a written reply to Rajya Sabha, said, “No such proposal is under consideration by the government.”
Replying to a separate question on the adjusted gross revenue-related dues, the Minister said the Telecom Department would issue revised demand notices to the telcos following a reassessment exercise on the basis of documents submitted by them in support of their self-assessed dues.
“The telecom service providers have been directed to make payments on the basis of self assessment and submit requisite documents for compliance. Following this, DoT will carry out reassessments on the basis of documents submitted by the telecom service providers in accordance with the licence agreement and issue revised demand notices,” the Minister said.
He added that the AGR case was sub-judice and in 2016 it was submitted in the Supreme Court that DoT would keep raising the demand but not insist on payments till the final judgment by the court.
“After the judgment dated 24.10.2019, the dues are crystalised and the TSPs have made some payments... The DoT has also directed the TSPs to make remaining payments vide letters dated 13.11.2019, 20.01.2020, 14.02.2020 and 04.03.2020,” he said.",business

“We advise that the Executive Committee of Central Board (ECCB), at its meeting held on 11.03.2020, accorded approval for purchase of 725 crore shares in Yes Bank Ltd. at a price of ₹10 per share subject to all regulatory approvals. Our shareholding in Yes Bank Ltd. will remain within 49% of the paid up capital of Yes Bank,” the communication said.
While announcing the draft plan for the reconstruction of Yes Bank after the bank was put under moratorium, RBI had said that the authorised capital would be ₹5,000 crore and number of equity shares would be 2,400 of ₹2 each, aggregating to ₹4,800 crore. RBI said that the investor bank must agree to invest in the equity of the reconstructed bank to the extent that post infusion it holds 49% shareholding at a price not less than ₹10. 
The investor bank will not be able to reduce its holding below 26% before completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital, according to the draft plan. Chairman Rajnish Kumar had said the bank’s investment in Yes Bank would not exceed ₹10,000 crore.

RBI tells States not to shift deposits from private banks ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-tells-states-not-to-shift-deposits-from-private-banks/article31052630.ece,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked all State governments to refrain from shifting their deposits from private sector banks to government banks.
The move came after the Maharashtra government directed all its departments, civic bodies and semi-government corporations not to transact with private banks after private sector lender Yes Bank was put on moratorium last week.
Observing that some other State governments were also contemplating such a move, the RBI, in a strongly-worded letter to all chief secretaries of the States, said apprehension regarding safety of deposits in private sector banks was highly misplaced and such reactions would not be in the interest of the financial stability of the banking system. “We strongly believe that such a move can have banking and financial sector stability implications,” the letter said.
“We would like to point out that the Reserve Bank has adequate powers to regulate and supervise private sector banks and by using these powers it has ensured depositors’ money is entirely safe. It is pertinent to mention that the resolution of weak private sector banks in the past has been done in a manner that the depositors are not put at a loss. 
“It is precisely with the view to retaining depositors’ confidence in private banks and their mitigating their hardship that, after the imposition of moratorium on Yes Bank Ltd., the RBI has drawn up the draft scheme without any delay, and we are making every effort for the finalisation of the scheme,” RBI said.",business

Indian airlines to continue flights to most international destinations ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-airlines-to-continue-flights-to-most-international-destinations/article31052613.ece,"Indian airlines will continue to fly to most international destinations for the time being, but with reduced frequencies, as they adopt a wait-and-watch policy following the government’s ban on entry of foreign nationals and overseas citizens of India to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Air India has cancelled its flights to Rome, Milan, Seoul and reduced its frequencies to Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid after the latest government advisory. 
An Air India executive said, “the airline is holding on for sometime” from taking a decision on bulk cancellations across its international network. All Indian carriers had cancelled flights to different destinations in China such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Hong Kong in January. IndiGo informed the BSE on Wednesday that it expects “quarterly earnings to be materially impacted” after a 15-20% fall in daily bookings in the past few days. The airline also hinted in its filing that while earlier it was able to redeploy airplanes freed up due to cancellations, that may not be an option anymore as there is an overall slump in demand across international and domestic markets. An airline executive said on the condition of anonymity, “we won’t cancel all international flights, but there will be a curtailment,” adding the domestic demand had taken a hit because of worries over catching an infection. 
With Indians still allowed to travel abroad, domestic carriers will continue to fly on most international routes until operating them becomes financially unviable.
Go Air has also suspended 50% of its international flights with operations to Male, Bangkok, Kuwait, Dammam and Singapore out of a total nine international destinations suspended, according to its vice-president for corporate communication Bakul Gala. 
Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation P. S. Kharola held a meeting with officials of SpiceJet on Thursday. He had already met executives from IndiGo, GoAir, AirAsiaIndia and Vistara over the past few days. The Ministry will “soon” be submitting a report to the Finance Ministry on the impact on the aviation industry along with recommendations.
“This ban will cripple the industry with a very serious impact on airlines with weaker balance sheets. The domestic sector will see a further slump in demand in the next few weeks and the first quarter, which was likely to be peak travel time, has already been significantly compromised,” according to CAPA’s India CEO Kapil Kaul. The first quarter is usually a good quarter for airlines due to summer vacations when demand for travel peaks.
According to an analyses by CAPA, South-East Asia has seen the maximum percentage drop in capacity deployment for the week commencing on March 9,2020 as compared to week commencing December 2, 2019.
Deployment to China by Indian airlines has seen a drop of 96.2%, to South Korea 50%, Japan 25%, Hong Kong 100%, Thailand 64.5% and Singapore 28.8%. To India’s west, airlines have slashed capacity by 42.9% to Italy, 18.7% to U.K., 12.8% to Kuwait and 9.9% to Qatar.
Interestingly, the rate of cancellations by foreign carriers to these routes is much less — 0% change in deployment to Italy, 2.3% drop for UK, 60% to Hong Kong, 16.8% to Singapore and 1% to Qatar.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Civil Aviation told Lok Sabha that international passengers arriving at Indian airports had fallen to 62,000 from 70,000. He said that this might come down to around 40,000 following the travel advisory issued on Wednesday. ",business

GST collection in February up by 8% at ₹1.05 lakh cr.

Experts said the rate hike would improve working capital position of the manufactures as it would correct the inverted duty structure but may lead to increase in price of the finished goods.
Currently, under the goods and services tax (GST), certain manufactured goods attract a tax rate of 5% or 12% while their inputs, input services and capital goods attract GST at the higher rate of 18% or 28%. The manufacturers have to claim a refund of accumulated input tax credit (ITC) where the tax rate on input is higher than the finished goods.
According to sources, the refund claimed on account of inverted rate structure is about ₹20,000 crore per year and there is a need to correct this anomaly.
Significant items in inverted rate structure are fertilizers, mobiles, footwears, man-made yarns and fabrics, renewable energy devices and tractors. A number of other smaller items such as utensils also attract inverted duty structure.
“The GST Council will take up in phases the correction of inverted duty on items as per the recommendation of the officers’ committee. On Saturday, 4 items – mobiles, fertilizer, footwear and man-made fibre, fabric and garments – would come up for correction,” the official said.
Currently, cellphones attract a GST rate of 12%, while its inputs are taxed at 18%.
“There is hardly any justification for retaining mobile at the slab rate of 12%, while many items such as TV, torches, geyser, iron, heaters, mixer, juicers, etc., attract GST at a higher rate,” the official added.
In the pre-GST era, under the dual excise scheme, a manufacturer had two options for excise duty – basic excise duty (BED) at 2% or 1% without CENVAT Credit, and BED at 12.5% with CENVAT credit. Imported mobile phones were being subjected to additional duty of customs (equal to higher of the BED) at 12.5%. In central excise, there was no provision for refund of input tax credit on account of inverted duty structure.
While fertilizer was originally placed in 12% slab, the Council later lowered the rate to 5%. A total of ₹6,000 crore have been claimed as input tax credit refund on fertilizers from July 2017 till date.
Fertilizer manufacturers have been claiming lower rate on other inputs such as ammonia and sulphur. Besides, 18% rate on services and capital goods adds to duty inversion, the official added.
The total pre-GST tax incidence, including central excise, tax on inputs, average VAT, CST and octroi, on fertilizers was estimated to be about 9.75%.
Besides, the duty inversion in man-made fibre (MMF) value chain has led to a total refund claim of about ₹1,600 crore so far on man-made yarn and another ₹2,300 crore on fabrics and other textile items.
The MMF value chain such as polyester, acrylic and viscose has unlike GST rate structure. While fibre attracts GST at the rate of 18%, their value-add products, namely yarns, attract GST at the rate of 12%. Thus, there exists an inversion at fibre to yarn stage. Fabrics, however, attract GST at the rate of 5%.
The textiles sector currently has a differential GST rate of 5, 12 and 18%. This leads to difficulty in issuing and claiming of refunds.
With regard to footwear, the Council in June last year had lowered GST rate to 5% on items worth up to ₹1,000, while those above this value attract 18% duty. However, inputs used by the sector attract GST rate in the range of 5-18%.
EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said, “An increase in the rate of GST for some of these products should help liquidating the accumulated credits and thereby bettering the working capital costs for businesses manufacturing these goods. However, the rate increase on these goods may result in price hike and, thereby, may impact demand of these goods.”
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said, “Economy is going through a rough patch and any further increase in tax rates would run negative sentiment throughout the entire sector and push the demands further down deteriorating the overall economic stability in the country.”",business

Theatres, however, will not be closed like in Kerala, unless they get a clear health directive from the Government.
After the new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed and the total count of Indian patients shot up to 60 plus, fear has gripped people. Kannada cinema is also hit by the new virus and screens across the state wear a deserted look.
Regardless of the virus threat, as many four Kannada films, including Shivarjuna, Naragunda Bandaaya, Ambaani Putra, and Hulidurga are hitting screens today.
Of the four films, Naragunda Bandaya is drawing attention as it is a fictionalised version of the historic revolt of farmers of Naragunda. In 1980, two farmers were killed in police firing during an agitation against betterment of levy imposed for water. Nagendra Magadi fictionalised this incident. Raksh and Shubha Pujna play lead characters.
Umesh Banakar, the vice-president of Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) has observed that the number of the audience is dwindling, especially in Bengaluru. Regardless of the quality of the film and prestigious banners, film goers are thinking twice before they set foot in multiplexes and single screens.
Kannada cinema, which faces competition from other language films, dubbed films from Hollywood etc. is now further threatened by the wave of misinformation on social media, Banakar said. Though over 60 plus films have been released in the last 70 days, only four succeeded in recovering their investment, says a source in KFCC.
Admitting that there is a significant decrease in the number of audience coming to watch films, KV Chandrashekar, of Veeresh Theatre says, “There is a 25% drop in the audience.” Sources in KFCC disclosed that; films such as Baaghi-3 and Dhrona starring Shivarajkumar have also been affected to a great extent because of the virus. The release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, has been postponed.
Will film screenings be suspended in Karnataka too after Kerala? “The situation here has not reached the stage of suspending the screening of films. We will take a call only if the government issues a directive in this regard,” asserts Jairaj, President of KFCC.",movies
"It’s not an easy film to watch, says Tymur Yashchenko of his debut feature",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/its-not-an-easy-film-to-watch-says-tymur-yashchenko-of-his-debut-feature/article31049069.ece,"“It is not an easy film to watch; it’s not for everyone. The highest mark for me as a director is when people either love or hate the film,” says Tymur Yashchenko, of his debut feature, U311 Cherkasy, which was screened at BiFFes. Tymur had earlier made the short, Lev, a prologue to U311 Cherkasy. 
Based on true events, the film follows two men, Mishko and Lev, serving on the minesweeper Cherkasy. The crew of the ship resisted seizure by Russian forces during the annexure of Crimea in 2014 before ultimately being captured. It was the last Ukrainian military vessel in Donuzlav Lake, Crimea, to be seized by the Russian Navy. 
The affable Tymur sat down with MetroPlus for a chat. 
Excerpts.
I think I received the energy after the Revolution of Dignity (2014) when we kicked out President Viktor Yanukovych. That energy was just waiting for realisation. Then I read that the Cherkasy was resisting in Crimea. I’m from Cherkasy, it is my hometown. I started checking and became interested in this story about the ships being blocked and resisting. I watched a one-minute YouTube video that sailors from another ship had put up one day before the Cherkasy was seized. The sailors are holding sticks and singing a hymn of the Maidan (the resistance). I saw how the sailors looked, they were fighting and singing. It is really Ukrainian to fight and sing (laughs). When I watched the video, I clearly felt that this has to be my debut.







The film is about self-identification. It is not political; politics is in the background for me. I was trying to show the collective image of the Ukranian Navy but I went much deeper and tried to show a portrait of Ukraine. It is just a lot of my love, a lot of my support and a lot of me as a Ukrainian. 
When I was young, there were a lot of Indian films on Soviet television and I was in love with commercial films like Seeta Aur Geeta. Indian films are very honest; I appreciate the passion, the music and the songs. And I love Indian culture; it is very similar to Ukraine. We also love to sing and we are also emotional people.",movies
Black sheep should not be allowed to use religion as a crutch: Neeraj Pandey ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/black-sheep-should-not-be-allowed-to-use-religion-as-a-crutch-neeraj-pandey/article31048774.ece,"As the Parliament Attack of 2001 refuses to fade away from public memory, writer-director-producer Neeraj Pandey, known for his thrillers set against real incidents of terror, is making his web debut with a story that spirals from the incident. Called Special Ops, it is premiering on Hotstar on March 17. 






A poster of the series
 






“It was a shocking incident for the country and it is imperative that we don’t forget and draw lessons from it. When we were researching for Baby (2015), I got a tidbit of information on the Parliament Attack. Over the years, it developed into a story and kept returning to me,” says Pandey, as he opens up on the project, headlined by Kay Kay Menon. The senior actor plays an intelligence officer Himmat Singh who is in search of the mastermind behind a series of terror attacks in India in the last 19 years, starting with the Parliament Attack where five terrorists were gunned down on the spot.
The recent developments have indicated the involvement of a Jammu and Kashmir police officer in the case. Pandey says the role of Davinder Singh has emerged in the last couple of months. 
“We have been working for the last two years but it is very interesting that new details are coming out. There are a lot of question marks on how it happened and why it happened. As for our story, it starts from a real backdrop and then builds into an organic fictional narrative,” he clarifies. “Himmat Singh believes that there is something that doesn’t meet the eye and that there was a sixth guy as well and follows him with remarkable tenacity,” adds Pandey.
Advertently or inadvertently, such narratives often put one religion in the dock. “I don’t think religion comes in the way of my narratives,” says Pandey, who shot to fame with A Wednesday. “Right from the first film, it is always about the offender,” he remarks. One reminds him of a staple situation that occurs in such thrillers where a guy explains the true meaning of Islam to an offender even as the writer juxtaposes a good Muslim against a bad Muslim. “See, such scenes emerge in the narrative when somebody distorts the true meaning of Islam,” counters Pandey.
It is true and it adds to layers, but we don’t get to see such black sheep on the other side of the spectrum. And even if they are, they don’t get any lesson on the true meaning of Hindusim. “I agree. It should be about black sheep on both sides and they should not be allowed to use religion as a crutch,” admits Pandey.
Sometimes, clips of his films are used to push a jingoistic agenda. “That’s terrible, but there is very little we could do once the film is out. It is used for memes and pushing agendas...but I think the audience is smart enough to distinguish between the intention of the director and the intention of people who misuse it.”
Shot in three different countries, promos suggest that the scale of the eight-part series is huge. “Let’s not see the digital medium as a smaller medium or look at it in a patronising way. We didn’t want to become content filling company judged by the number of hours of programming. It is exciting for us what we are offering is no less than what audience watch on the big screen.”
If a Neeraj Pandey thriller could be watched on a laptop, who would venture out to queue up at the box office. “There will be interesting stories that would not require more than two hours to tell. I will continue to make them for the big screen,” he justifies. Pandey, who has a novel to his credit, says writing a web series is like writing a novel. “I won’t say it is better than writing films. It is exciting and challenging. Here, like a novel, you can put the main strand on a pause, and digress a bit.” 
Pandey agrees it is hard to eke out information from India’s security apparatus. “Most of the information is classified but like good journalists, we keep chasing stories. Most officers don’t open up, but a few do,” he chuckles.
After Special Ops, Pandey is gearing up for a historical film on Chanakya. These days many people are looking for a modern-day Chanakya but Pandey clarifies that he is only focussing on the Chanakya who is a towering figure of our ancient history. “It was Chandraprakash Dwivediji who got the idea in my head. His knowledge and experience have come into play,” he says, referring to the director who made a popular teleseries on Chanakya for Doordarshan in 1990.
Pandey says he is not following a trend. “It has been with me for six-seven years. At that time, there was no trend and the technology to mount such an ambitious project was either not there or was very expensive.”
He promises not to look at the past from the prism of today. “It is about an important period in our history when the characters had their share of problems. Having said that Chanakya was a great mind and you find him as relevant as he was then.”
On casting Ajay Devgn as Chanakya, Pandey says the actor was the first choice. “His body of work speaks for itself.” Will he make him put on weight as the popular image of Chanakya is that of a portly intellectual? “It is too early to talk about such details but I guess there is no strong visual image of Chanakya. Many aspects of his life have been poorly documented. We are trying to do as much research as possible,” he sums up.",movies
Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary ‘Get Back’ to release in September,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/peter-jacksons-beatles-documentary-get-back-to-release-in-september/article31048696.ece,"The Walt Disney Studios has acquired the worldwide distribution rights to acclaimed filmmaker Peter Jackson’s previously announced Beatles documentary Get Back, which will release in September.
The film will showcase the warmth, camaraderie and humour of the making of the legendary band’s studio album, Let It Be, and their final live concert as a group, the iconic rooftop performance on London’s Savile Row. 
The Beatles: Get Back will be released by The Walt Disney Studios in the US and Canada on September 4, additional details and dates for the film’s global release to follow. The announcement was made on March 11 by Robert A. Iger, Executive Chairman, The Walt Disney Company, at Disney’s annual meeting of shareholders.
“No band has had the kind of impact on the world that The Beatles have had, and The Beatles: Get Back is a front-row seat to the inner workings of these genius creators at a seminal moment in music history, with spectacularly restored footage that looks like it was shot yesterday,” said Iger, adding: “I’m a huge fan myself, so I could not be happier that Disney is able to share Peter Jackson’s stunning documentary with global audiences in September.”
The Beatles: Get Back will be presented by The Walt Disney Studios in association with Apple Corps Ltd. and WingNut Films Productions Ltd.
Compiled from over 55 hours of unseen footage, filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and 140 hours of mostly unheard audio recordings from the Let It Be album sessions, The Beatles: Get Back is directed by Jackson and produced by Jackson, Clare Olssen and Jonathan Clyde, with Ken Kamins and Apple Corps’ Jeff Jones serving as executive producers.
The music in the film will be mixed by Giles Martin and Sam Okell at Abbey Road Studios in London. With the restoration behind it, The Beatles: Get Back will create a vivid, joyful and immersive experience for audiences.
Talking about the film, Peter Jackson said: “Working on this project has been a joyous discovery. I’ve been privileged to be a fly on the wall while the greatest band of all time works, plays and creates masterpieces. I’m thrilled that Disney have stepped up as our distributor. There’s no one better to have our movie seen by the greatest number of people.”
To this, McCartney added: “I am really happy that Peter has delved into our archives to make a film that shows the truth about The Beatles recording together. The friendship and love between us comes over and reminds me of what a crazily beautiful time we had.”
Ringo Starr shared: “I’m really looking forward to this film. Peter is great and it was so cool looking at all this footage. There was hours and hours of us just laughing and playing music, not at all like the version that came out. There was a lot of joy and I think Peter will show that. I think this version will be a lot more peace and loving, like we really were.”
The Beatles: Get Back features the footage of the band at work in the studio, capturing John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr as they create their now-classic songs from scratch, laughing, bantering and playing to the camera. 
A fully restored version of the original Let It Be film will be made available at a later date.",movies
Hollywood reacts to Harvey Weinstein sentencing: ‘It’s the power of people who speak up’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hollywood-reacts-to-harvey-weinstein-sentencing-its-the-power-of-people-who-speak-up/article31048557.ece,"Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault, and the women who accused the disgraced Hollywood mogul welcomed the verdict, terming it as the victory of the justice system and the “power of people who speak up”.
Weinstein, who has been accused of violating scores of women, was convicted last month of raping a once-aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on former TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi at his apartment in 2006.
 The producer behind Oscar-winning films as Shakespeare in Love and Pulp Fiction was the first prominent Hollywood name to be accused for his alleged predatory behaviour in the bombshell expose by The New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on October 5, 2017, followed by Ronan Farrow’s piece in The New Yorker on October 10.

Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison




 

Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison

The report sparked off the #MeToo movement, which empowered survivors of sexual assault, abuse and rape to raise their voice and hold the perpetrators responsible.
 Actor Mira Sorvino, who was one of the first to go on record to accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, said she cried “tears of amazement and gratitude” after the sentence was pronounced.
“23 years. Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for his crimes of rape and sexual assault. I literally cried tears of amazement, gratitude that the justice system has worked on behalf of all of his victims today,” Sorvino tweeted Wednesday.
 The Silence Breakers group, which has spoken out against sexual harassment and assault and includes several Weinstein accusers like actors Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd, released a statement after his sentencing.
“Harvey Weinstein’s legacy will always be that he’s a convicted rapist. He is going to jail — but no amount of jail time will repair the lives he ruined, the careers he destroyed, or the damage he has caused. The Silence Breaker community was founded on solidarity, support and compassion. The New York trial has ended, but the Silence Breakers will persist in our crusade for cultural change, justice and to have our voices heard,” the statement read. 
Farrow tweeted about the power of those who speak up.
“A lot of news underlines how hard it is to hold wealthy and connected people accountable. Today’s shows the power of people who speak up, from a position of far less power, at great personal risk. 
“The Weinstein sentence reminds us of the importance of those sources and of leaders at news organizations who refused to kill the story-including the editors at the New Yorker who published the first allegations of rape and assault about Weinstein,” he tweeted.
 More than 90 women, including Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong’o, Lea Seydoux and Uma Thurman, eventually came forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault and sexual harassment after the news expose.
 Rosanna Arquette, another member of The Silence Breakers, paid gratitude to McGowan, one of the first women to call out Weinstein, among scores of other “brave” women who broke their silence.
“Gratitude to all the silence breakers especially Rose and all survivors of weinstein to the brave women who testified and to the incredible investigative reporting of Ronan Farrow who uncovered the sabotage and spying and to David Remnick thank you Rich McKuen and NY Times,” she wrote on the microblogging site.
 After the sentencing, Kate Beckinsale recounted a 2001 incident with Weinstein that left her in tears. In 2017, the Underworld star accused the producer of inappropriate advances when she was a teenager.
 In a lengthy Instagram post, the actor detailed a meeting with Weinstein that occurred a day after the New York premiere of Serendipity.
“These photos were taken at the premiere of Serendipity on October 5, 2001. We all refused to go because holding a premiere mere weeks after 9/11 with the city still smoking felt like the most insensitive, tone deaf, disrespectful idea possible,” she said. 
Beckinsale said Weinstein “insisted” on the premiere, and the morning after, Beckinsale and her toddler daughter Lily were invited to his home for a playdate with Weinstein’s daughter. 
She said the producer rained profanities at her for “ruining” the film’s premiere by not wearing a short, tight dress.
 The actor said Weinstein’s sentencing was “a huge relief to me on behalf of all the women he sexually assaulted or raped, and I hope will be a deterrent to that sort of behavior in this and any other industry.” 
Actor Olivia Munn, who was one of six women who came forward with sexual harassment and assault accusations against filmmaker Brett Ratner in the wake of #MeToo, hailed the Weinstein accusers for creating a “huge shift” in the world.
“To the women who bravely testified against Weinstein + the Silence Breakers who courageously told their stories unsure of what repercussions might unfold: Your strength & resilience created a huge shift in the world and empowered millions of people. Myself included. Thank You,” the X-Men: Apocalypse star said in a tweet.
 Time’s Up, the organisation which was born out of the Weinstein expose, thanked all the women who testified in court against the producer for their courage.
“First and foremost, we are grateful for the courage and strength of Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, and Lauren Young, who bravely testified in court, and we remain in solidarity with the more than 100 survivors who suffered abuse, harassment, and rape at the hands of Harvey Weinstein. The trauma of sexual assault and harassment is lifelong — we can only hope that today’s sentence brings all of the survivors of Harvey Weinstein some measure of peace,” Tina Tchen, president and chief executive officer of the foundation, said in a statement.
 Weinstein was acquitted of the more serious charges against him of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault.
 Now that the executive has been sentenced, his lawyers can move forward with a promised appeal. ",movies
Ekta Mittal’s new film looks at myriad moods of migration ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ekta-mittals-new-film-looks-at-myriad-moods-of-migration/article31048355.ece,"Presenting the pain of separation, Ekta Mittal’s Gumnaam Din depicts the journey of migrant workers who get lost in the urban jungles. Produced by the Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT), the film was screened in the Shorts category at the recent Berlin International Film Festival. Migration is not a new subject for Ekta. She has made Birha, a feature-length documentary on the lives of people who leave their homes in search of a better life. 






Ekta Mittal
 






“Gumnaam Din is part of a longer film and multimedia project called Behind the Tinsheets which looks at the inner worlds of migrant workers building cities. This is the fifth film under the project produced by PSBT,” says Ekta.
“After working on three films set in Bangaluru, I felt the urge to go back to the families of workers across different parts of the country,” adds the filmmaker, who works at Maraa, a media and arts collective in Bangaluru. An interesting aspect of the 27-minute film is its form. It is inspired by Shiv Kumar Batalvi’s poem by the same title which translates loosely to “Missing Days”. “The film is a response to the mood and metaphor this poem which touched upon grief and separation. For me, Batalvi’s poems are dreams and visions of the pain and suffering caused by separation and longing. His poems guided me in representing stories of the families and workers I met along the journey of making this film,” explains Ekta.
Editing the film, says Ekta, was a “great exercise of moving away from structured ways of working on a narrative and arriving at our own logic of creating a landscape of waiting and uncertainty.” “I work closely with my crew to arrive at the visual treatment but I also rely on my dreams for clues for sound and visual,” she notes.
Edited excerpts:
Tell us about the poetic form of the film. Usually, such subjects are dealt with journalistic tools.
I deliberately chose to stay away from the journalistic tone because I wanted to indulge the viewer in the days of the missing person. I tried to show the silence, the lamentation, the waiting and the ethos around the missing person. Besides I wanted to address undocumented, unaccounted and unregistered disappearances that comprise the mysterious trajectories of migration in the country.
How did Shiv Kumar Batalvi’s birha poetry comes into your life? How did you connect it with the cinematic form in Gumnaam Din — a Punjabi poet giving voice to the separation felt by the migrant workers from Bihar.
I stumbled upon him by chance when I was trying to think of the form of my film which I knew was not a film filled with facts and figures. I wanted to be attentive to the pain and grief that people endure when they lose or they are unsure if someone they love would ever return; the strength of survival is derived from shared experiences of everyday life. For this, I turned to poetry and found some of his early poems online and his interview that moved me. While I was familiar with birha poetry, his poetry particularly guided me further in my production. I found his poems to be metaphorical and visually rich. His poems are like visual essays in themselves. And the film is a response to his poem, not literally but keeping in mind the essence and mood of it but in the context of migration.
Both Batalvi and the film talk about the loss of identity, which has a contemporary ring to it. How do you see it?
The loss of identity that comes with migration in India speaks to obscurity – of not being counted, going missing from the official registers. In Batalvi’s poetry, it seems to me, there is a voluntary acceptance of gloom and alienation caused by unknown reasons. The poem resonates with the states of mind of several people who are about to leave, who are on the road and who have left for good and perhaps those who are deemed to be missing. The poem and the film meet on a suspension of time, location and identity.
Tell us about the reflection of a woman dressing up? Some could see it as a stereotype of a woman waiting for her partner…
She could be someone waiting for someone else, not necessarily her husband. She could be remembering the act of dressing. Without a word, she gets ready for something we can only imagine. It is an everyday act. She is beautiful. Fearless. Aware. Here I wish to move away from the classical representation of the woman waiting for her man, in fact, her presence is open for speculation in the film. Her expression can be interpreted in more ways than one. Once, during my research, a woman told me that the greatest ability of a woman is to forget. 
One of the most moving scenes is the wails of women filling the atmosphere...How did it come about?
This comes from a personal experience. I witnessed in Bihar and mistook it for an animal. The women led me to a room where I saw a mother and daughter in a deep embrace wailing loudly. They told me every time a daughter visits her mother and when it is time for her to leave back to her husband's house, she embraces her mother and wails – to share that which cannot be articulated in words. This is the only time she is free to express what she feels.
What is the purpose of using the missing person’s voice to describe him? In a sense, it takes away the mystery and in another, it adds to it…
This was my voice, hoping desperately that the missing person I was looking for wishes to be found. It is also open for speculation and interpretation. Would a missing person want to be found? How would he or she reach out? 
How was the response at the Berlinale?
It was overwhelming and humbling at the same time. A great opportunity for me to see the film on beautiful large screens. To see a packed house every day was rewarding. I was also delighted to be part of a programme that delved upon similar themes from different approaches and in different contexts.",movies

Users were confused yesterday when a simple update of the app changed the logo and they had access to the wide catalogue of Disney titles, 18 days before the rebranding was supposed to happen, but they welcomed the surprise happily.
However, now, the rollback comes as a rude shock, and consumers who started watching some of the shows, are clearly not happy, judging by social media.
A new prompted update also reverts the Disney+ Hotstar logo to the updated Hotstar logo, that is blue in colour.

"Tovino Thomas on 'Kilometers and Kilometers', an actor's need for fitness, and being a movie buff",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tovino-thomas-on-kilometers-and-kilometers-an-actors-need-for-fitness-and-being-a-movie-buff/article31040067.ece,"From minor roles, Tovino Thomas has battled his way to the top in Malayalam cinema. His performances in movies such as Ennu Ninte Moideen, Guppy, Godha, Mayaanadhi, Theevandi and Lucifer have helped him make a mark. After last month’s Forensic, Tovino has Kilometers and Kilometers (of which he is one of the producers) that is releasing soon. The actor is currently shooting for the role of a super hero in Basil Joseph’s Minnal Murali.
Excerpts from an interview with the actor:
Why made you take up Forensic?
I heard the thread of Forensic during Lucifer’s shoot. The director duo of the film (Akhil Paul and Anas Khan) gave me updated drafts after each discussion. A lot of research has gone into the film as there are several scientific aspects to this story. It was the storyline that hooked me.
You do back-to-back movies. Is this part of a game plan?
Every time I listen to an exciting story, I want to be a part of it. You can’t guarantee that all the movies you do become hits even if you are really selective. I believe in following my instinct. I did take a break to spend time with my family before joining Forensic. As Minnal Murali needs about 120 days of shoot, I won’t be doing any other projects in between.
Does an image come in the way of exploring different characters?
Honestly, I don’t think I have such an image. I have done just a limited number of romances. I have been playing characters of all shades, that too of varying lengths.
Is social media a boon or a bane?
We could be different from what is depicted on our social media profiles! Moreover, we only post whatever we want others to see, like promotional material, interesting occasions and so on.
How easy is it to slip in and out of the skin of your characters, especially when you are doing so many in a row?
There is a lot of homework involved and pains taken to shape each character. I make it a point to make my characters different, not just in looks but in their mannerisms as well. All this is done after thorough discussions with the team. I became part of Minnal Murali soon after wrapping up Forensic. My get-up in both the movies is entirely different.
Pictures of your workout sessions for Minnal Murali went viral...
Minnal Murali discovers super powers after being struck by lightning. Although there are no ‘shirtless scenes’ in the movie, I felt I needed to look good even with a shirt on. I need to have a good physique to look convincing as a super hero. I will be continuing my workout as I have to look younger than my age in Muhsin Parari’s Thallumaala. The workout regime for Muhsin’s film will be more rigorous from now on and the diet will be different.
How important is physical fitness for an actor?
A certain level of awareness about fitness is essential for every human being. When it comes to an actor, the need for fitness and the kind of shape you need to be in depend on the characters you are doing. The exercise routine we do changes accordingly. If I am focusing on hypertrophy (putting on muscles) now, it was for the need to bulk up for Kalki. Earlier, I had to lose weight considerably for Theevandi as my character was of a man in his 20s. I used to run a lot and was on a crash diet during that period. I am someone who remains in the character that I am playing during the entire shoot. As I keep changing my looks for various roles, what I see in the mirror helps me get into the character easily.
Is there a sense of insecurity among actors as the fate of a couple of movies can decide his/her standing in the industry?
I can’t speak for others. I was a rank outsider when I entered this industry. I have reached where I am by doing minor roles and guest appearances before donning characters with shades of grey before moving on to lead roles. I believe that if I am good enough and have the talent, I will be a part of the industry for a long time.
You are a movie buff. What is the experience like when you watch your own movies?
Well, I can’t watch it objectively. I am the kind of actor who visits the film location even on days when I don’t have a shoot. So when I watch them later on screen, all those memories will be in my mind. While watching movies that I am not part of, I am totally immersed in the narrative, often not even focusing on the technical aspects.
What is your character in 'Kilometers and Kilometers'?
I play Josemon, a villager. He has to shoulder various responsibilities after the death of his father. The story is about his journey from Kerala to Khardung La, with an American lady.
Are there any new projects outside Mollywood, after 'Maari 2'?

India’s current account deficit narrows to $1.4 billion in December quarter ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-current-account-deficit-narrows-to-14-bln-in-december-quarter/article31050409.ece," India’s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed sharply to $1.4 billion or 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the December quarter, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on March 12.

The deficit was at 2.7% of the GDP in the year-ago period and 0.9% in the preceding quarter.
The sharp contraction was primarily due to a lower trade deficit at $34.6 billion, and a rise in net services receipts, the central bank said.
The CAD is a critical indicator of the macroeconomic health and represents the gap between the overall foreign exchange expended and received in the economy.
The data also comes on a day when the rupee depreciated to a 17-month low of 74.24 against the U.S. dollar.
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, the CAD has narrowed to 1% of the GDP.",economy

Also read | SBI to buy 725 crore shares of Yes Bank at Rs.10 per share
In a letter written to Chief Secretaries of all States, the central bank said moving deposits out of private sector banks could have implications for banking and financial sector stability.
The letter came after reports suggested that some State governments have advised government bodies and other entities under their jurisdiction to transfer their funds held with private sector banks to public sector lenders. This follows the crisis at Yes Bank where the RBI has superseded the bank’s board and placed restrictions on withdrawals.
“We strongly believe that such a move can have banking and financial sector stability implications,” the RBI wrote. “We feel that apprehension on the safety of deposits in private sector banks is highly misplaced and will not be in the interest of stability of the financial system in general and the banking system in particular.”

It requested State governments to reconsider any decision they might have taken in this regard or are in the process of taking such decision.
“The Reserve Bank has adequate powers to regulate and supervise the private sector banks and by using these powers, it has ensured that the depositors’ money is entirely safe,” the letter said.

The RBI said the resolution of weak private sector banks in the past has been done in a manner that the depositors are not put to loss.
“It is precisely with a view to retaining depositors’ confidence in private sector banks and mitigating their hardship that, after the imposition of a moratorium on Yes Bank Ltd, the RBI has drawn up a draft scheme without any delay and we are making every effort to expedite the finalisation of the scheme,” it added.",economy

The Indian benchmarks registered their biggest single-day fall on Thursday, with the Sensex plunging 2,919.26 points, or 8.18%, to close at 32,778.14 — over 22% lower than its January high of 42,273.87. This was the lowest close for the index in nearly two years.
All 30 stocks in the Sensex ended the day with deep losses, with heavyweights such as HDFC Bank, TCS, Axis Bank, ONGC, State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank shedding over 9% each on Thursday. Most of the Sensex constituents touched their 52-week lows.
The dampened investor sentiments could be further gauged from the fact that more than 500 stocks touched their lower circuit on the BSE, even as 2,265 stocks ended in the red as against only 201 gainers.
Data | Where does the March 9 market crash rank in Sensex history?
The broader Nifty fell below the psychological 10,000 mark to close at its lowest level since June 2017. The index lost 868.25 points, or 8.30%, to close at 9,590.15.
The India VIX index jumped over 31% after witnessing a jump of 35% on Monday last.







 
The announcement by President Donald Trump restricting travel to the U.S. from Europe further dented investor sentiments.
“Global stocks, including India, plunged into a bear market after President Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to stem the coronavirus, threatening more disruption to the world economy,” said Deepak Jasani, Head-Retail Research, HDFC Securities. “Global recession risk is rising and the markets do not seem to be pricing that in fully,” he added.

The event has been delayed, not cancelled, so defending champion Tiger Woods, who is battling a back issue, may get the chance to capture a 16th Major at the famed course at some future date.
The outbreak, which has prompted a virtual shutdown of American sport, also forced Ridley to postpone the Augusta National women's amateur and youth drive, chip and putt national finals.
“Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision,” Ridley said. s“We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters tournament and our amateur events at some later date,” he said.
Augusta National typically closes soon after hosting the world's top players, reopening later each year, so the possibility remains that it could be rescheduled later in the year, potentially after the 2019-20 USPGA season is complete given the schedule already booked through August.",other sports

India needs to pay more attention to badminton doubles: Jwala Gutta,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/india-needs-to-pay-more-attention-to-badminton-doubles-jwala-gutta/article31059296.ece,"“We cannot have just two or three ace players and expect them to win all the medals. We are a population of a billion people, we have the capability to produce more players,” says badminton player, Jwala Gutta. The shuttler was in town to attend the silver jubilee celebrations of The Presidential School.
Talking to Metroplus, the Arjuna Awardee says that having more badminton academies is the need of the hour. “More academies will make the sport accessible to a larger group of people. This will also create healthy competition among the sportspersons and help them get better at the game,” she says.
The player is coming up with her own academy, Jwala Gutta's Global Academy for Badminton that is all set to open in a month’s time in Hyderabad. “Apart from singles, the academy will also focus on doubles game. India needs to pay more attention to doubles. Unfortunately, we prioritise singles game despite doubles being an important part of badminton. In doubles, game co-ordination and understanding plays a major role along with techniques and game plan. The co-ordination comes only if players are trained together,”adds Jwala who represented India in badminton doubles.
Speaking about her role at the academy Jwala says that she will oversee the running of the academy and play the mentor. “I cannot be a coach because I am not trained for it. I would rather put my efforts and expertise in ensuring that the best of facilities are available there,” says the 36-year-old. 
A note of adviceWith over two decades of experience in badminton under her belt, Jwala advises the upcoming players: “There will always be shortcuts, and unfortunately they look very tempting. But nothing can make you a champion except hardwork. So be patient about the long training and practice sessions as that is the only way to ace your game.”
A resident of Hyderabad, Jwala has fond memories associated with Visakhapatnam. “I played my first ever nationals in this city when I was just 11 years old. After that, I have played several other tournaments here. Every time I came here, I would take long walks along the beach. It helped me calm down, especially days before the tournaments when I was under a lot of pressure,” she adds.
Jwala who retired from the sport almost two years ago, says that she is enjoying life at a slower pace now. “I have been playing since the age of eight or nine years old. Since then my routine has always been busy with academics and practice. My day used to begin at break of dawn but now I like waking up leisurely and spending time at home,” she says. Jwala spends her time catching up on web series and movies. “Currently, I am hooked to this Netflix series called Locke and key,” she adds. 
Talking about the upcoming Olympics in Tokyo, she says that her hopes are pinned on PV Sindhu who might get home a medal. ",other sports
No work from home for Facebook contract workers: Report,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/no-work-from-home-for-facebook-contract-workers-report/article31057716.ece,"
In a somewhat discriminatory gesture, Facebook has reportedly banned its contractual workers (third-party content moderators) from work out of home, and has instead encouraged regular staff to avail themselves of work-from-home option amid new coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.
According to The Interceptor, many contract workers said that “contrary to statements to them from Facebook, they are barred by their actual employers from working from home, despite the technical feasibility and clear public health benefits of doing so.”
Facebook has hired contractors employed by Accenture and Wipro and most of those are content moderators.
These workers said they’ve been told that the only way they can stay home is by using the paid time off (PTO) days they’re allotted each year.
“Most people here are sick, coughing, and sneezing. The office ran out of Clorox wipes,” the workers were quoted as saying in the report on Thursday.
“One Accenture employee told The Intercept that their entire team of over 20 contractors had been told that they were not permitted to work from home to avoid infection.”
In fact, Facebook had to shut its Seattle office after one of its contractors tested positive for COVID-19. According to Tracy Clayton, a Facebook spokesperson, a contractor based in the Stadium East Office was diagnosed with coronavirus.
The social media giant has “strongly recommended all its workers in the Bay Area to work from home.”
According to a company spokesperson, “there is some work that cannot be done from home for content reviewers, some of this work must be done from the office for safety, privacy and legal reasons.”
“We’re exploring work-from-home options on a temporary basis, and have already enabled it in some locations,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
According to a post from an Austin Facebook contractor, Accenture “is only sending home people who exhibit flu-like symptoms in the workplace.”",technology
Coronavirus: Is your organisation ready for work from home in India?,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/coronavirus-is-your-organisation-ready-for-work-from-home-in-india/article31057675.ece,"As the coronavirus pandemic spreads rapidly across the world, more and more companies are embracing the work-from-home option for business continuity.
While Twitter has taken the “unprecedented step” of making work from home mandatory, e-commerce major Flipkart has encouraged young parents in Bengaluru to work remotely.
But are all organisations ready to embrace the work-from-home culture in view of the growing restrictions due to the spread of the virus?
Obviously not, especially those organisations whose nature of business demands a lot of travel and face-to-face interactions. An Ola or Uber driver would hardly be able to make money by sitting at home.
The availability of advanced digital tools, however, allows a large number of organisations to implement work from home — if they plan well.
Flipkart, for example said it is checking system preparedness for working remotely using digital/video tools.
“We are promoting the use of video conferences for meetings, including job interviews, and are temporarily avoiding events and training programmes that require large gatherings as a precautionary measure,” the e-commerce major said in a statement.
Some companies have even started mock drills to test their work from home capabilities.

Examples are fintech company Zeta and messaging and collaboration tool Flock.
Among the measures announced by the two companies include virtual on-boarding for outstation candidates and virtual interviewing and hiring to the extent possible with digitisation of some of their processes, including signing of employment contract, educational and awareness sessions on health and fitness through online mediums to ensure their health is not compromised even as they work from home, said Bhavin Turakhia, Founder and CEO at Flock and Co-founder and CEO at ZETA.
As a result of the measures introduced with the aim of restricting travel and face-to-face interaction in the face of dangers due to coronavirus, the demand for video-conferencing tools has gone up in India.
Networking giant Cisco said it has seen “significant growth” in the usage of its web conferencing and video-conferencing service Webex in India.
“Cisco has always prioritised the enablement of people to work from anywhere, any time, and on any device so they stay connected with their teams and can continue their business operations,” Cisco said in a statement shared with IANS.
“Since the outbreak began, there has been a 22x increase of traffic on the Webex backbone connecting China-based Webex users to their global workplaces. Significant growth in the usage of Webex in India has also been observed,” it said.
In light of the coronavirus outbreak, Cisco has expanded the capabilities on its free Webex offer in all countries where it is available.
“This comes with the additional features of unlimited usage (no time restrictions) and supporting of up to 100 participants,” the company added.
Google, earlier this month, said that in Hong Kong and Vietnam, where schools have already been closed, it has seen hundreds of thousands of students start using both Hangouts Meet, its video-conferencing tool available to all G Suite users, and Google Classroom, to join classes and continue their schooling remotely from home.
“And, as more businesses adjust their work-from-home policies and adopt reduced travel plans in response to COVID-19, we’re helping to ensure that all globally distributed teams can still reliably meet face to face, even if employees are not in the same location,” Javier Soltero, General Manager and VP, G Suite, said in a blog post.
Google has started rolling out free access to its advanced Hangouts Meet video-conferencing capabilities to all G Suite and G Suite for Education customers globally, including larger meetings, for up to 250 participants per call, live streaming for up to 1,00,000 viewers within a domain and the ability to record meetings and save them to Google Drive.
Typically available in the Enterprise edition of G Suite and in G Suite Enterprise for Education, these features will be available at no additional cost to all customers until July 1, Google said.

"Raveena Tandon champions Prince Charles’ ‘namaste’, tells ABC News to ‘do some homework’",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/raveena-tandon-champions-prince-charles-namaste-tells-abc-news-to-do-some-homework/article31059706.ece,"ABC News called the Indian namaste, a ‘prayer-like gesture’ when Prince Charles used it recently during a public event, instead of shaking hands, as a measure advocated to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
As the tweet and accompanying video did the rounds on social media, it didn’t go down too well with Indian users, and finally Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon asked the channel to do their research properly, in response to the post.
 

It’s a “Namaste”. Do some homework @ABC https://t.co/OUI9nTtDob— Raveena Tandon (@TandonRaveena) March 12, 2020 


 
It’s a “Namaste”. Do some homework @ABC https://t.co/OUI9nTtDob
Sharing the original ABC News tweet, Raveena stated, “It’s a “Namaste”. Do some homework @ABC.”
Just hours after her tweet, actor-singer Priyanka Chopra also posted a video of herself doing the ‘namaste’ on different public occasions and wrote, “It’s all about the Namaste. An old but also new way to greet people in a time of change around the world. Please stay safe everyone!”

The conservationist and tree saver,https://www.thehindu.com/society/tree-saviour-tree-doctor/article31062477.ece,"Former chief justice MN Venkatachaliah once jokingly said in a gathering, “To think of Vijay Nishanth just as a tree lover is incomplete. Seeing his love for the woody perennials I strongly feel he must have been a beautiful tree in his previous birth. He is an urban conservationist who can hear the language of trees.”
In one exceptionally horrifying case a few years ago in Marathalli, someone had poisoned 17 trees that were blocking two hoardings. “The trees burned for 20 days before 14 of them succumbed. I was so speechless seeing them suffer, all I could do was shed tears silently at home,” says Vijay going emotional, although he managed to rejuvenate three of them. And what was his healing therapy? The first aid includes removing the poison by scrapping away the charred parts and applies a liquid bandage of beeswax and orange oil on their trunks. Vijay later celebrated rakhi with the ‘survivors’ last year. 
Rampant illegal cutting, diseases and pollution-related stress that make trees sick and weak become Vijay’s patients. “Want to know the number of trees that I have saved? Even on a conservative estimate it would be around 1.5 lakh in the last 20 years amongst which I have transplanted nearly 250 until now,” says Vijay better known as Bengaluru’s Tree Doctor. Vijay shows photos of the before-and-after photos of sidewalks transformed by newly planted trees, and poisoned trees he’s brought back to life in several areas of the city.
Vijay believes every tree is valuable. Showing photos of some of the oldest trees at Bannerghatta Road that looked battered, he says, people are heartless, they drill holes and cause pain. Look at their withered innards and decades-old trunk shrinking with blows. Age, weather and human neglect are the reasons they don’t live even half their age. How can I keep quiet, I have to save crores of trees in my lifetime. That’s the best gift I can give to mankind,” he says. 
Vijay who lost his parents even as a toddler grew up at Child Fun Association, a children’s home in Jayanagar. Mary Isaacs, the octogenarian who brought up Vijay moulded him to have a ‘complete personality’ as Vijay puts it. She even nudged him “to follow his dreams” when he wanted to step out of the engineering domain at BNMIT college in 2003. This helped him become an urban conservationist and animal rights activist who was used to identifying trees and picking up their fruits in his childhood. 
Vijay worked as a volunteer for almost a decade at the Forest Cell of Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). That’s when he saw trees being cut off across Bengaluru and the worst was, there was no account of the number of trees being chopped. One day he said “how can we go on without having a track of it?”
Vijay gradually understood the need for a tracking mechanism to be in place. He quit engineering and joined a friend’s company when he got the time to concentrate on environmental issues. “I worked with a software company, which was into mapping houses. But I decided to use my friend S Shariff’s knowledge at the software company who developed an App that could help in the documentation process. I applied his ideas to track the trees that are being chopped through Vruksha.com for an online tree-mapping start-up,” he says. Vijay received financial assistance from Ravi Kumar, another co-founder. 
Concurrently when Bengaluru was being transformed from a garden city to lap up brick and mortar he wanted to learn more about the know-how on healing trees. His mentorship with Harini Nagendra, an author and one of the city’s foremost tree experts, at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (Atree) helped him slide into the subject with more domain knowledge in 2011.
“We are too happy that Vruksha has completed 10 years now,” says Vijay who along with his friends initially tagged 115 trees in Jayanagar ward. They recorded and documented all the trees assessing them on the parameters of species, health condition, and height.
The Vruksha team mapped trees in Jayanagar, Byrasandra, and Pattabhiramanagar. The team recorded the images of trees on iPad. On the website, apart from pictures that denote every kind of tree recorded, Vruksha.com also recommends the options that can be planted on free spaces at different locations. The website also carries a list of endemic and exotic tree species.
Transplantations the key
According to the Karnataka Tree Preservation Act its not only planting and maintaining, but transplanting them which is key to conservation, says Vijay. While the tree man is the local hero, his transplanting work has extended to Hampi, Mysore, Nanjangud, Madhya Pradesh amongst other cities. “Not all species of trees can be transplanted. Mainly about 25 species are the best in the range and that includes Ficus, Peepal, Pongamia, Coppor Pod, Desi Badam, Behandi, and a few varieties of Mango with great difficulty,” says Vijay. To fight fungicides, bacteria and insecticides he uses neem and orange oil, beewax, Honge or Pongamia oil and castor oil apart from a variety of medicated soil depending on a case to case basis. 
And on the tree front Vijay is working on recording the sounds of the trees! Elders always said, don’t chop trees, it hurts. So he thought trees should have an inbuilt voice that has to be tracked on record. “So with a special equipment that I imported from Europe called MIDI, I have started a project “Vriksha Dwani” where some trees in Bangalore Palace are being recorded. The equipment picks the electro magnetic variations and converts them into sound and records it for knowing the Dwani or sound,” explains Vijay who has worked on three tress out of the 50 he will take up. He has demonstrated the process to Maharani Pramoda Devi at the Palace. 
Only in black 
Vijay takes part on Ted talks, speaks to students in schools and colleges, addresses corporate houses and resident welfare associations and reaches out to villagers for advising them on the right plantations according to the demands of soil and climate conditions. As people wait for their ‘tree doctor to arrive” they are shocked to see a young man dressed in black jeans, black T-shirt and a thin black jacket with straight hair flowing over his forehead walking off his Honda Dio scooter. “I am always in black only because any other colour gets dirty as I am always in fields amidst tress,” he laughs.
Social causes 
Recently Vijay’s fight against illegal quarrying in the hilly, deciduous forests of the Bannerghatta National Park has come in focus. He fought successfully to reinstate the no-night-traffic rule through Karnataka’s Bandipur forest area. He is also involved in projects to revive the city’s lakes and has volunteered with BBMP’s forest cell to stop illegal poaching and rehabilitate animals. Vijay is also a consultant for the Army at its lush Madras Engineering Group (MEG) campus in the city’s Ulsoor area where he revived 16 trees. 
Vijay is also the earliest board member of the city’s high court appointed tree committee. He was part of the crowdfunded transplantation of two large trees — a banyan and a peepal — that were coming in the path of an elevated Metro line at the Bannerghatta Road-Jayadeva busy junction. “I was amongst the team with representatives from the Bangalore Metro, the BBMP’s forest cell, the residents of a building and an infrastructure company. We decided to transplant the two trees to the Arekere lake bed 4-kms away and they are in good health even now,” says Vijay. ",society
Lucknow is not just about nawabs and kababs: Madhavi Kuckreja,https://www.thehindu.com/society/lucknow-is-not-just-about-nawabs-and-kababs-madhavi-kuckreja/article31059929.ece,"When Madhavi Kuckreja moved to Lucknow from Karvi, a religious town in Bundelkhand, in 2004, she wanted to experience first-hand the immense cultural wealth of the Uttar Pradesh capital she had heard so much about, especially its array of handmade crafts.
But as she began to explore the city , she was left a little disappointed. She felt the city lacked a navigator, an instrument that connected the dots and showcased its culturally rich places and traditions. The cultural space felt stagnant: the programmes were mostly controlled by the State and the entire history of crafts was locked up in people’s sandooks (trunks), says Kuckreja.
“And there was so much to the city,” she recalls. “We explored the traditions of Muharram. And I found a very strange thing: for instance, how Basant used to be celebrated, but not any longer. People would tell us qissas (anecdotes) about traditions that endure. But not all of this was accessible, especially to the regular visitor.”
Rich diversity
Kuckreja then decided to introduce people to the cultural layers of Lucknow, and 13 years ago opened a crafts bazaar to showcase handicrafts the city was so famous for. Then was born the idea of the Mahindra Sanatkada Lucknow Festival, an annual cultural festival that showcases Awadh and Lucknow, its array of crafts, cuisine, art, tales, literary discourse and much more. Today, Sanatkada, meaning the ‘house of craft’, offers a glimpse into the rich diversity of culture and art in Awadh.
“I don’t know the ‘voila’ moment but we realised that [the festival should be] like a traditional mela (fair), and something the people can own and be involved with,” says Kuckreja, who is CEO of Sanatkada. The century-old Budakki ka Mela on the banks of River Gomti, was a model she wanted to emulate. “Everyone wants to eat, maro adda (gossip), dress up, watch a performance, shop, hear kahanis (stories) — and we knew that qissa goi (storytelling) would happen under the trees here,” she says.
So is she now the navigator for the city? “Yes. In a way. I was like the khoj (scout),” she replies. 
The venues of the Sanatkada have been the Safed Baradari and the Salempur House in Lucknow, chosen as much for their proximity to the heart of the city as for their historicity and architectural splendour. The themes are based both on the pluralistic and inclusive traditions as well as the lesser-known thrills of the city: shama (candle), Basant, pehnava (clothes), bazaars, feminists of Awadh, Filmi duniya mein Awadh (Awadh in the world of cinema), Lucknow ki rachi basi tehzeeb (Lucknow’s composite culture) that breaks the Hindu-Muslim binary myth by showcasing Parsi, Chinese and Bengali traditions) and Francisi Awadhi ta'alluqaat (Awadh’s French connection). 
This year, the festival theme was Awadh ke qasbati rang, the life and culture of the provincial Awadh, beyond Lucknow. If husn-e-karigari (the beauty of artisanship) showcases the crafts of the general folk, reha’ish (abode) is about affluence: bade logo ke bade ghar (the big homes of big people), as Kuckreja puts it. The nankhatai wala, barf ka gola wala (ice candy) and the sikke wala (coin seller) have been part of the festival from the days of the crafts bazaar Kuckreja launched.
The outsider
Kuckreja takes pride in the taur-tarike (manners and modalities), lihaaz (consideration) and the bariki (detailing) while looking at Awadh, be it food, embroidery or etiquette. Kuckreja has played a role in taking Lucknow beyond popular perceptions, pulling out visitors from the tourist circuit hovering around the Imambara and Nawabs, and exposing them to the people’s cultural roots and contemporary realities.“The myth we broke was that Lucknow was just about Nawabs and kababs,” she says.
While she jokingly admits that she continues to battle the outsider tag, ‘the Punjaban in Lucknow’, she nonetheless feels rooted in Lucknow, a city to which she is deeply linked through the feminist and cultural movements. “I mean, my tallaffuz (pronunciation) is always wrong. My adaabs are right and wrong and sometimes I get the jeete raho (a blessing) right. But the thing is, I feel rooted. I feel like I know more about the gali kochis (nooks and corners).” But what does it mean to be rooted? Kuckreja has a simple answer: rishtas or relationships, the inter-personal links she draws with everyday people. It could be the gali  (street) rickshaw wala, who will ask where I want to go, she says. 
In Lucknow, she also encountered the famed Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb but found that communal identities co-existed with traces of this syncretic culture. “I had heard a lot about the Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb. But when I came to the city in 2004, it had become very superficial. I could see a lot of polarisation,” she recalls. 
For instance, she has been told she has ‘too many Muslims’ in her office. But then there is also this other side, stories of co-existence. In old Lucknow’s Chowk area, she observed that both Hindus and Muslims celebrate Dussehra and Muharram by leading elephants and horses in processions in a very similar fashion. 
Then there is Rudauli, the town near Faizabad where a certain Gupta once performed nohas, the Shia lament during Muharram, and the Hindus of the entire village would wear green and peacock feathers and hold a parikrama (circumambulation) for Ali. Then one day Gupta could not find a page of his noha; he eventually discovered it hidden in his copy of the Gita. “That is also a reality, as is the polarisation,” says Kuckreja .
Over the years, lit fests have proliferated in many cities, pulling in corporate sponsorships and popular authors. The Mahindra Sanatkada Lucknow Festival is dedicated to industrialist Anand Mahindra’s mother, who was from Lucknow. An emotional connect is important for any lit fest, or else it gets reduced to just another event, Kuckreja says, but adds quickly that she is not an event organiser. “I’m a social cultural activist,” she says.

Millstone birthdays,https://www.thehindu.com/society/millstone-birthdays/article31059326.ece,"I crave the old days. And by that I don’t mean when Arnab hadn’t yet said his first words. I mean when you wore fur and bark, lived in a cave, and your mate roasted the giant rodent you’d clubbed to death over a wood fire while you inhaled mellowing herbs.
Because all we lived to those days was 30. If we were lucky. Making it 50 fewer birthday parties to attend per moron-friend.
If the mandatory sangeet and uncoordinated dancing of pot-bellied males wearing sherwanis fashioned out of furnishing material (at every wedding!) is my pet hate, attending the grand birthday bash of same pot-bellied males wearing hakoba shirts with decrepit rear-cleavage playing peek-a-boo from their slim-fat (slam-fit?) trousers is a close second.
Not a month (even one when virus deaths are peaking) goes by without the frantic offspring or hapless wife of some guy celebrating a milestone birthday — Fatuous Forty, Foetid Fifty or Somnolent Sixty — sending you a balloon-and-champagne-spangled invite. 
 And it is always a surprise party! (Why?) And there’s always a dress code: wear black lederhosen and an underwire bra with a fluorescent-green surgical mask (this for the men).
Every guest who has shoehorned himself into a floral Hawaiian shirt for the night is expected to make a moving speech about the birthday boy, as he beams proudly at the bar counter in a purple tuxedo and lime-green cummerbund holding a piece of half-eaten lollipop chicken.
What does one say about a waste-paper merchant (no offence to the profession) who has inherited the business from his father, a moneylender, who in turn took it off a guy who didn’t make three months’ interest? Yes, Birthday Baby has been playing Tambola every evening for 40 years with the same set of friends. And his waist size, much like the universe, has been expanding indefinitely. And he did pass high school, finally, with flying colours... with a little help from the headmaster, his former classmate. But there’s only so much poetry you can bring to these achievements in a speech.
I have found a way out. For now. When my turn to speak comes, I take the mic and pretend to be so overcome by emotion that I’m speechless, at which point my wife (pre-bribed for the task) jumps in and says, “Krishna is too overwhelmed by this, sorry... Too many memories,” and escorts me out for fresh air as the Birthday Boy, overwrought by sentiment, weeps into his whisky glass.
This is a good way to miss what comes next: the mandatory audio-visual mini biopic of the guy’s life. How much action, sentiment, suspense and drama can even James Cameron bring to a montage of half-a-century’s worth of photographs of a man whose nickname is thoongu moonji? Even with ‘The Final Countdown’ and ‘Eye of the Tiger’ as background score?
But the last one turned out a bit different. As I stood outside waiting for the son to finish his hip-hop-style rendition of ‘Ammavum Neeye Appavum Neeye’, I saw that I had a surprise companion: Birthday Boy’s wife of 31 years.
“Listen,” she said. “Our place, Saturday, okay?”
“Wait, today is Thursday,” I looked at my watch. “Actually, Friday, it is past 12. So you mean tomorrow?”
“Yes,” she said. “It’ll be an intimate gathering. Just 10 couples.”
“What’s the occasion?” I gulped.
“Watching the three-and-a-half-hour video... with background music, SFX ... and director’s (meaning, moi) commentary of this event, silly,” she said. “Wear black. It is going to be a riot!”

‘Flight services plunged on COVID-19’,https://www.thehindu.com/business/flight-services-plunged-on-covid-19/article31063546.ece," A top level executive of Boeing on Friday said there has been a steep reduction in flight operations by airlines in the Asia Pacific region following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This is pattern that is likely to be seen in the Europe and the U.S. under the impact of COVID-19, Darren Hulst, vice-president, commercial marketing, The Boeing Company, said here. 
 He, however, was hopeful of the COVID-19 impact on the aviation industry withering away towards the end of the year.
Mr. Hulst, during a media interaction at Wings India 2020, said there had been a 50% reduction in daily flights in the Asia Pacific region. “In mainland China market in normal times, there are 15,000 departures a day and at the peak of the virus, they were operating 3,000 flights a day,” he said.
“If you exclude China, rest of Asia Pacific, probably, 5,000 flights are operated a day. At one point, we saw 2,500,” he said, pointing out that these were rough estimates. As the virus spreads to other markets, “we see airlines in Europe and the U.S. taking action in terms of cutting capacity. It is demand driven and policy driven,” he said.
Speaking on the Boeing operations in India, Salil Gupte, president, Boeing India, said the company spent $1 billion every year in India on sourcing components from 200 suppliers. The goal is to grow that to $2 billion a year, he said. Manufacturing, he added, was a big part of the work Boeing did in India with small and big manufacturers.
 A release said the suppliers manufacture high-end systems and components for some of Boeing’s most advanced products as part of its global supply chain. These include critical components such as aerostructures, wire harness, composites, forgings, avionics mission systems and ground support equipment.
The partnership between India and Boeing had grown over the last 75 plus years, with 3,500 people in India and more than 7,000 people working with its over 200 supply chain partners.Boeing forecasts India to be the third largest global market for commercial fleet. The “aviation market is resilient and the market will grow throughout 2020. Boeing forecasts air carriers in India will need over 2,500 new commercial aircraft by 2040,” the release said. ",business
Auto wholesales plunge in Feb.,https://www.thehindu.com/business/auto-wholesales-plunge-in-feb/article31063523.ece,"Wholesale vehicle sales in the country declined by a little more than 19% in February 2020, as consumer sentiment remained subdued amid economic slowdown and upcoming transition to BS-VI norms, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Friday.
“The automobile industry continues to face hardships due to a steeper decline in production and wholesale dispatches in all segments in February 2020,” said Rajesh Menon, director general, SIAM.
Vehicle sales across categories stood at more than 16.46 lakh units in February 2020 versus more than 20.34 lakh units in February 2019, according to SIAM data. Rajan Wadhera, president, SIAM, added, “The decline in wholesale dispatches is primarily due to the economic slowdown and lower production of BS-IV vehicles.” He also warned that supply chain disruptions from China was additional cause for concern and may hit production plans of companies, going forward.
Domestic sales of passenger vehicles ( including cars, vans and utility vehicles) dropped 7.61% in the last month to over 2.51 lakh units from more than 2.72 lakh units. The data showed that car sales were down 8.77% to about 1.56 lakh units while that of vans was lower by 32.76% at 11,880 units. However, sales of utility vehicles were almost flat at 83,351 units.
Total two-wheeler sales in February fell by 19.82% to more than 12.94 lakh units compared with over 16.14 lakh units in the same month last year. While motorcycle sales tumbled 22% to 8.16 lakh units, scooter sales dipped 14.27% to 4.22 lakh units. Sales of commercial vehicles were down by almost 33% to 58,670 units against 87,436 units sold in the same month last year. 
Companies dispatched 35,245 units of light commercial vehicles, down 28%, and 20,425 units of medium and heavy commercial vehicles, a fall of over 40%.
On Thursday, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) had said that the retail sales — as measured by vehicle registration numbers — grew 2.60% to over 17.11 lakh units in February 2020. While sales of passenger vehicles declined by 1.17% to over 2.26 lakh units, that of two-wheelers and commercial vehicles were up 1.52% to 12.85 lakh units and 13% to 92,805 units, respectively.
Mr. Wadhera said some upside on the registration numbers can be attributed to last minute purchase by customers trying to advance purchase of BS IV vehicles.",business
Rupee rebounds after RBI intervenes,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rupee-rebounds-after-rbi-intervenes/article31063521.ece,"The rupee made a sharp recovery after touching a record low of 74.50 a dollar in early trade following intervention and assurance of liquidity by the Reserve Bank of India.
The rupee opened weak at 74.39 a dollar compared with the previous close of 74.24 and then touched the day’s low of 74.50. The previous record low was on October 9, 2018 when the rupee closed the day at 74.39 a dollar.
On Friday, the rupee closed the day at 73.80 a dollar, up 44 paisa from its previous close.
The turbulence in the financial market steered the central bank into making a statement, saying it would take steps to ensure adequate liquidity and that the situation was being monitored closely.
Markets around the globe are facing volatility due to risk aversion; investors are holding liquidity even as COVID-19 keeps spreading. Trading was halted in the domestic equities market after hitting their lower circuits on Friday.
“The Reserve Bank of India is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and will take all necessary measures to ensure that money, debt and forex markets remain adequately liquid and stable, and continue to function normally,” the RBI said.
On Thursday, the RBI announced that it would open a six-month dollar sell-buy swap window to pump in liquidity in the foreign exchange market. The central bank will conduct U.S. dollar-rupee sell-buy swaps worth $2 billion on March 16, to ‘begin with,’ in its effort to fight market volatility. 
The central bank observed mismatches in the U.S. dollar liquidity had become accentuated across the world but added that the level of foreign exchange reserves remained at comfortable levels to meet any exigency.

Four private lenders join Yes Bank rescue ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/four-private-lenders-join-yes-bank-rescue/article31063513.ece,"Private sector lenders, including ICICI Bank and HDFC, will pick up stake in the troubled private sector lender Yes Bank.
While ICICI Bank and HDFC said they would invest ₹1,000 crore each in Yes Bank for about 5% stake each, Axis Bank pegged its investment at ₹600 crore and Kotak Mahindra Bank at ₹500 crore.
The board of State Bank of India’s (SBI) had cleared an investment of ₹7,250 crore to pick up up to 49% stake in Yes Bank. 
In a notification to the stock exchanges, ICICI Bank said its board had approved an investment of up to ₹1,000 crore, comprising up to 100 crore equity shares at a price of ₹10 per share, under the proposed Scheme of Reconstruction of Yes Bank. 
“This investment is likely to result in ICICI Bank holding in excess of 5% shareholding in Yes Bank, with the final shareholding to be determined based on the final scheme of reconstruction and share issuance,” ICICI Bank said. Similarly, HDFC also announced an investment of ₹1,000 crore for over 5%, while adding that the investment would be completed by March 31, 2020.

Blue-chips gain colour as bourses turn course,https://www.thehindu.com/business/blue-chips-gain-colour-as-bourses-turn-course/article31063502.ece,"While Friday turned out to be the most volatile day for Indian stock markets with the benchmark Sensex trading in a range of nearly 5,400 points and the Nifty hitting the lower circuit of 10% before closing with a gain of nearly 4%, stock- specific action saw many blue-chips gaining over 20% compared to the day’s lows.
Banking majors such as IndusInd Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank were among the top gainers in the BSE 100 index, comprising top 100 companies as per market capitalisation.
While IndusInd Bank gained a little over 46% compared to its day’s low, SBI, PNB and BoB gained between 30% and 39%.
IndusInd Bank touched a low of ₹550.05 before closing at ₹804. Similarly, SBI, which enjoys a high weightage in the Sensex as well, closed at ₹242.25 after touching an intraday low of ₹184.25, a gain of over 31%.
Meanwhile, the Sensex, which had touched a low of 29,388.97 during the morning session, touched a high of 34,769.48 before closing at 34,103.48, up 1,325.34 points or 4.04%. 
The broader Nifty settled at 9,955.20, gaining 365.05 points or 3.81%. Interestingly, the market was abuzz with talks that Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was among the major buyers in the market as most of the banking stocks were currently available at 52-week low levels.
“LIC is a long-term investor and banking is one of the favourite sectors of the State-owned insurance entity,” said a dealer. 
“Most of the stocks are at their multi-year lows and hence, quite attractively priced at the current valuations. For a long term investor like LIC it only makes sense to buy at these levels,” he added.According to provisional data, domestic institutional investors that include banks and insurance companies were net buyers at almost ₹5,900 crore.
Apart from banking majors, stocks like Tata Steel, LIC Housing Finance, BPCL, HPCL and GAIL India also gained between 26% and 29% in intraday trading. 
The intraday reversal in price movement could be further gauged from the fact that all the stocks in the BSE 100 index, which were significantly down during the morning session, ended with gains as the session came to an end.",business

In fact, minutes after start of the trading session, the Nifty’s plunge to a low of 8,555.15 led to suspension of trading in both exchanges for 45 minutes.
Sector heavyweights and bluechips such as TCS and State Bank of India were all trading more than 10% lower as the markets hit their lower circuit for the first time in 12 years. The resumption of trading, however, saw buying support for stocks, most of which are currently trading at their 52-week lows on account of growing concerns over the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Incidentally, the India VIX index, which had more than doubled in the recent past, surged by another 25% on Friday. The recovery in the markets was primarily led by strong buying by domestic institutional investors led by LIC as the net buying by such entities was pegged at almost ₹5,900 crore on Friday as per BSE data.
 Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued selling shares in huge numbers with the day’s off-loading totalling ₹6,027.58 crore. On Thursday, they were net sellers at almost ₹3,500 crore.

Measures are taken to deploy technology solutions and online collaboration tools for business interactions, client meetings and internal workouts, so that travel is reduced to the maximum. Companies are also enhancing workplace sanitation and effective monitoring of food provided to employees.
“Employees who are even slightly unwell or unable to work or are showing any suspected symptoms, are advised to take all necessary caution with regular medical check-ups.

Home Minister Amit Shah-led ministerial panel on Air India decided on extending the deadline for submission of expression of interest (EoI) by interested bidders till April 30.
While extending the date, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) in a notification said the changes are in view of the requests received from the IBs (interested bidders) and the prevailing situation arising out of COVID-19.
In January, the government restarted the divestment process of Air India and invited bids for selling 100% of its equity in the state-owned airline, including Air India’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.

Interested bidders for Air India should have a net worth of ₹3,500 crore.
After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government this time has decided to offload its entire stake. In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76% stake in the airline.

‘Bloodshot’ movie review: Bloody and senseless,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bloodshot-movie-review-bloody-and-senseless/article31061683.ece,"There’s never a dearth of superhero films with Hollywood and comic books continue to enjoy their day in the sun with Bloodshot. The Valiant Comics title comes alive on the big screen with action star Vin Diesel. As far as powers go, Ray Garrison (Diesel) has got regenerative abilities coupled with super strength. The former soldier, formidable in his heyday as it were, is now transformed into a mean unstoppable killing machine. Engineered by Dr Emil Harting (Guy Pearce ) of Rising Spirit Technologies, Bloodshot is injected with nanites, millions of little machines that will repair any physical degradation within seconds. The nanites are not in his blood but have become his blood.
BloodshotDirector: David S.F. WilsonCast: Vin Diesel, Eiza González, Sam Heughan, Toby Kebbell, Guy PearceStoryline: Ray Garrison is resurrected from the dead and augmented with technology but are his powers being used for good?
Equipped to take on the dangerous men who murdered his wife in cold blood, the newly resurrected and amped superhero is on a bloody path of vengeance. And what a fun ride it is for the audience, to watch mindless action unfurl, sometimes in meticulously detailed slo-mo. Bullets are relentless, the body count high and in the middle of it all is a steely eyed Diesel wreaking havoc on those he thinks deserve it. A particularly well-defined boss fight towards the end is testament to the marvels that CGI can accomplish and absolutely worth sitting up straight. The action is quick in overwhelming succession, but it’s the only thing that director David S.F. Wilson can pull off with success. 
Unfortunately, screenplay writers Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer are unable to construct any heft in this action film. With no character arcs to follow and needless twists and turns — Bloodshot’s sob story will most definitely keep all eyes dry, though they might roll back plenty of times — there’s little to do except switch off and watch the fun. But a suspension of all logic is required. Any stabs at self-awareness go awry when clichés are pointed out in futile attempts at humour. New Girl’s Lamorne Morris who plays tech genius Wilfred Wiggins alone elicits real chuckles. Diesel relies on his bulging biceps more than actual skill and other supporting characters remain unmemorable.
As a first in what is clearly intended to be a franchise, Bloodshot will need a lot more than gratuitous action to take Ray Garrison’s adventures forward.",movies
"‘Asuraguru’ movie review: Money, money and money, but nowhere to go",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/asuraguru-movie-review-money-money-and-money-but-nowhere-to-go/article31061078.ece,"We’ve all seen heist films. The ones in which there’s a gang that makes elaborate plans to loot a bank and make off with the money, leading luxurious lives, till someone manages to track them down.
Asuraguru is a thriller-heist film of sorts... the difference is that there’s no gang. There’s no elaborate planning that’s shown. All we know is that Shakti (Vikram Prabhu) is well-skilled in the ‘art’ of executing a crime; in fact, the film begins with an elaborate train sequence ala Thiruda Thiruda that has Shakti looting off a large amount of freshly-printed currency notes.
The art is in quotes for a reason: much into the film, a detective (Mahima Nambiar) even comments on how good this thief is. Shakti doesn’t leave any traces, and he knows his technology.
AsuraguruCast: Vikram Prabhu, Mahima Nambiar, Yogi Babu, JaganDirector: A RaajdheepStoryline: Why does a man keep attempting high-profile robberies?
But what does he do with the money he successfully loots off on three different occasions? That’s the moot question in Asuraguru. While the protagonist’s ‘motive’ is admittedly unique, Asuraguru does not quite explore it to the hilt. Director Raajdheep veers into sub-plots — replete with Yogi Babu’s not-so-funny comedy and Mahima Nambiar’s characterisation — that have weak links with the main plot. There’s also an attempt at a twist of sorts in the end, but it isn’t exactly that will make you jump up and take notice.
Vikram Prabhu’s choice of scripts in his career have been mildly interesting, but Asuraguru’s over-the-top action sequences and tepid flashback sequences do not contribute to that space. As a lady detective solving a case linked to the main case, Mahima Nambiar gets some solid screenspace, but contributes little, save for the scene in which she is exasperated at the protagonist. Comedian Jagan pitches in, but that does not save Asuraguru from its weak cinematic pursuit.",movies
‘Walter’ movie review: Sibiraj’s cop outing is as emotionless as RoboCop,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/walter-movie-review-sibirajs-cop-outing-is-as-emotionless-as-robocop/article31060933.ece,"It’s impossible to make a police story without succumbing to ‘cop’ tropes that have percolated Tamil cinema, traditionally. By now, you must be aware that writing a cop movie is an excuse to propel a hero’s image, milking his masculinity to the point where blood starts spilling out of the screen. That’s not a problem unless there’s some scope for the filmmaker to explore a police officer’s vulnerability. When I say vulnerability, please don’t mistake it for the Killing of a Sacred Character midway through the movie, just so that the hero feels ‘helpless’. These are age-old issues with Tamil cinema’s Cop Universe and have little relevance with Walter.
There has never been a more visibly awkward police officer than Sibi Sathyaraj’s Walter. The awkwardness isn’t restricted to his pursuit in making the character look caricaturish; he stands erect, adjusts his pants every time he walks into the screen, and looks wooden — for the most part, I was heavily distracted by Sibiraj’s bushy moustache which, admittedly, has more layers than the script. These aren’t character traits of Walter, but of an actor who seems like the only person taking efforts to be taken seriously, in a movie that is anything but serious. 
WalterCast: Sibi Sathyaraj, Bava Chelladurai, Natty, Samuthirakani and Shirin KanchwalaDirector: U AnbuStoryline: ASP Walter uncovers the mysterious case of missing babies, orchestrated by a minister
The director’s lacklustre attitude, in the way he perceives cop movies, is evident right through the initial stretches. The central conflict is between two characters: Eswara Moorthi (Bava Chelladurai, in a showy performance), a well-respected political leader, and Bala (Samuthirakani), both belonging to the same party. 
Walter is nowhere in the picture until he’s commissioned by his commanding officer to kill Bala in an encounter. We know the politics behind killing Bala; a) he’s second-in-line to Eswara Moorthi and b) he protected his doctor-friend (Natty) from a culpable offence. But Walter doesn’t ask these questions. He simply executes orders, like a “hunting dog”. That’s how Walter is, in life. Like RoboCop. There’s no emotion, there’s no reaction. Anyway, a vital scene that would alter the lives of Walter and Co, is executed in the most basic fashion — too basic for the film medium and revolutionary for a TV soap.
Are we tracing the life of Walter or Eswara Moorthi, or Bala’s friend, or Eswara Moorth’s son-in-law? We are left scratching our heads — even harder, when an abysmal romantic track takes a full-blown shape. Every movie teaches you something; sometimes about life, sometimes about your existence. Here’s an interesting information I learned from Walter: there’s a rare blood group called Bombay Blood. By the end of the movie, one is bound to say: There will be blood.",movies
Audiences would love to watch Vijay or Ajith sir in a romantic-comedy: Harish Kalyan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/audiences-would-love-to-watch-vijay-or-ajith-sir-in-a-romantic-comedy-harish-kalyan/article31060636.ece,"Harish Kalyan has completed nearly 10 years in the industry, but is known as the man who plays charming, romantic-at-heart characters — whether it is Pyaar Prema Kaadhal or Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum (ISIR). His latest Dharala Prabhu, too, appears to bear testimony to that. 
The actor feels that the Coronovirus outbreak will not have a significant impact on movies in Tamil Nadu. “I watched Kannum Kannum Kolaiyadithaal on a weekday with 60% audience, which is a big deal. I think we’re in a safe zone,” says Harish Kalyan, taking a trip to the washroom nevertheless after welcoming me with a handshake. Excerpts from an interview:
Krishna Marimuthu [the director] and I were discussing another movie. He was developing that script and needed more time. The offer to remake Vicky Donor came from the production side. He asked me if I would be interested, but I was sceptical. He rewrote the script for me, which I liked. We have retained the essence of Vicky Donor and made it our own. Dharala Prabhu will be a new movie. That much I can say.
I’ve seen Vicky Donor and I liked it. My instant reaction was: Is there something called sperm donation? I realised the importance of being a fertile couple in our society. We have changed my characterisation in Dharala Prabhu. We didn’t want to miss out on the core emotion that Vicky Donor tried to convey. But we had to tone down the adult content.
We didn’t feel it was absolutely necessary. Of course, you cannot make a movie like Dharala Prabhu without talking about sperms. But we have conveyed it suggestively. For example, we depict the character’s transformation in song, suggesting that he’s started doing it. Plus, we wanted families to watch our movie. 
I think that’s slowly changing now and the market is opening up. You need to break through the clutter. Who knows...Dharala Prabhu could be a starting point for me. The audience will encourage such movies, if artists are willing to take that risk.
That’s true. I recently watched Sillu Karupatti. It dealt with elderly romance in the most sweetest way. There was another story about a guy suffering from scrotum cancer. Though it wasn’t a star-studded affair, it still got is due, right? But you’re right. Stars should step in for such movies to reach a wider audience. They might also inspire someone like me to reinvent my choice of movies.
Take a movie like American Pie, for instance. It’s not a porn movie but adult comedy. Hindi cinema took years to make something like American Pie. It came much later in Tamil. There’s a clear pattern. I think scenes are changing now. It will take sometime but will definitely happen. Another example is Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal. I’ve been thinking about it for the last two days. It’s a romantic-thriller, but there’s no violence, bloodshed or usage of expletives. And yet, the movie turned out to be a massive hit.
Yes. You cannot opt for bigger stars in this space, given their market space and fanbase. But actors below the A-listers should explore such themes. Speaking of stars, I admire Suriya sir for that. He does a Soorarai Pottru on one hand and does a pakka commercial outing on the other. If you take Bollywood, Ayushmann seems properly stamped for such movies.
That’s where Vivekh sir steps in. I might be the titular hero, but Vivekh sir is the narrative hero. His punchlines are hilarious and never below the belt. For example, there’s a scene where he utters the word sperm and I would chide him for saying it out loud. He would immediately say, “What’s wrong in that, pa? That’s where life beings, no?” Vivekh sir has changed the dimension of the movie.
They finalised Vivekh because nobody could have played that role. Funnily, it’s Vivekh sir’s zone — a comedic character with a liberal dose of message. That’s how his comedies have been. During the shoot, he said something personal about my growth. He said, ‘You’re doing good. I’ve seen Pyaar Prema Kaadhal and rushes of ISIR. You’re moulding well.’ 
I’m at a stage where the audience won’t accept me in a mass movie, thrashing some 20 men. If I have to go back to the 2000s, Vijay sir did a host of romantic movies, displaying multiple shades. But then, he became a huge star. At this point in my career, I’ve the luxury to experiment. 
I myself have asked Simbu sir about the possibility of VTV 2. There comes a phase in everyone’s career where they get saturated. That has become our pattern I guess. I’ve done only few movies, but I myself am thinking of changing my approach to movies. If Harish Kalyan thinks that way, then think about stars.
What’s next?Harish Kalyan will star in the Tamil remake of the Telugu blockbuster Pelli Choopulu. “Lazy, laidback characters have always resonated with audiences. I’m banking on this.” He is joining hands with director Sasi for yet another love story.
Absolutely. Vijay Sethupathi acted in 96. Even today, audience would love to watch a Vijay sir or Ajith sir in a romantic-comedy. But they need to find the right script to make that happen. They cannot act in Pyaar Prema Kaadhal (laughs). Will they be ready to take that risk? I don’t know. But I, as an audience, would like to watch them in this space. Amitabh sir was in his 60s when he made Cheeni Kum.
After ISIR, I had Dhanusu Raasi Neyargale which didn’t do well at the box office. It’s a fact that everybody knows and I won’t lie saying it did decent numbers. The intention was to make a fun outing. Somehow it misfired and I won’t put the blame on one person. But I’ve made it up with Dharala Prabhu.
I can, actually. Sometimes, the script may seem average but might work with the audience. It’s the other way round sometimes. At the end of the day, every experience teaches you something. 
I learnt how miserable it would be, if the execution fails. When I say ‘execution’, it starts from the first look poster. I thought ISIR was a weak script, but Ranjit matched it up with the execution part. He said he was going to shoot the ‘Kannamma’ song inside an elevator. That was a weak set-up for a montage song. But it got a huge reception from the audience.",movies
‘Angrezi Medium’ movie review: Even Irrfan Khan’s presence can’t salvage this protracted drama,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/angrezi-medium-movie-review-even-irrfan-khans-presence-cant-salvage-this-protracted-drama/article31060528.ece,"The most notable thing about Angrezi Medium is the array of interesting actors it has managed to get on board. Most of them, however, are either confined to miniscule roles or fall victims to flat, banal writing, one that they themselves can’t salvage despite their consummate performative skills and screen presence. And to think, that the writing credit is shared by four writers. It’s one too many writers that spoils the plot.
Forget flying, the film doesn’t seem to hold together well on the ground despite an interesting premise. Champal Bansal (Irrfan Khan), a sweetshop owner in Udaipur, wants to help his daughter Tarika (Radhika Madan) realise her dream of going to London for further studies. This could have been an interesting and endearing peep into the relationship between a protective-possessive single father and a daughter who wants to sport wings and take off. It could have also pirouetted on the issues of class dynamics and mobility. Far from it.
Angrezi MediumDirector: Homi AdajaniaCast: Irrfan Khan, Deepak Dobriyal, Radhika Madan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Dimple Kapadia, Ranvir Shorey, Pankaj Tripathi, Kiku Sharda, Zakir Hussain, Tillotama ShomeRun time: 145 minutesStoryline: Champak Bansal, a sweetshop owner from Udaipur wants to send his daughter Tarika off to London for further studies
Instead of any focused progression in the narrative, the film, at best, remains a random collection of disjointed and insanely long sequences and stretched gags. A slapstick but utterly unfunny courtroom battle over the title of a sweet shop, another protracted one of Champak giving speech in broken English at a function in Tarika’s school to bring the spotlight on a corrupt judge. There is more: an outpouring of confessions during a drinking session with brother Gopi (Deepak Dobriyal) and friend (Kiku Sharda), a set piece involving cricket-loving Londoner Babloo (Ranvir Shorey), deportation drama at Heathrow and procuring illegal passport in Dubai from Tony (Pankaj Tripathi). All scenarios that mine broad stereotypes and dish out inane, contrived and infantile humour. 
The improbable twists and turns of the plot would have worked, as they do in a lot of mainstream films, if there was an intrinsic panache and inherent ability to handle the silly. Here everything looks laboured to the hilt. The material and the maker clearly don’t belong to each other. There are other basics missing. The Rajasthani accent of the characters seems to come and go at its own sweet will and leisure. Radhika Madan’s way of talking, that prolonged drawl, gets particularly mannered and grating. One misses the crucial spontaneity between her and Khan in their interplay and face-offs. In fact Khan hits it off better with brother Deepak Dobriyal. Angrezi Medium is the film one had been waiting for, to see Khan back in big screen glory. He gets into the groove effortlessly but the film lets him down.
The lesser characters get in to the film and out of it without any notice. Tillotama Shome was gone before I could take two sips of coffee. Strangely the only moments that worked for me were the ones involving a confrontation between the mother-daughter duo that Champak and his brother bump into in London. Dimple Kapadia and Kareena Kapoor, the lengths of their appearance notwithstanding are the actors who light up the screen for a brief time. It’s criminal to have not etched them and their relationship, well. ",movies
‘Dharala Prabhu’ movie review: Tamil remake of ‘Vicky Donor’ is a squandered opportunity,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dharala-prabhu-movie-review-tamil-remake-of-vicky-donor-is-a-squandered-opportunity/article31060333.ece,"Unless you are in a tearing hurry to remake a popular film from another language, the concept of time allows a filmmaker space for two things.
One, the adapted screenplay could be tighter and crisp (if he/she does not believe in the concept of ‘remaining faithful to the original’). Two, if you have anyway decided to tweak the script to suit ‘cultural sensitivities’ of the audience you are remaking the film for, why not show maturity in your writing and hit two taboos with one stone. Dharala Prabhu fails in both respects.

Audiences would love to watch Vijay or Ajith sir in a romantic-comedy: Harish Kalyan

Eight years ago, when Vicky Donor — a light-hearted take on the hush-hush subject of sperm donation — found its way to theatres, it managed to elevate interest among young Indians eager to figure out what, whom and how they could help. But Dharala Prabhu, despite drawing off Vicky Donor’s core idea, is not a film that could remotely influence anything among a thinking audience, because its director Krishna Marimuthu seems confined, and more confused, with his line of social messaging.
But first things first. What is Tamil cinema’s sudden fascination with the game of football? You’d understand trends like heroes wanting to grow their hair out after Vikram did so in Anniyan. But seriously, why is every hero now wanting to lace a pair of boots and kick a football around? One cannot be too sure if Harish Kalyan underwent some sort of training for his five-a-side pitch theatrics, but judging by the result, it was time he could have instead used to work on his screen presence and to help develop the general range of emotions one expects of an actor these days.
Prabhu Govind (Harish Kalyan), as you have guessed already, is a ‘footballer’ who plays five-a-side games, and aspires to land a job through sports quota from an employment exchange. Dr Kannadasan Meiyappan (an over-the-top Vivekh) is a fertility specialist who promises great many things to his prospective clients, but he needs to find that one healthy donor who could make his tall claims come true. Nidhi Mandanna’s (Tanya Hope) brief from the director seems to be the femme fatale in every exchange, which, if you think about it, is a bit weird when the character has to grieve.
Dharala PrabhuDirector: Krishna MarimuthuCast: Harish Kalyan, Vivekh, Tanya Hope, RS ShivajiStoryline: A fertility specialist convinces a youngster to donate sperms. When he agrees, little does the man realise that his would come back to haunt him
Kannadasan tries all the tricks in the book to coax Prabhu to turn a donor, but he refuses. A situation with his coach, where the latter says that his fragile male ego was the reason why he could not fulfill his wife’s wish to be a parent, is what nudges Prabhu over the edge and he agrees to help Kannadasan. Things are going well, but soon Prabhu falls in love with Nidhi and, eventually, gets married to her. Soon their happily-ever-after is complicated when Nidhi learns she cannot conceive, but one plot twist awaits. Will Prabhu emerge unscathed and manage to keep his family together?
Kannadasan, who seems to be the director’s voice (for all purposes) and the voice of reason as well in the film, is someone who believes in the concept of “children bring families together”. But this viewpoint, I assume, is only valid if said family consists of a heterosexual couple. Eight years on from Vicky Donor, it would have made sense for a Tamil filmmaker to push boundaries and centre this plot on a lesbian couple. That’s an opportunity missed.
Perhaps the biggest flaw in Dharala Prabhu is that the concept of sperm donation is seldom discussed, or does not come across as a major influencer across the story line, except in only the link scenes. Which suggests that the writing could have done with two more levels of refinement. The narrative instead chugs along around the protagonist being a goofy, “likeable”, pseudo-hunk padded up by romantic scenes and songs that are a major drag on the screenplay. Don’t get me wrong, it is not poor film-making; it is just plainly uninspiring.
Dharala... also contradicts itself a lot. Prabhu Govind, earlier on in the film, comes across as someone not too keen on kids because, you know, kids... they are a multitude of problems packaged in a tiny one feet-long blob of a human being. Then, a scene that makes Nidhi fall in love with him has Prabhu argue with a man, who has carelessly let his boy play with waves, where he says, unconvincingly, “Avan avan kuzhandai illama thavichittu irukaan.”
One more example of how a re-imagined plot could have worked better for Dharala... is when the lead male discovers that a child he adopts could actually be his. This moment comes half-way into the second half. Had Krishna Marimuthu wanted a goofball comedy, this could have been the perfect interval block sequence. Another opportunity missed.
I’m of the opinion that a better way of making ideas fit seamlessly across cultures is to treat them as a commonplace occurrence, and not whip up an imagined frenzy around it. Like, if a couple are in a live-in together relationship, do not call attention to the fact in your screenplay, leave it to the audience’s understanding. Like how Dharala Prabhu does not whistle from atop lighthouses about the lead pair’s on-screen smooch. Couples in love do kiss. It really is no big deal, and that is how cultural sensitivites ought to be smoothened.
But this remake squanders its primary objective. The film ought to have sensitised the Tamil audience to the concept of sperm donation. Unfortunately, Krishna Marimuthu manages to take aim, but misses by quite some distance.",movies
J Geetha’s ‘Run Kalyani’ wins an award at International Film Festival of Thrissur,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/run-kalyani-by-j-geetha-wins-an-award/article31060204.ece,"
“Vindicated!” says J Geetha. Run Kalyani, directed by her, has won the Fipresci-India award at the 15th International Film Festival of Thrissur. Shot in the capital city, the woman-centric film is the first feature film of the award-winning documentary filmmaker. Scripted and directed by Geetha herself, the movie premièred at Kolkata in the competition section of the Kolkata International Film Festival when it won a special prize of the jury. 
“For its extraordinary treatment of human psyche in subtle cinematic terms with an aura of brevity, artistic excellence, feministic flavour and reverberating connotations,” read the jury’s remarks about the film. The Fipresci jury included Premendra Mazumdar, Madhu Eravankara and Prem Chand.

Run Kalyani was written many years after Geetha wrote a prize-winning script — A Certain Slant of Light — that won the Goteborg International Film Festival’s development fund in 2008, which was about three sisters set in Kerala in the period between the seventies and the nineties. After the film had to be shelved due to lack of producers, Geetha came up with the story of a young woman, Kalyani, played by Garggi Ananthan, working as a cook in two households in the city. Madhu Neelakandan’s evocative camera follows Kalyani’s routine from day break to night. The movie is about how Kalyani forms different ties with the people in the houses she works in and how two women help each other break shackles that bind them to the mundane. 
Shot with a large cast and with the help of some of the best technicians in the industry, the film was screened in the city by Soorya. Editing was done by B Ajithkumar while Sreevalsan J Menon composed the music for the film.

French director Robin Campillo of ‘BPM (Beats Per Minute)’ fame says AIDS activism shaped his career,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/french-director-robin-campillo-of-bpm-beats-per-minute-fame-says-aids-activism-shaped-his-career/article31059752.ece,"French writer-director Robin Campillo enjoys filming sex scenes. In BPM (Beats Per Minute) — Campillo’s devastating and invigorating 2017 film on the early days of the militant AIDS activist group, ACT UP-Paris — a young newbie, Nathan, and a passionate veteran campaigner, Sean, are in bed, taking off each other’s clothes, after a night of clubbing. As the camera traces their naked bodies, Sean, who is HIV-positive, makes it clear that he prefers to wear a condom. “It’s safer,” he says, as Nathan, who is HIV-negative, obliges. Explicit, queer and unapologetically long, the sex in Campillo’s films often reveals the power dynamics between the characters.
“I really like sex,” the 57-year-old filmmaker says, when we meet on a warm afternoon in Goa. “When my first boyfriend died from AIDS, I was very young and I remember I missed the sex a lot. It was the most difficult thing for me, not to be able to touch him again,” he recalls. 
The AIDS epidemic has shaped Campillo deeply as a filmmaker. In the 80s, after graduating from film school, he had convinced himself that he was HIV-positive. “I thought I was going to die anyway, so it took me ages to make my first film,” he shares. In the early 90s, he decided not to be in denial any more, took an HIV test, found that he was negative, and joined ACT UP as a militant. Known for their rather graphic and urgent campaigns, the group demanded attention with “die-ins,” where members sprawled across public spaces, covered in fake blood, and sometimes even hurled blood on buildings and politicians.

“When I was in ACT-UP, India was trying to make drugs without patenting, which was much needed, and we knew how greedy the pharmaceutical industry was,” recalls Campillo. His time in activism prompted Campillo to make a film about queer people and the AIDS epidemic, but it wasn’t until 2017 that he finally got it out of his head and on to celluloid. 
BPM not only won the Grand Prix (second-most prestigious prize after the Palme d’Or) at Cannes 2017, it also garnered high praise from Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar, the jury president, who broke protocol and said BPM was his personal favourite for the top prize (which eventually went to The Square). After a successful festival run around the world, it went on to win six César awards (French national film awards), including for Best Film, a rare feat for a queer film with explicit sex scenes.
Why sanitise?
Campillo says there are two problems plaguing contemporary queer cinema: they are mostly confined to streaming services and are often sanitised for a straight audience. “I say this to all young filmmakers who are making queer films — you don’t have to apologise for sex scenes or worry about presenting a good image,” he says. In BPM, after Sean’s death, when Nathan has sex with Thibault, another member of ACT UP, “older straight people” called it “cheating”, says Campillo. “But it’s not!” he exclaims. “It’s just casual sex for pleasure, and the fact that I didn’t apologise for it made people accept it more.” 
For him, films like Stranger by the Lake (2013), Ballroom (2003), Carol (2015) and Blue is the Warmest Colour (2013) are unapologetically queer. “But I didn’t like the sex scene in Blue is the Warmest Colour, because one of the two girls is lesbian for years and the other is discovering her sexuality, but when they have sex, it’s like they are equal, they have the same level of knowledge about sex, which is weird for me,” he says.






A still from ‘Eastern Boys’.
 






The awkwardness and power play in lovemaking are what intrigue Campillo. In his controversial sophomore film, Eastern Boys (2014), he explores the relationship between an older French man and a young Ukrainian boy, as they go from being lovers to developing a father-son bond. “I make films, not as a mirror to society, but because I believe in metamorphosis,” he says. “It’s about discovering that we are not the person we thought we were.” The filmmaker is fascinated by how queer characters evolve, beyond their sexuality, and how they transcend labels as they age. “We are getting older, becoming more bourgeois, or losing jobs, and that is changing us more than our sexual desire.”
That’s why intersectionality is so important to Campillo. For him, queer identity is complex and full of contradictions. “The fact that I discovered I was queer as a child is connected to colonialism,” he says. Born in Morocco to French parents, Campillo moved a lot among the former French colonies as a child. His father was in the military, and they shifted to Madagascar when Campillo was 10. The army background that eclipsed his childhood influenced his perception of how men and women were supposed to behave. 
In vogue
Inspired by his childhood in Madagascar, Campillo’s next film, which he hopes to start shooting in July (“My producer wants it to be ready for Cannes”), is currently titled Vazaha. “It means white people, which is often used to refer to foreigners and especially the French,” he explains. “It’s a film that presents the French paradise in Madagascar and then, in the end, you change the point of view and see it through the eyes of the Malagasy.”
Although set in 1972, Campillo wants the costumes in Vazaha to be as contemporary as possible. Even in BPM, which is set in the early 90s, Campillo made his characters wear clothes that are still in vogue. “It’s because I don’t want young people to feel disconnected [from the past],” he reasons. “Today, we have different forms of colonialism, especially in France, where we are dealing with a lot of racism and Islamophobia, so I wanted to talk about the roots of that.” According to the filmmaker, it is easier to be gay, than a Muslim or black, in France. “The government is very right-wing at the moment, so they use queer people for pinkwashing,” he says. 
Campillo refuses to contribute to pinkwashing. After BPM’s success, when he was invited to the Élysée Palace, the official residence of the French President, he declined. “Twenty-five years ago, they thought we were gay fascists, and now they think we are great, which is hypocritical,” he says. No longer an activist, politics for him is now in his films. “Cinema is not militant but it makes people interrogate, puts them in uncomfortable positions and makes them rethink,” he says.

Short film 'Vidiyal': Of sandalwood smugglers in the Periyar Tiger Reserve,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vidiyal-the-story-of-sandalwood-smugglers-in-periyar-tiger-reserve/article31059613.ece,"“Writing the script and directing was a first for me. So was it for the actors who faced the camera,” says Raju Francis, Divisional Forest Officer Vigilance, Ernakulam on his 21 minute short, Vidiyal that was released on February 23, 2020.
His foray into films began when the Head of the Forest Force PK Kesavan, in an outreach initiative, last year, founded a technical team to make films for the Kerala Forest Department YouTube channel that introduces to the public different aspects of the forest. A team of officials was in place but he wished the medium to be more refined — accessible in terms of technicalities and narration.
Francis who nurtured a desire to make films was tasked with this and it proved a way forward.
Vidiyal, meaning sunrise, is a heart warming story of sandal wood smugglers in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) and their rehabilitation in a project called Vidiyal Vana Pathukappu Sangham that provided them a livelihood.
“The story is based on real incidents that took place in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, in 2004, when I was a Ranger,” says Francis adding, “the smugglers were agile and swift. It was difficult to catch them as they knew the terrain well and came across the border from Tamil Nadu. We, with the leadership of the then Deputy Director, Pramod G Krishnan, founded ‘Cheetah’, a team, comprising the cream of our staff and members chosen from the Eco Development Committee to fight this menace.”
A luring narrative, Vidiyal melds a thrilling encounter of foresters and sandal smugglers with the human interest angle of rehabilitating the captured and surrendered criminals. Their new lives as forest guides who take travellers on a tour of their village ends in hope and fulfilment.
The film opens with the camera panning on a child in a paddy field petitioning his mother to tell “the story” once again. The narrative moves forward looping in the action and ends with a moment of truth with the grandfather coming in search of the mother and son.
Knowing and experiencing the story first hand, Francis wrote a script true to the travails in the forest, marrying fact to fiction. Director P Venu, who vetted the script, when Francis approached him, encouraged Francis to go ahead. Cinematographer Uma Shankar completed the shoot in five days in the Lower Camp area of Gudalur and at PTR. Forest officers and reformed sandal smugglers formed the actors. Edited by Renju RV, post production was done at The Collective Studio and the music is by Dawn Vincent.
“My maiden venture was the result partly of my ignorance and partly of my confidence of the subject,” says Francis who is pleased with the reviews the film is garnering. He has many scripts on hand and is looking ahead to make his dream come true — of directing a feature film.",movies
"‘Les Miserables’ movie review: A brutal, yet beautiful critique of class, ethnicity and multiculturalism in France",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/les-miserables-movie-review-a-brutal-yet-beautiful-critique-of-class-ethnicity-and-multiculturalism-in-france/article31059434.ece,"Some films seem to get an added relevance over time and keep acquiring newer meanings in the varied contexts you view them in. Ladj Ly’s debut feature Les Miserables, based on his own short film, is one that has kept evolving over the past year. I added it to my list of the most searing and disturbing films on class wars when I watched it at Cannes. Recently, when viewed in the immediate aftermath of the violence unleashed in Delhi, it felt unwittingly prescient about the flashpoints between the fascist State might and machinery and the marginalised; a situation in which the only outcome is terrible human loss. 
Ly’s film traverses a full circle, from the start to the finish, when it comes to its visual arc and narrative movement. It kicks off with images of joy and togetherness ushered in by a beautiful game of football at the FIFA World Cup. People across all divides unite in the country’s blue jerseys, under the French flag and the fandom of Mbappe. 
As opposed to this cheerful montage, the film ends, quite like Ankur and Fandry, with a sharp, pithy image, a signifier of abject hopelessness and desperation. And a quote from Victor Hugo to put it all in perspective: “There are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.” You reap what you sow, violence begets violence in which often it’s the children who are the victims and their innocence the first casualty.
Between the beginning and the final act is an expose of the deep fissures underlying the unifying passion for sports, an unending chain of hatred that refuses to snap. Do the French ideals of liberty, fraternity and egalitarianism truly hold? In a sideways evocation of Hugo’s timeless classic by the same title, about the humiliation of the dispossessed, Ly powerfully brings to light the contemporary class and colour and religion and race politics. His springboard being the 2005 riots of Paris. Not much has changed in all these years.
Les Miserables (French)Director: Ladj LyStarring: Damien Bonnard, Alexis Manenti, Djebril Zonga, Issa PerciaRun time: 103 minutes
The kinetic, on the move camera mirrors the simmering unrest and discontent as it takes us into the city’s tough suburbs and its battling gangs along with the crime patrol unit of three officers: Stephane (Damien Bonnard), Gwada (Djebril Zonga) and Chris (Alexis Manenti). It’s a world of strifes and fights. On one hand are the deep and long held prejudices of the privileged, and on the other the bottomless anger of the powerless fed by the persistent, everyday harassment and humiliation. Far from getting contained, the resentment only gets stoked and built up and you know that there is no way it can end other than in resistance and rebellion, individual as well as collective.
There is tonal pause in the middle with an extended sequence of the officers going home: a distraught and guilt-ridden Gwada with his elderly mother; Chris, who has no qualms about frisking young girls, with his little daughters and wife seemingly unaffected by the events of the day and Stephane in an empty apartment, still waiting to unpack, calling his his son. It’s time of peace and calm but an uneasy one as you realise soon after.
A terrific ensemble of professional actors, first-timers and non-actors brings alive Ly’s astutely observed characters. They make their presence felt irrespective of the duration of their stay on screen. The rough, raw feel of the film reflects how things are on the edge, can escalate suddenly and run out of hand and how violence is endemic to life on the margins. It can erupt with an unforeseen rage at the any provocation. “What if voicing your anger is the only way to be heard?” asks a character rhetorically. A moment that leaves you badly jolted and speechless. Ladj Ly might be savage in his critique of class, ethnicity and multiculturalism issues specific to France, but his portrayal of the revenge of the oppressed underclass is a warning that societies and States across the world could well heed.",movies
Michael Caine: ‘Nolan’s Batman movies is one of the greatest things I have done in my life’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/michael-caine-enjoys-watching-the-crown-and-is-now-penning-his-first-fiction-novel/article31059162.ece,"In the mid ’60s when Michael Caine crossed the pond to make his first Hollywood film, Gambit, he never imagined that he would spend the next few decades making over a hundred films, win two Oscars, and become a movie star.“I just did not have the looks and I had a very thick cockney accent,” he says during an early afternoon phone call from his London flat.
Ahead of the television screening of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island to mark his 87th birthday tomorrow, the British film icon spoke about the films he is making, the book he is writing, shows he follows on streaming platforms, and on working with director Christopher Nolan. 
Mutual admiration society 
Caine, who will be seen in Tenet this July, has been a part of every single Christopher Nolan film since Batman Begins in 2005. 
The actor vividly remembers the first time he met the auteur. “He came to the front door of my house in the country with a script. I could see him through the glass but I couldn’t recognise him. The moment he introduced himself, I knew exactly who he was because I was a great fan of his three small films,” says Caine.

When Nolan mentioned that he wanted Caine for Batman, the actor was taken aback. “I told him, ‘I am too old for Batman. Do you want me to play the butler? What would my dialogues be? Would you like another beverage or more custard?’” The director then explained that he saw Alfred’s character to be a lot more than just a butler and that he was ‘the foster-father of Batman’. So, I did the movie and it was one of the greatest things I have done in my life.” It is an industry joke that Nolan thinks of Caine as a ‘lucky mascot’. The actor confirms this, saying, “All the films I have made with him have raked in over a billion dollars, so he has to have me in a film even if he has no part for me. In Dunkirk, I was only a voice-over and I got billing in the credit title.” 
It is no surprise then that he is in Tenet (‘I don’t know what it means’), also starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia and Kenneth Branagh. “He [Nolan] is so secretive he won’t let me have the script. All I had was one day’s work and he gave me my pages. I did my part and shot only with John David. I haven’t heard anything since.”
The storyteller 
While Caine often talks about how ‘there aren’t too many parts for 87-year-old men in the movies’, he has two other releases apart from Tenet this year. “There’s a modern version of Oliver Twist called Twist. It is very grown up and Rita Ora plays the Artful Dodger. Before Christmas, I did Best Sellers, a comedy movie in Montreal about an alcoholic author who has to go out and publicise his book.” The two slotted for 2021 are historical action drama Medieval and Four Kids and It (based on the eponymous 2012 novel by Jacqueline Wilson).
When he is not making films, the Alfie actor enjoys watching them. But not in theatres. “I wait for them to come on TV,” says Caine, who sent Twitter into a mini-meltdown in January when he tweeted about the Sam Mendes film, 1917. “It is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. It is very human. I would know a good war movie because I was a soldier in the Korean War,” he says. 
A fan of OTT platforms, Caine has watched all the Jack Ryan adventures on Amazon and is currently watching The Crown. “I thought I knew everything about the British royalty, and every single episode (he has watched four now) has me sitting there with my mouth open, amazed about all these things I did not know. It is quite extraordinary.”

In verse
Off screen too, Caine is a raconteur extraordinaire. Over the years, he’s written multiple biographies; the last one was called Blowing the Bloody Doors Off. 
He is now busy with his first attempts at fiction with a thriller, If You Don’t Want To Die. “I cannot write any more biographical books because I am 87,” he laughs, adding, “I do not read posh, intellectual fiction; I only read thrillers. I am having fun writing it, but I do not know whether anyone will have a great deal of fun reading it.”

The director first revealed that his script for Thupparivaalan 2 revolved around (possibly the robbery of) the Kohinoor diamond, and that he had conceptualised the movie to help Vishal with his debts, and even found a producer for the same.
“But Vishal wanted to produce it under his banner, even though it was an expensive project. I told him I’d write a different script that he could produce under 10 crores, and after his financial situation was stable, he could take on Thupparivaalan 3. But he was adamant.”
Mysskin then dismissed several claims that Vishal had made in his earlier posts against him, notably about Mysskin’s salary and the money he spent on filming. The filmmaker requested the media to ask for any proof for Vishal’s allegations before believing him.






Mysskin, Vishal and Ilaiyaraaja before the start of ‘Thupparivaalan 2’
 






 
“I considered him my brother. So when the conflict arose, because he refused to pay me the salary I was asking for, (Vishal wanted Mysskin to direct Thupparivaalan 2 for the same amount he had directed the original 2017 movie for), I decided to walk away from the project,” the filmmaker explained.
That’s when things got ugly. Mysskin states that not only did Vishal abuse him, but, “when my brother questioned him, he hit him! Vishal had the nerve to even refer to my mother with explicit words. I cannot believe I stood by him when nobody else did, and even supported him during the whole Nadigar Sangam campaign.”
Mysskin added that he completed 32 days of shooting, and was forced to give a NOC (no objection certificate) to Vishal to allow the production of the movie.
He added that he would expose the Action star’s true colours soon: “I’d told Vishal that he would face troubles because of his friends Ramana and Nanda, and now that has exactly happened! Vishal is a porukki (scoundrel). He’s a producer’s son and thinks he can get away with anything. I, however, am the son of a tailor, and came to this industry with just a blank paper and a pen. Can’t I do it all over again? My legacy of work will hold me in good stead.”
Mysskin concluded his speech, saying, “I must protect Tamil Nadu from him. Vishal, your troubles begin now, and you will not be able to sleep hereafter. Let’s go to war.”",movies
Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are taking it ‘one day at a time’ after coronavirus diagnosis ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tom-hanks-and-rita-wilson-are-taking-it-one-day-at-a-time-after-coronavirus-diagnosis/article31058660.ece," Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson on Friday gave a health update from coronavirus quarantine, saying they are taking it “one day at a time“.
The couple, who is in isolation at a hospital in the state of Queensland in Australia, said they are being well cared for.
“Hello folks. @ritawilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us. We have COVID-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one-day-at-a-time.There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no? Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball,” Hanks posted on his social media accounts.
 The post was accompanied by a photograph that showed the couple smiling.
Hanks announced on Thursday that he and his wife have been tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
 The actor couple, who is currently in Australia to shoot for the pre-production of Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley film, decided to get tested after they felt “a bit tired”. 
The deadly virus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,200 lives and infected more than 117,330 people across 107 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation on Wednesday describing the outbreak a pandemic. ",movies
Coronavirus | Delhi cinema closure rattles Bollywood ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/delhi-cinema-closure-rattles-bollywood/article31054448.ece,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s decision to shut down cinema halls in the Capital till March 31 brought home the enormity of the COVID-19 impact on Bollywood with the release of one of the major films of this year, Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi, deferred from its March 24 release, to an unspecified date. 
Rohena Gera’s Sir, supposed to release next Friday, was also postponed to an indefinite date, while Yashraj Films have said it is yet to take a decision on Dibakar Banerjee’s Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar slated for March 20 release.
The Delhi CM’s decision was the last straw for the makers, who had been dithering on whether to release Sooryavanshi or not. A statement from Rohit Shetty Picturez said the postponement is “keeping in mind the health and safety of our beloved audience”. 
According to Delhi exhibitor Sanjay Mehta, on an average, the Delhi-U.P. territory accounts for 22% of the revenue of Hindi films, with Delhi alone accounting for about 10 to 12% of the collections. Shailesh Kapoor, CEO of media consulting firm Ormax Media, put the figure between 10-15%. “Delhi’s is a sizeable share, can go up to 20% for a metro-centric film,” he said.
Mr. Mehta estimated that within the Delhi-U.P. territory, Delhi, with its multiplexes, brings in more for the so-called family or gentry films like the one releasing this Friday — Homi Adjania’s Angrezi Medium. “Delhi brings 60-65% collections for gentry films within the Delhi-UP territory and for mass films it could be 50-50 or 40-60 between Delhi and U.P.,” he said.
However, he said it will be difficult for Angrezi Medium to back out now at the last minute with overseas delivery, and that across the country, already locked. “They could have had second thoughts if the CM decision had come on Monday,” Mr. Mehta said.
Mr. Kapoor said the Delhi theatre closure decision was a major setback for the Hindi film industry, with every likelihood of it having a domino effect. “Other States may follow. The decision adds to the overall sense that it is not safe to venture out to watch a film,” he said.
A continuing Ormax study on the impact of COVID-19 on theatre-going behaviour showed 26% regular theatre-goers in India are likely to stay away from theatres till the threat of the infection is reduced. The survey was conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu industries belt between March 9 and 11. This was an increase from the 23% in the earlier poll conducted between March 6 and 8.
The spike was sharper in south India, with 21% saying they will stay away as opposed to 17% last week. In the Hindi belt, too, the figure had risen from 26% to 28%. The next round of results, out on Monday, might see a bigger leap now after the Delhi cinema closure.
Right now, the overall state hangs between caution, fear and panic — not entirely conducive for a moviegoing experience. “Watching movies is not something essential; it is a thing for relaxation,” said Mr. Kapoor, about why people would be keeping away from theatres volitionally. He said it would take time for people to come back to theatres even after they reopen in Delhi. 
 He had earlier cited to The Hindu the case of the film Main Khiladi Tu Anari, distributed by him back in 1994. “It started off at 100% collection. On the 6th day, the Delhi government ordered cinema closure due to a plague scare. The film couldn’t gather the same momentum when the theatres reopened.”
 So not just Sooryavanshi, but the fate of many other films, including 83 and Coolie No. 1, hangs in the balance. For their makers, it is a wait and watch game, even as the industry stays in suspended animation. ",movies

"Retail inflation eases to 6.58%, industrial production quickens ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/retail-inflation-eases-to-658-industrial-production-quickens/article31052799.ece," Retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index slowed to 6.58% in February, while the industrial production growth as measured in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) quickened to 2% in January amid subdued performance by the manufacturing sector, official data released on Thursday showed.
Retail inflation, which was 7.59% in January 2020 and 2.57% in February 2019, slowed mainly due to easing food prices. Inflation in the food basket was 10.81% February 2020, lower from 13.63% in the previous month, as per data from Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
The government has mandated the central bank to keep inflation at 4% with a margin of two percentage points on on either side.
“The moderation in inflation has expectedly been led largely by food inflation while core inflation remains muted amid tepid demand,” Upasna Bhardwaj, Economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank said. “We expect the inflation trajectory to continue to moderate going ahead led by deflationary trends from falling crude oil prices, lower food prices and weak demand.” 
She added that with domestic and global growth expected to face downside risks from the spread of COVID-19 and deflationary forces emerging, “we see room for up to 50 bps of rate cut by the MPC, with any further easing contingent on the evolving growth environment.”
The IIP had accelerated 1.6% in January 2019. For January 2020, official data showed that the mining sector output grew 4.4% against a rise of 3.8%, manufacturing output rose 1.5% compared with 1.3% in the year-ago month, and electricity generation rose 3.1% versus 0.9% in January 2019.

 Error-prone Sindhu falls to Okuhara,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/error-prone-sindhu-falls-to-okuhara/article31064081.ece,"World champion P.V. Sindhu was on Friday ousted from the All England Championship after being outlasted by a determined Nozomi Okuhara of Japan who rallied her way to a thrilling three-game win in the quarterfinals.
The 24-year-old Indian squandered a sparkling start as Okuhara produced a rearguard action to overcome Sindhu 12-21, 21-15, 21-13 in a 68-minute last-eight encounter at the Arena Birmingham. Sindhu’s defeat ended India’s campaign at the Super 1000 tournament. 
Sindhu had come into the match with a 9-7 head-to-head record against Okuhara, having demolished the Japanese in the finals of the 2019 World Championships.
The Indian began the contest with the same intensity, quickly moving to a 3-0 lead and swelling the advantage to 7-2 with a precise shot at the backline.
The Japanese narrowed the gap to 5-8 before Sindhu unleashed a shot at the back and grabbed another point when Okuhara found the net.
Sindhu entered the break with a five-point cushion. The Indian continued to dominate the proceedings after the breather, putting her opponent under pressure and gathering points at will. 
Okuhara won a few points with her straight and cross-court smashes, but those were too few as Sindhu zoomed to 18-9.
With Okuhara’s weak returns going to the net, Sindhu had a massive 20-11 advantage. The Indian quickly sealed the opening game when Okuhara erred again.
After the change of sides, Okuhara showed more intent, employing a low service and tried to put Sindhu on the back foot. It worked as she took a 5-2 lead. The Japanese engaged Sindhu in fierce rallies and forced her to make errors to lead 7-3.
A couple of unforced errors from Okuhara helped Sindhu to narrow the gap. A cross-court shot and return of serve helped Sindhu keep it to 8-10 before Okuhara entered the mid-game interval with a three-point lead.
Okuhara didn’t let the momentum slip after the break as Sindhu failed to keep pace in the rallies. The result was that the Japanese jumped to a 16-9 lead in no time.
With Sindhu going long twice, Okuhara led 18-10 and soon roared back into the contest when the Indian found the net after saving three game points.
In the decider, Okuhara continued to dictate the pace of the rallies, leading 5-2 early on. The Japanese didn’t allow Sindhu to attack, reducing the Indian to playing the retrieving game.
A stunning return to Sindhu’s forehand gave Okuhara an 8-3 lead. The lightning-quick Okuhara left Sindhu frustrated with her speed and placement as she grabbed an 11-5 advantage at the interval.
Errors continued to pile up for the Indian as Okuhara pulled away to a 16-7 lead. Sindhu missed the lines and found the net too often, allowing Okuhara to move to 19-11. The Japanese sealed the match when Sindhu committed another error.

How to clean the bundle of germs that is on your phone ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-to-clean-the-bundle-of-germs-that-is-on-your-phone/article31068274.ece,"You’re washing your hands countless times a day to try to ward off the coronavirus. 
You should also wash that extension of your hand and breeding ground for germs - your phone. Tests done by scientists show that the virus can live for two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cleaning all “high-touch” surfaces daily, including phones, keyboards and tablet computers. 
But cleaning your phone improperly can damage it. You want to avoid getting moisture inside it or scratching the surface. Don’t spray cleaners directly on the phone, don’t dunk it in cleaning solutions, don’t spray it with compressed-air devices used to clean keyboards and avoid rubbing it with abrasive materials. 
Instead, start by turning off the phone and unplugging all cables. Your phone shouldn’t be charging as you clean. 
You can use Clorox wipes or wipes with 70% alcohol, which you can get at the drugstore, to wipe down your phone. Apple, which has cautioned against using household cleaners on its phones, says to do that “gently.” AT&T has further recommended wringing out disinfectant wipes before using them on a phone. 
You can also use soft cloths to clean the phone, like a microfiber cleaning cloth or the cloths used to clean camera lenses or your glasses. Google says you can dip the cloth in soap and water, as long as you’re careful not to get moisture in the phone. AT&T says paper towels work, too. You can spray them with disinfectant. Again, don’t spray the phone itself. 
Samsung, the world’s biggest phone manufacturer, says it’s offering a free phone-sanitizing service involving UV light inside U.S. Samsung stores and service centers. It will expand to other countries in the next few weeks. 
The phone-cleaning step is one of many measures public-health authorities are recommending to try to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected 137,000 people worldwide. More than 5,000 have died. Most patients have only mild or moderate symptoms, but the elderly and people with existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. ",technology
Neha Dhupia defends her opinion on ‘MTV Roadies Revolution’: ‘I’ve been misinterpreted’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/neha-dhupia-defends-her-opinion-on-mtv-roadies-revolution-ive-been-misinterpreted/article31069339.ece,"After being heavily trolled for her comment that seemed like she was defending a girl for cheating in a relationship on the show MTV Roadies Revolution, actress Neha Dhupia on Saturday took to social media to defend herself. She posted a lengthy statement, declaring she has been misinterpreted.
The controversy started after a recent episode of the ongoing season of the show, wherein Neha, who is a gang leader, reprimanded a male contestant for slapping a girl, for allegedly cheating on him with five other boys. She also defended the girl saying as far as cheating goes, “it’s her choice”.
Neha’s attitude, however, did not find favour with netizens, with many users alleging she was a “fake feminist”.
Responding to the trolls, Neha wrote: “Roadies is a show that I have been a part of for five years and enjoyed every bit of it. It takes me all over India and gives me the opportunity to team up with absolute rock stars from all parts of the country. What I do not like or accept is what is happening for more than two weeks now! Recently during one of the episodes that aired, I took a stand against violence.""
She went on, “A guy talked about his partner who cheated on him (allegedly) and in retaliation, he hit her by his own admission. What the girl did is a choice she made which is a moral choice regardless of someone, man or woman... adultery is a moral choice. Cheating is not something I stand for, and it is unfortunate that I have been misrepresented for the same... but what I do stand for is women’s safety.”
She also stated how trolls have affected her family members.
“Sadly, as a reaction to my opinion, I have been subjected to weeks of vitriol. One of my posts had over 56k comments! Yet I was silent but now people close to me who have nothing to do with this — my family, my friends, my co-workers and even my dad’s personal WhatsApp are being flooded with abuses and harassment. My daughter’s page is nothing less than a barrage of abuses and this is not acceptable to me,” Neha added.
“What a man or a woman does in a relationship is their choice and moral choices are always ambiguous. But no matter what they are, they cannot lead to physical abuse. I stand by the fact that NO MATTER WHAT ... physical abuse or assault is not acceptable. Obviously, a man’s physical strength is a lot more than a girl's, and gender-based violence against women is a huge problem in our country and across the world... I urge people, whether a man or woman, to educate themselves about domestic violence... If you’re a victim of abuse, please stand up for yourself. You are not alone,” she concluded.",entertainment
The smells of foreign,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-smells-of-foreign/article31060426.ece,"Those were smells we used to call foreign smells. The suitcase wheeled in from the airport late at night held a treasure of these smells. From chocolates and shower gels. From ziplock bags of deodorants and face creams. From the smell of clothes washed and tumble-dried in washing machines. 
While Hamam soap and Sunsilk shampoo were the usual smells in our homes, and the clothes dried on our terrace smelt of the sun, these new smells filled our heads with a new and exotic excitement. The cousins from America had arrived.
They slept till late, they spoke with a twang. They ate chips from colourful plastic bags. They brought cans of soup and other processed food and guarded this stash fiercely. The one-month visit was discussed at length before they arrived, menus carefully planned. 
But the cousins always seemed to yearn for the stuff hidden in their suitcases. Their mothers looked like ours, except for the accent on some particular words. They giggled with your mother and aunts and made jokes about the old times in the kitchen. They ate with their hands like you. And when it was time to go back to the U.S., they always cried the most. The children never did. The children were the ones we had to contend with. They introduced the word ‘space’ to us. Knock before you enter, don’t run into your own room if they are there. They might need ‘space’.
The foreign smells lingered all month.
The cousins played with you. Though your idea of playing was hanging out on the terrace shooting the breeze or reading an Amar Chitra Katha or Tinkle, theirs involved video games and fancy magazines. And they always seemed to get bored quite easily. A feeling you didn’t know back then. They dressed differently from you. The girls had colour preferences: they dressed in mauve one year, there was a denim phase another year, miniskirts the next. The clothes you wore were normally fashion choices made by your mother. Your hair was in two braids or one, this was the extent of hair styling. But the cousins had more choices with everything. They brought their music in a Walkman and what you heard from their headphones probably shaped your musical sensibility for a while. 
The cousins from America filled you with pride one day and a total sense of inadequacy the next. But you were always polite. You took the bars of chocolate, the Hubba Bubba, the ziplock bag of assorted candy that had your name scrawled on it with a marker, which you rationed and ate carefully so they lasted longer.

The years passed and the city changed a little like you. The cousins came back as teenagers, you were older, bolder. Your fashion sense had evolved and Indo-western was your thing. They admired your long hair and Indigo kurtas paired with jeans. The Marina beach had more than peanuts and thenga-manga-pattani-sundal to offer. Dollops ice cream and Coca-Cola had made an entry. You drove them to Mahabalipuram now that you could drive. Now we could talk about boys. They had gone further bases than you but there was much to talk about and giggle. The foreign experiences now mixed with the foreign smells.
Then a time came during college when America started calling everyone everywhere. Everyone you knew was clambering to write the SATs and TOEFLs. Learning long and tough English words and colouring in choices. Young adults waited eagerly for the postman. Some families bade goodbye to a son or a daughter, some to a boyfriend, girlfriend or a best friend. Tearful goodbyes took place at airports where we looked on as they ventured out into the unfamiliar world of those very same foreign smells of our childhood. 
The best friend or boyfriend would soon become a voice on the telephone, the words arriving a little delayed, too early in the day for romance, too hurried to say anything meaningful, no time for pauses. The relationships seldom survived the distance. 
A letter may sometimes arrive many weeks later with all the words that couldn’t be spoken on the telephone. The languid summers usually lulled the pain. And life went on.
Love to hate
American mappilais (sons-in-law) made an entry after college. He was everything a girl was supposed to have dreamt of. We lost a few friends to those. The migration taking with it memory. They returned after a few years carrying a lot of prejudices. They shopped at dollar stores for their Indian relatives: in their defence, there were many relatives and big expectations. The same person who shared all your joys and pains came back a little changed, a touch of envy in their voice that you have house help to clean and cook. The nostalgia that made them love the city and hate it. Perhaps they needed to love it to keep coming back and to hate it and judge it so they could be happy where they lived. 
Brand is here
Now we are swamped with malls. Every foreign brand has a store here. There are sales everywhere, a word I had only heard from the cousins before, always mentioned with a light in their eyes. 
Today we are covered in brands from head to toe. Our children have access to every possible chocolate and candy from every part of the world. There’s a McDonald’s in every corner and a Starbucks serving an extra-large take-away cup of coffee, the kind they carry around on Wall Street I think. 
Now, it’s our children who are bored easily and who want space. They struggle to speak in their mother tongues. They remind us of our cousins from America. We, on the other hand, have come full circle from loving the foreign smells to loving familiar smells. Hamam soap and filter coffee, jasmine and fresh coriander and rain on earth. We try to get the children to love them too. Patiently. 
The cousins don’t come around so often any more. Work, children, school, commitments. Facebook keeps us connected. But when they do return, their suitcases are still filled with goodies for everyone. But the foreign smells have gone.

Another Louie lament,https://www.thehindu.com/society/another-louie-lament/article31060024.ece,"Somebody spiked the punch at the club’s Saturday night duplicate and the players were bidding a little wildly. Hard Luck Louie was feeling his oats when he bid to slam, but the contract had decent play. 
The opening heart lead went to dummy’s queen, East’s king, and Louie’s ace. Louie ran the queen of spades at trick two and was quickly down one. East won with his king and returned a heart. “Both kings offside,” said Louie. “Darn my luck!”
Lucky Larry was also feeling the joys, and he arrived in the same contract with the same opening lead. He also covered with dummy’s queen and captured East’s king with the ace. He led the queen of spades, just like Louie had done, but when West followed low, Larry rose with dummy’s ace. He cashed the ace and king of diamonds and was a bit surprised when West showed out but didn’t ruff. Larry ruffed a diamond, cashed the ace of clubs, and ruffed a club in dummy. Another diamond ruff, another club ruff, and Larry discarded his losing heart on one of dummy’s established diamonds — making six!
Larry’s line of play was far superior to Louie’s. The king of spades might have fallen under the ace, or the diamonds might have split 3-2 with the king of spades in the hand with three diamonds. There are other layouts, in addition to this one, where Larry’s line would have also worked.",society
Palliative care in Kerala: a success story,https://www.thehindu.com/society/palliative-care-in-kerala-a-success-story/article31059335.ece,"There’s a feeling of ambient purpose and cheerful energy as you walk down the corridors of the Institute of Palliative Medicine, Kozhikode. Nestled in a leafy campus near the chest hospital, the place is bustling with people who have come to lend a hand, or learn how to, at the training classes held regularly at the Institute.
Prakash Mathew, 44, a designer, has for the past four years spent much of his free time helping out at the Institute and at similar initiatives such as Compassionate Kozhikode, training volunteers. 
It’s the interactions with patients and their families that inspire him to keep going — how he can bring a little happiness to their lives; how his words can be of some comfort. 
Each day, at least 500 volunteers like Mathew, most of them students from more than 70 colleges in Kozhikode district, are available to help care for the patients, in addition to some 38 staff members, including doctors and nurses. 
In January, many of them also pitched in to hold a three-day fundraising carnival that featured art, literature, music and food, with handicrafts and dishes made by patients. It was quite a success, with some 30,000 people attending, says P.C. Sreekumar, a volunteer himself, and vice-chairman of the Pain and Palliative Care Society (PPCS), which runs the Institute. 
The volunteers’ work isn’t limited to the Institute; most patients are based at home, and visits — some being night-time home visits as part of emergency services co-ordinated by the city administration — are a major part of the job, made possible by hundreds of volunteer drivers. Some volunteers have personal stories of caring for a friend or relative which motivated them to sign up, but others simply work because they see it as a community initiative.

Inspiring progress
PPCS is an inspiring example of what civil society can do, and it’s far from unique in Kerala, which now has 1,550 palliative care units, 450 of which are run by community-based organisations and NGOs. But Kozhikode is where it all started in 1993, when doctors at the Government Medical College led by M.R. Rajagopal and Suresh Kumar — now Director, WHO Collaborating Centre for Communitry Participation in Palliative care and Long Term Care — founded PPCS. 
Starting out with a focus on cancer — and just ₹1,500 as capital funds — it was recognised by the World Health Organization in 1995 and has expanded its remit over time. But the real turning point, says Dr. Kumar — who was recently in Arunachal Pradesh and Puducherry to help set up similar initiatives and train volunteers — came in 1999-2000 when they started Neighbourhood Networks in Palliative Care, an approach that emphasised local, community-based care rather than an institutional, hospital-based approach led by doctors. 
Over the years, they have trained tens of thousands of volunteers, a number of whom went on to start independent palliative care organisations in their own communities. Their efforts have even extended abroad, working with groups in countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand, with plans to initiate work in Myanmar as well. 
The Government of Kerala has been integrating palliative care with healthcare policy at all levels in a three-tier system. A 2008 policy, updated last year, specifies neighbourhood networks — co-ordinated with NGOs — with trained staff who can identify patients’ needs and provide home care at the primary (panchayat/ municipality/ corporation) level.

The next two tiers are community health centres providing in-patient care, taluk hospitals with staff trained to deal with emergencies; then a division of palliative medicine at all medical colleges and general and district hospitals.
Way forward
 Since 2017, palliative medicine, once an obscure discipline, has been part of the M.B.B.S. curriculum; it has also been offered as an M.D. programme at institutions elsewhere in the country, including AIIMS-Delhi and the Gujarat Cancer Research Institute.
On the other hand, it remains an unglamorous path for doctors and a far-from-lucrative prospect for businesses, with the result that there are only a few small units at private hospitals. While Kerala and, in recent years, other southern States, have made much advance, much remains to be done elsewhere in the country. Just 2% of people who need palliative care in India have access to it, far below the global average of 14%. The figure for Kerala stands above 26%.
What has Kerala done right? Dr. Kumar says, “There’s a difference in the models. In Kerala, there’s so much involvement from the public, from civil society. In States like Tamil Nadu and Telangana, they have services based at a cancer centre or hospital, just as we did when we started out, but there are limitations to that model — not just in terms of numbers, but also quality of care and social support. You can’t keep patients in hospital forever. You can’t treat terminal illnesses or dying stages as an exclusively medical issue. The community-based model, with institutions playing a supporting role, that we are promoting is the only way forward.”",society
 Covid-19 hurts textile exporters,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-hurts-textile-exporters/article31070529.ece,"Textile and clothing exporters have started feeling the impact of Covid-19 because of supply chain disruptions, fall in exports and cancellation of international events.
According to the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil), 11 countries buy 41% of India’s cotton yarn exports and these countries have reported Covid-19 cases. 
Yarn exports are down 30% in value terms in January-February compared with a year earlier. There is a sharp fall in cotton yarn exports to China, Iran, Korea and Vietnam.
Exporters are unable to get appointments from buyers for Market Week 2020 to be held in New York later this month, pointed out Siddhartha Rajagopal, executive director of the council. In the case of home textiles, the biggest markets include France, Germany and the U.S. 
“We need to wait and watch (the market situation in) these countries. China is the largest supplier and India can tap opportunities for specific products,” he said. 
Texprocil has also called off Ind-Texpo 2020, its flagship event which is a reverse buyer-seller meet, to have been held in Coimbatore between March 17 and 19. 
The Apparel Export Promotion Council had asked garment exporters who depend on China largely for their import requirements to explore other sources. 
In a communique to members, the council listed suppliers from Japan for woven fabric made out of artificial filament yarn, slide fasteners and parts, sewing machines, furniture, bases and covers, and sewing machine needles.
“AEPC has made a preliminary study on the possible impact of disruptions of supply of raw materials from China,” said A. Sakthivel, chairman, AEPC.
Similarly, the council has identified products that buyers in the U.S. and Israel are interested in sourcing from India. 
They had been buying these products from China so far. Mr. Sakthivel said Indian exporters should tap such opportunities.",business

‘It’s wrong to presume that mergers will solve banks’ woes’,https://www.thehindu.com/business/its-wrong-to-presume-that-mergers-will-solve-banks-woes/article31070279.ece,"Mergers of nationalised banks will lead to closure of certain branches and doubling or trebling of depositors. It would be a big challenge for the bank with limited staff to serve them as before, says All India Bank Employees Association general secretary C.H. Venkatachalam. Besides, the recovery of NPAs would take a back seat as witnessed in the case of SBI. Excerpts from an interview:
Do you foresee hurdles in the proposed merger of nationalised banks?
The main hurdle will be to the smooth process of integration. In our country, all our banks have their own importance in terms of origin, growth, expansion and geographical [focus], and have been contributing to economic development in their own way. When banks were nationalised in 1969, they were small.
In the last 50 years, all of them have grown in terms of branch network, business volume and customer reach. Merger of banks will take away their identity and customers will find it difficult to deal with the new bank. Secondly, branch rationalisation and branch closures are bound to happen on account of mergers.
Also read|Big bank theory: On Public Sector Bank mergers
What challenges would investors and depositors face?
By merging branches in a certain locality, the number of customers to be taken care of by the merged branch will double or treble. Hence, customer attention and quality of customer service are bound to be affected adversely. When every customer wants better service, the branch will face a big hurdle in this regard.
Borrowers also are used to a particular branch servicing their requirements. They will now be compelled to deal with a new branch. The branch staff too will not be aware of the borrower’s history.
Investors have made their savings in various banks based on preference, convenience, etc. There are customers dealing with such banks for years and for a few generations.
Banking is no simple commercial transaction, but one accompanied by personal experiences and relationship with a particular bank. Now, in the name of mergers, they will be forced to bank with a lender not of their choice.
What would be the status of employee unions as some banks have more than one?
All banks in India are covered by a common and uniform industry-level settlement covering their wages and service conditions. In this regard, the unions will not face any problem, because even after the mergers, employees will continue to have the same wages and service conditions. But, the policies pertaining to transfers and promotions are different in each bank, governed by each bank-level settlement.
Mergers of banks will create a lot of problems for employees in inter-se seniority, transfers to their place of choice, etc. This will pose a challenge to the unions dealing with these problems.
Further, there are many welfare schemes, fringe benefits and other schemes that vary from bank to bank. Mergers will impact these benefits and schemes and unionists have to address these issues to harmonise these benefits.
Further, due to rationalisation and closure of branches, employees may be displaced and deployed to other centres, which will be an important problem to be addressed by the unions.
Will recovery of bad debts take a back seat?
Mergers will totally divert the attention of the banks from loan recovery and it is bound to take a back seat.
The new entity bank will not know the background of the defaulters and borrowers. The volume of borrowal accounts in a branch will rise This is one reason why we are opposing mergers. After merger of six associate banks with SBI, non-performing assets went up. Hence, it is also a wrong presumption that the proposed move [to merge] will resolve problems faced by the banks.",business

So far, the company has invested around ₹600 crore in Oragadam facility and plans to invest around ₹1,500 crore by March 2022, for R&D, acquisitions and others. 
Mr. Choube said initially the company would focus on R&D, manufacturing and supply of sterile and non-sterile formulation products and API across countries. It has one unit in Oragadam and second one was coming up at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu.

Centre to reimburse tax to exporters,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-to-reimburse-tax-to-exporters/article31065130.ece,"The government on Friday approved a scheme for reimbursement of taxes and duties, which were not refunded previously, to exporters with a view to give boost to the country’s dwindling outbound shipments.
 A decision to approve the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here.
 The reimbursement of taxes such as duty on power charges and VAT on fuel in transportation and farm sector captive power generation; mandi tax; stamp duty on export documents; CGST and compensation cess on coal in power production; central excise duty on fuel used in transportation would make Indian products competitive in global markets, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal told reporters.
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in September last year had said this scheme will incentivise exporters at an estimated cost of Rs 50,000 crore to the exchequer.
 These measures are compliant with the WTO (World Trade Organisation) norms. India is a member of WTO, which frames norms for global trade, since 1995.
 Goyal also said sectors and products under RoDTEP scheme will be notified in a phased manner and the MEIS benefits for those sectors and items will be withdrawn. 
This scheme was announced by Sitharaman in her Budget speech on February 1.
 Goyal said with the rolling out of this new scheme, the Merchandise Export Incentive Scheme (MEIS) will be “phased out“.
It is proposed to digitally refund to exporters, duties and taxes levied at the Centre, State and local levels.
 Goyal said duties/taxes/levies not refunded in any other scheme will be refunded under this new scheme, which will be rolled out soon by the Department of Revenue. 
The move assumes significance as a WTO dispute resolution panel has ruled that MEIS was not in compliance with the global trade norms.
 Under the WTO rules, certain duties like state taxes on power, oil, water, and education cess are allowed to be refunded.
 Further, the commerce minister said as India has graduated from the category of the least developed countries, it cannot give subsidies for exports.
 So far, exporters have been getting refund under duty drawback and GST paid on raw materials or intermediates. 
The scheme, he said, will help in providing a level playing field to domestic exporters in the international markets.
 The ministry will hold a detailed consultations with stakeholders concerned for inclusion of products, which would avail refund.
 The Department of Revenue will priorities and soon fix RoDTEP rates for different goods/sector and will notify in a phased manner and accordingly MEIS will be rolled back for those items.
“It will be given to exporters through transferable scrips. All the process will be online to minimise human interface,” he said.
“Stakeholders meeting will be held for fixing the rates. We will take data and see what all cost they bear,” Goyal said adding “We will use the next 6-8 months to talk to the industry, work out the input taxes which do not get refunded“.
A monitoring and auditing mechanism will be put in place. 
The country’s exports contracted for a sixth month in a row by 1.66 per cent in January to $25.97 billion.
 During April-January 2019-20, exports slipped 1.93 per cent to $265.26 billion, while imports declined 8.12 per cent to $398.53 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $133.27 billion. 
 Undet thr scheme, a mechanism would be created for reimbursement of taxes/ duties/ levies, at the central, state and local level, which are currently not being refunded under any other mechanism, but which are incurred in the process of manufacture and distribution of exported products. 
 An official statement said that an inter-ministerial Committee will determine the rates and items for which the reimbursement of taxes and duties would be provided. 
 Transferable duty credit/electronic scrip will be issued as part of refund to the exporters, which will be maintained in an electronic ledger. 
“The refunds under the RoDTEP scheme would be a step towards ‘zero-rating’ of exports, along with refunds such as Drawback and IGST,” it said.
 It added that at present, GST taxes and import/customs duties for inputs required to manufacture exported products are either exempted or refunded. 
 However, certain taxes/duties/levies are outside GST, and are not refunded for exports. 
“The sequence of introduction of the scheme across sectors, prioritization of the sectors to be covered, degree of benefit to be given on various items within the rates set by the Committee will be decided and notified by the Department of Commerce ,” it said.
 The rebate would be claimed as a percentage of the Freight On Board (FOB) value of exports.
 A monitoring and audit mechanism, with an Information Technology based Risk Management System (RMS), would be put in to physically verify the records of the exporters. 
“As and when the rates under the RoDTEP Scheme are announced for a tariff line/ item, the MEIS benefits on such tariff line/item will be discontinued,” it said. ",business

Every story has its own characteristic. [The character] Gypsy is a nomad, so the story also travels like that with him. It is not a story that happens in one place or discusses one subject. The film does speak of contemporary national politics.
There are so many sects, languages and religions, but it is the humanity in the average man that holds us and binds this democracy together. The travel part is essential to discuss these qualities. 
There was criticism that a particular political line of thought was being force-fed.
Look, I’m someone who accepts all kind of feedback my films get wholeheartedly. I don’t speak out against criticism.
I don’t believe in preaching values through an art form. I believe whatever message we try to convey should be wrapped within the aesthetic of the art form. Maybe, the Communist principles and the general politics Gypsy discusses could have made people feel that way... but that should not be the case because this film is based on true events.
Can you elaborate?
You must know of the pictures of Ashok Parmar and Qutubuddin Ansari from the time of [2002] Gujarat riots. We have seen such images from conflict-ridden regions across the world.
A few years ago, I was wondering what happened to those two, and in my research I found out that the Kerala CPI(M) had facilitated a meeting between them. So, when I wanted to make a film on this incident, I wanted to retain the originality. That is why I placed comrades and shifted that part of the story to Kerala.

I did not force fit my thoughts into the screenplay; it was just an attempt to depict a true event to the best possible way on screen.
Prior to the film’s release, you had mentioned that you had to make 50 cuts to Gypsy due to CBFC objections. Does inordinate censoring curtail a filmmaker’s freedom of expression?
I thought there was no need for [the cuts]. A censor board should not be constituted by people affiliated to political parties. It should consist of society’s intellectuals, thinkers, artists, writers, human rights activists and educationists. Only then can it operate in a democratic setup.
Creators should be allowed their freedom. Charlie Chaplin made a film on Hitler when the latter was at the height of his powers. Even today, in the USA, there is space for films that criticise their Presidents. 
An argument or opinion should be taken on by a counter opinion or argument, and not by blocking or changing it.
The politics over a woman’s agency is one of the strong points in Gypsy.
Women have always been used as a weapon either by an individual or a Government in times of war and conflict.

The problem starts with viewing a woman as someone who holds our (the society’s) honour because that then gives cause for harming the honour. You see how even in cases of honour killing, the woman is the first target. 
We have a duty to oppose and raise our voice against this. Women are not things; she is a soul, she is a human being. An education system, a political structure and a democracy that teaches this is what we need. 
Another criticism was the use of a misrepresented community to discuss or expose the shortcomings of patriarchy.
I did not place it in a religion. In our society, all religions and families harbour such thoughts. I wanted to bring forth the male mentality. My female lead character gets an opportunity to realise the difference between her family and Gypsy through those scenes. 
The film’s conclusion leaves space for several what ifs. For one, the scene’s composition did not feel organic.

What I wanted to say in the end was that there is no division among people irrespective of the category or class they belong to. There is humanity and love in all of them and the divisions are being sowed by an administration, out of someone’s selfish desire. So, when the characters meet, there is a sense of forgiveness and humanity. I don’t see what is problematic there.
We are not suggesting the message was any less valid... just that the viewer may feel disinvested by that point.
That is your opinion and I respect and accept that. But you must understand that you and Gypsy are not the same.
You have a house, an office to go and work at; the people you and he meets are not the same, you don’t share the same kind of interactions. In the film, I try to convey that there is a relationship between Gypsy and someone he meets in a single montage because he meets so many people. In your life, it wouldn’t be a montage. It could be a scene or even the entire first half (smiles).

Why is Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 movie ‘Contagion’ suddenly viral? It predicted the coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/why-is-steven-soderberghs-2011-movie-contagion-suddenly-viral-it-predicted-the-coronavirus/article31067989.ece,"The 2011 sci-fi/ drama movie Contagion directed by Steven Soderbergh, is suddenly everywhere in the news.
People across the world are renting it, trying to stream it online and binge-watching it... nine years after its release. iTunes has listed it the fourth-most rented movie now, after the US declared a state of emergency. It is also the second most-watched movie in Warner Bros.’ catalogue in 2020.
But why? The events of the movie eerily, even prophetically, predict the outbreak of a deadly virus that causes a pandemic — and it is spread because a chef in Macao didn't wash his hands after handling infected pork meat, and then shakes hands with Gwyneth Paltrow's character!
Starring the likes of Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard and Laurence Fishbourne, the film begins with Gwyneth Paltrow’s character returning to the USA after contracting a strange illness in Hong Kong. With a few days, she dies, leaving her husband, played by Matt Damon in shock, as the symptoms begin spreading, and becomes an official outbreak.
It is learnt that the virus originated is MEV-1, that spreads after “the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat,” in the words of one scientist in the film.







With the several theories on the spread of COVD-19 from the Wuhan food and animal market in China, it’s no wonder that the themes in the film resonate with people today, fighting to battle the spread of the coronavirus.
Contagion also offers a deep and surprisingly well-researched insight into pandemic procedurals and worst-case scenarios, with chilling images of empty airports, vacant cities and people quarantined in special wards or their homes itself: all of which can be identified with in the current climate.
While director Soderbergh has yet to comment on the sudden virality of his movie, Contagion writer Scott Z. Burns spoke out recently against the Donald Trump administration for not responding appropriately to the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.
“It’s stunning to me that our administration can’t put out a clear message on how people can stay safe and what our tools are for understanding the current spread. There’s a video on YouTube of a song they did in Vietnam about hand-washing and how important it is. Why isn’t our government putting out public service messages about how to stay safe? That isn’t that hard,” he said.
The 2011 movie was a box office, grossingover $136 million worldwide at the time of release.",movies
"TIFR study reveals role of glucose in regulating liver functions, ageing",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/tifr-study-reveals-role-of-glucose-in-regulating-liver-functions-ageing/article31069620.ece,"An enzyme that goes by the name SIRT1 is known to be associated with regulation of metabolic activities and also ageing and hence has become a target of therapeutics. A study by researchers from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (TIFR) shows that glucose controls the function of SIRT1 directly. A shortage or absence of this control can lead to a diabetic-like state, while excess feeding and sustained low levels of SIRT1 can lead to obesity and enhanced ageing. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
There are many diseases related to high calorie content in the body, such as metabolic disorders as shown in animal studies. Studies have shown that metabolic diseases are associated with wrong feeding regimen, even in humans. Every organism has evolved so as to feed and then alternately fast, so it becomes important to understand this cycle. This cycle, known as the feed-fast cycle is a basic pattern and the metabolism related to this is largely taken care of by the liver.
In an earlier work, published in Cell Reports, researchers in the lab of Ullas Kolthur-Seetharam from the Department of Biological Sciences at TIFR, found the mechanism that triggers the liver to go from one stage to another in the feed-fast cycle. 
 
Now, working on a different angle, the group has discovered that glucose controls the functions of a protein SIRT1 which in turn maintains everyday feed-fast cycles and is also associated with longevity. “In normal healthy individuals, SIRT1 protein levels are known to increase during fasting and decrease during feed, which is essential to maintain a balance between glucose and fat metabolism,” says Prof Kolthur-Seetharam.
“Despite decades of work on the beneficial roles of SIRT1, metabolic factors that decrease its functions both during normal feed-fast cycles and in nutrient excess states (like obesity) was unknown,” explains Tandrika Chattopadhyay, who is the first author of the PNAS paper in an email to The Hindu.
“While there is active research to identify drugs that can activate SIRT1 which would be beneficial in countering ageing and metabolic diseases, the cost of uncontrolled overactivation of SIRT1 has not been investigated especially since it decreases in a healthy individual in a fed state,” says Dr. Chattopadhyay.
Glucose puts a check on the activity of SIRT1 in the fed state. In the absence of this check, SIRT1 activity increases and results in hyperglycaemia in a fasted state, mimicking diabetic state. “Constant feeding or high calorie intake that leads to sustained reduction in the levels of SIRT1 (by glucose) is associated with ageing and obesity,” she says.
“Our study shows that both over-activation and under-activation of this longevity factor could lead to diseases,” she adds.
 
This study paves the way to regulating this modification, which might be beneficial in tackling lifestyle disorders and ageing related diseases.
The group next seeks to investigate if glucose-dependent control can dictate gene expression during feed-fast cycles. “Also, we would like to investigate if small chemical molecules or drugs can selectively activate SIRT1 which could be used in the clinic to either increase or decrease the levels of SIRT1, as per the needs of the individual,” says Prof. Kolthur-Seetharam.",science
Trial shows success in treating drug-resistant TB,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/trial-shows-success-in-treating-drug-resistant-tb/article31069610.ece,"A small trial (Nix-TB) undertaken at three sites in South Africa to test the safety and efficacy of three oral drugs — bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid — in 109 patients (57 males and 56 females were HIV positive) with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) showed encouraging results — treatment success rate was 90%. The favourable results held true regardless of the HIV status of the patients. 
The treatment using the three oral drugs lasted for 26 weeks and was followed-up for six months after the end of the treatment. Patients received the treatment daily for 26 weeks. The trial of 109 patients included 71 who had XDR-TB and 38 with MDR-TB. 
The 90% treatment success in the case of hard-to-treat patients is at par with the success rate seen while treating drug-sensitive TB. Of the 109 patients treated, 11 had unfavourable outcomes while 98 had favourable outcomes. Of the 11 patients who had unfavourable outcomes, there were seven deaths and two had a relapse during the six-month follow-up period. Of the 98 patients who were successfully treated using the three drugs, 63 patients had XDR-TB and 35 had MDR-TB. The treatment success rate was 89% (63 of 71) for XDR-TB and 92% (35 of 38). The MDR-TB patients included in the trial were either not responsive to standard treatment or had discontinued treatment due to side effects.
“This study shows that XDR tuberculosis and complicated MDR tuberculosis can be treated with a regimen consisting of three oral agents for 26 weeks,” the authors write. The results of the study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
Of the three drugs used in the trial, a “high-percentage” of patients experienced adverse effects related to linezolid drug. Of the 109 patients treated, 88 patients (81%) had peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbing and pain usually of hands and feet due to nerve damage), though the symptoms were mild to moderate in the majority of cases.
 Two patients developed optic neuritis, where the optic nerve becomes inflamed, which was resolved when linezolid drug was withdrawn. Also, 40 had anaemia, while eight patients had adverse event of the liver and the regime had to be interrupted (but they eventually resumed and completed the 26-week treatment). ",science
Heat stress may impact over 1.2 billion people annually by 2100: study ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/heat-stress-may-impact-over-12-billion-people-annually-by-2100-study/article31069592.ece,"Stress from extreme heat and humidity will annually impact areas which are home to about 1.2 billion people worldwide by 2100, assuming current greenhouse gas emissions, according to a study.
 This is more than four times the number of people affected today, and more than 12 times the number who would have been affected without industrial era global warming, said researchers from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in the US.
 Rising global temperatures are increasing exposure to heat stress, which harms human health, agriculture, the economy and the environment, according to the research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.
 Most climate studies on projected heat stress have focused on heat extremes but not considered the role of humidity, another key driver, the researchers said.
 “When we look at the risks of a warmer planet, we need to pay particular attention to combined extremes of heat and humidity, which are especially dangerous to human health,” said senior author Robert E Kopp, from Rutgers University-New Brunswick.
 “Every bit of global warming makes hot, humid days more frequent and intense. In New York City, for example, the hottest, most humid day in a typical year already occurs about 11 times more frequently than it would have in the 19th century,” said lead author Dawei Li, a former post-doctoral associate at Rutgers, and now at the University of Massachusetts.
 Heat stress is caused by the body’s inability to cool down properly through sweating. Body temperature can rise rapidly, and high temperatures may damage the brain and other vital organs.
 Heat stress ranges from milder conditions like heat rash and heat cramps to heat exhaustion, the most common type.
 The study looked at how combined extremes of heat and humidity increase on a warming Earth, using 40 climate simulations to get statistics on rare events.
 It focused on a measure of heat stress that accounts for temperature, humidity and other environmental factors, including wind speed, sun angle and solar and infrared radiation.
 Annual exposure to extreme heat and humidity in excess of safety guidelines is projected to affect areas currently home to about 500 million people if the planet warms by 1.5 degrees Celsius, and nearly 800 million at 2 degrees Celsius, the researchers said.
 The planet has already warmed by about 1.2 degrees above late 19th century levels, the said.
 An estimated 1.2 billion people would be affected with 3 degrees Celsius of warming, as expected by the end of this century under current global policies, according to the study. ",science
The time is right for OneHealth science ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-time-is-right-for-onehealth-science/article31069639.ece,"As India goes into emergency mode to tackle the potentially catastrophic impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the ‘Kerala model’ is being widely cited as an example to emulate. In 2018, Kerala reacted quickly and efficiently to tackle the Nipah virus outbreak and successfully managed to confine it to 23 cases. This success has been credited to the strong public health infrastructure and the political will to quickly seek help from a multidisciplinary team of national and international experts. The Kerala Nipah virus outbreak was thought to have come from fruit bats, a group of animals that may also be implicated in other more deadly outbreaks, possibly including the novel coronavirus.
These diseases, which “spillover” from animals to humans are referred to as zoonotic diseases, and represent more than 60% of emerging infectious diseases worldwide. The destruction of the natural environment, globalised trade and travel and industrialised food production systems have created numerous pathways for new pathogens to jump between animals and humans. Understanding this critical intersection between human health, domestic and wild animal health and the environment requires a new integrated framework — a paradigm called ‘OneHealth’.
Although OneHealth, as a conceptual entity, emerged relatively recently, a stellar example of OneHealth being operationalised in the field was seen in India in the late 1950s. It helped discover the source of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a highly dangerous haemorrhagic fever more threatening than COVID-19. It was locally called ‘monkey fever’ because of the links between monkey deaths and human infections in Shimoga District of Karnataka where it emerged in 1957. It took pioneering interdisciplinary work to bring together diverse entities like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Virus Research Centre (later the National Institute of Virology), Pune, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bombay Natural History Society.
The Rockefeller Foundation provided the financial and technical support, including laboratory facilities, while P.K. Rajagopalan and a team of dedicated researchers from the Virus Research Centre combed the forests of the Western Ghats for potential carriers and autopsied monkeys in their investigations into the cause of the disease. The legendary bird man of India, Salim Ali, supported by WHO funds, tagged migratory birds to rule out the possibility that they were carrying pathogens responsible for the disease in their cross-continental flights.
As successful as the epidemiological investigation into KFD was, it largely remained an isolated example. This model of cross-sectoral collaboration did not set the tone for further research along similar lines or fructify into readying our public health system to address zoonotic diseases. To our great loss, everyone slipped back into their silos. Many decades later, India is yet to operationalise a true OneHealth policy.
Further, the regulatory framework for doing OneHealth research in India with international collaboration typically requires approvals from multiple authorities, including ICMR, the Ministries of External Affairs and Finance, Directorate General of the Armed Forces, National Biodiversity Authority, Committee for the Purpose of Control & Supervision of Experiments on Animals and State health authorities, among others. Additional permissions are required from state forest authorities and biodiversity boards for accessing biological resources within natural landscapes. While the necessity for research permits is not being questioned, the range of permissions needed and the long waiting periods (ranging from three months to more than a year), raises the issue of whether we are unwittingly hampering our ability to rapidly respond to emerging threats from infectious diseases.
Given our pioneering historical contribution to combat zoonotic diseases, and robust institutional framework for biomedical research, India has the opportunity to take the lead in combating the massive public health crisis posed by emerging infectious diseases. An opportunity now exists for India to leap-frog over the systemic and institutional barriers that prevent an integrated OneHealth framework from being operationalised.
The Government of India has recently launched the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-being. The mission aims to explore the neglected links between biodiversity science and human well-being across the sectors of health, economic development, agricultural production and livelihood generation, in combination with efforts to mitigate climate change and related disasters. One of the components of the mission explicitly links biodiversity to human health through the OneHealth framework.
The OneHealth programme aims to encourage team science by having networks of institutions collectively bid for grants to set up integrated OneHealth surveillance systems across India at 25 sentinel surveillance sites in potential emerging infectious disease hotspots. In this manner, government and private institutions, across a range of disciplines, from virology to epidemiology, genomics to ecology, and social and behavioural sciences to veterinary and animal sciences can collaborate to understand how zoonotic diseases can emerge, the threats they can pose, and the mechanisms by which the emergence or spread can be controlled.
The frequency with which new pathogens are emerging or old ones are re-emerging across the world are alarm calls for greater transparency, cross-country collaborations, and enhanced national infrastructure and capacity for integrated OneHealth science. The cause of mitigating large-scale human suffering justifies making such a hitherto unprecedented effort.

Superhydrophobic coating to save metallic surfaces,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/superhydrophobic-coating-to-save-metallic-surfaces/article31069547.ece,"Fascinated by the beauty of water rolling off a lotus leaf, a team of chemical engineers has now created a similar superhydrophobic coating that can be used to save steel from rusting.
The team from the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, and Ohio State University used polyurethane and silicon dioxide nanoparticles to create the coating which can be easily spin-coated on steel.
“Not just steel, the coating can be done on other metallic surfaces, such as aluminum, copper, brass. We have also successfully developed superhydrophobic coatings for glass, cloth, paper and wood,” explains Aditya Kumar from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad and one of the corresponding authors of the work published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A.
Before applying the coating, the team created a roughness on the steel using a chemical etching process to improve the adhesion strength. Without this, the coating tends to easily peal off due to smoothness of steel.
The team also tried different methods for the application of the coat on steel and found that spin coating was advantageous and cost-effective compared to immersion coating and spray coating. Spin coating dried quickly and the thickness of the coat could be controlled easily.
The surface of the coating was found to have superhydrophobic property. The coating was also chemically stable in both acidic (pH 5) and alkaline (pH 8) conditions for more than six weeks. It also exhibited thermal stability up to 230 degree C.
The mechanical stability of the coating was tested with water jet, floating, bending, sand abrasion tests and was found to be highly stable.
Another useful property exhibited by the coating was of self-cleaning. When water droplets were made to fall on an uncoated surface they stuck to it and made a messy surface.
However, in the case of a coated sample, water droplets roll away while collecting dust from the surface.
“The chemicals used to make the coating are easily available in our country and they are environmental friendly too. When mass-produced on commercial scale, the cost of coating will further reduce,” adds Mukesh Kumar Meena, first author of the paper who completed his M.Tech from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad.
Now the team is working on developing an antimicrobial superhydrophobic coating for biomedical applications.",science

Fury won’t lose world title: WBC chief ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/fury-wont-lose-world-title-wbc-chief/article31075782.ece,"Tyson Fury’s reign as world heavyweight champion will not be ended by new claims over an alleged drug-testing scam, according to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman. 
It was alleged in a Mail on Sunday report a farmer was offered money to provide an alibi for Fury’s failed drugs test in 2015.
Fury and his cousin Hughie tested positive for nandrolone in 2015, which they subsequently blamed on eating uncastrated wild boar meat, citing a farmer called Martin Carefoot who claimed to have provided them with the product. 
After an expensive and elongated stand-off with UK Anti-Doping, Fury and Hughie received retrospective two-year bans and were able to resume their careers in December 2017.

Besides Rijiju, the other members of the delegation included Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra, secretary-general Rajeev Mehta, Boxing Federation of India president Ajay Singh, sports secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya and Sports Authority of India director general Sandip Pradhan.
“The proposed visit of High Level Indian Delegation to Tokyo consisting of Govt Officials and Indian Olympic Association to review India’s #Tokyo2020 preparation on 25th March is temporarily postponed,” Rijiju tweeted.
Mehta told PTI, “In view of the rising threat of this COVID-19 pandemic, the visit has been put on hold. As of now, we have not decided when the delegation will visit Tokyo. It will happen at a later date depending on the situation.”
India will have its first-ever Olympic Hospitality House in Tokyo during the Summer Games, scheduled to be held from July 24 to August 9. It will be built by JSW on a piece of land of 2,200 square metre area and in close proximity to the Games Village and multiple venues in the Ariake region of the Japanese capital.
It will offer a range of activities and experiences for travelling fans and supporters who will be in Tokyo for the Olympics. 
Running through the duration of the Games, the India House will host watch parties, medal celebrations and meet-and-greet opportunities with the Indian athletes. The visitors will also get a taste of variety of Indian cuisine.
There will be a dedicated Athlete Lounge for Indian Olympians and access to medical facilities and food will be available on site. A media centre to host travelling Indian media personnel has also been planned in the area. Several Indian and international brands will also have their stalls to display and sell their products.
More than 70 Indian athletes have so far qualified for the Tokyo Olympics and the IOA is expecting the number to touch at least 125 before the Games.
The coronavirus outbreak has led to speculation over the fate of the Olympics this year. 
The International Olympic Committee (IOC), however, has insisted that the Games will be held as scheduled in July-August.",other sports
Biles takes swipe at USA Gymnastics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/biles-takes-swipe-at-usa-gymnastics/article31075718.ece,"Four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles wants more than good wishes from USA Gymnastics. 
The US federation wished Biles a happy 23rd birthday on social media on Saturday. 
Biles — who also owns 19 world titles and is expected to be among the stars of the Tokyo Olympics — used the tweet as a chance to demand an independent investigation into the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal. 
“How about you amaze me and do the right thing ... have an independent investigation,” Biles snapped on Twitter after the federation’s birthday tweet. 
“HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most decorated gymnast of all time, @simonebiles!” USA Gymnastics wrote, posting a video of Biles in action in a floor exercise. 
“We know you will only continue to amaze us and make history!” 
Former national gymnastics team doctor Nassar was jailed for life for abusing more than 250 athletes, including stars of the United States’ 2012 and 2016 gold medal-winning Olympic teams.
A US Senate investigation found that “multiple institutions” failed to adequately respond to credible allegations against Nassar, but Biles has said that USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee still owe his victims, including herself, more answers and a framework to ensure such abuses won’t occur again. 
“Wish they BOTH wanted an independent investigation as much as the survivors & I do,” she tweeted earlier this month. 
As Biles and other elite gymnasts ramp up their preparations for Tokyo, USA Gymnastics in January offered a $215 million settlement to victims of Nassar to settle legal claims — a plan a lawyer for more than 200 women called “unconscionable.” 
Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who is now retired, called the settlement offer “offensive” and accused the federation of attempting to prevent release of details which would show how Nassar was able to abuse athletes for years. 
Attorney John Manley, who represents more than 180 clients with active claims against USA Gymnastics, said the settlement offer releases too many people from further claims, including the USOPC, former USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Marta Karolyi.",other sports
Coronavirus | London Marathon postponed to October,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-london-marathon-postponed-to-october/article31071425.ece," This year’s London Marathon, which was supposed to take place on April 24, has been postponed to October 4 due to the global outbreak of coronavirus.
The organizers have said that every runner with a place will be able to use their place in the rescheduled event without any further payment. If they choose not to take part or are unable to do so, they will receive a refund of their entry fee.
Runners may also choose to defer their entry to the 2021 race, which is scheduled for April 25 next year, on payment of the entry fee for 2021, following the standard deferment process.
Event director Hugh Brasher said: “The world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of COVID-19 and public health is everyone’s priority. We know how disappointing this news will be for so many — the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year,” he added. 
Earlier, elite football in Britain, including the Premier League, was suspended until at least April 3.
In a statement released on Friday, the Premier League said: “Following a meeting of Shareholders today, it was unanimously decided to suspend the Premier League with the intention of returning on April 4, subject to medical advice and conditions at the time.”",other sports

The world no. 18 Chandra outclassed compatriot Thakkar 11-6, 11-7, 13-11 in the all-Indian final that lasted just 24 minutes.
After losing the first two sets without much fight, Thakkar tried to make a comeback with a good display. However, a determined Chandra wrapped up the final set and match to clinch the gold.
The U-21 men’s singles competition saw dominance of Indian paddlers as Thakkar, Chandra, Manush Shah and Suravajjula Snehit make their way into the the semifinals.

With the women’s team camp ending at Sports Authority of India (SAI) here, Marijne was keen to fly to the Netherlands to join his family. 
He was on the way to the airport, before he decided to back out.
Marijne was perhaps concerned that he may face difficulty entering the Netherlands. 
Marijne also realised that his re-entry to India could have posed problems.
Overcome with doubt, the 45-year-old decided to cancel his trip home, and returned to SAI.
 He is expected to stay at SAI until the uncertainty surrounding international travel subsides. 
“Had to turn around on my way to the airport to go to my family.

Team is improving under Reid: Birendra Lakra,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/team-is-improving-under-reid-birendra-lakra/article31071189.ece,"India coach Graham Reid, known for his inclination towards an aggressive brand of hockey, is also a firm believer that a strong defence can win tournaments, national team defender Birendra Lakra said on Saturday.
 India displayed some spectacular attacking game in the FIH Hockey Pro League matches last month, beating the likes of Australia and Belgium.
“Playing aggressive and attacking hockey, pushing for goals and circle penetrations is the style we as a team want to use,” Lakra said.
 The 30-year-old said that the Australian is very clear about his expectations from the team’s defence.
 “Although chief coach Graham’s training often involves high intensity sessions where he likes to see quality attack, he is also very clear about his expectations from the team’s defence. Graham tells us that a strong line of defence can not only win matches but it can also win us tournaments.” 
Lakra believes the team is improving under the tutelage of Reid.
“In the past, there have been times when we have slipped up in defence in the final moments of the match. But I believe we have improved in this aspect over the past couple of months and the coach often says our defence starts with our forwardline.” 
Lakra who had missed the 2016 Rio Olympics due to a knee surgery is working towards securing a spot in the team for the Tokyo Games.
“I may be an experienced defender in the team but I can’t take my place for granted.
“Each one of us have to earn our place in the squad for Tokyo and this means we give our 100% in training and matches.
“I was very unlucky to miss the Rio Olympic Games due to injury but this time I am really working hard to play the best hockey for my team,” Lakra said.",other sports

“This is more so with those players who have been travelling around the world in search of winning important points to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. 
“I cannot straight away comment on the likely impact of the fresh guidelines to be issued for the qualification for Olympics. We need to know the cut-off date and the number of tournaments the players, especially those aspiring from India, can play to make the cut for the Games,” the former All England champion said.
“Unless, there is a clear message detailing the qualification norms, what sort of impact they will have on the players, especially those aspiring to make it from India,” the former All England champion said.

"Yes Bank posts ₹18,564 cr. Q3 loss ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/yes-bank-posts-18564-cr-q3-loss/article31071471.ece,"Private sector lender Yes Bank posted a whopping ₹18,564 crore loss for the third quarter of the current financial year as bad loans surged. The bank had posted a net profit of ₹1,000 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year.
The lender had delayed the announcement of its earnings for the third quarter. Last week, the government had put the lender under moratorium while dismantling the board and appointed an administrator.
Gross non-performing assets went up to ₹40,709 crore, which is 18.87% of gross advances, from ₹17,134 crore, or 7.39%, at the end of the second quarter. Net NPAs jumped to ₹11,114 crore from ₹9,757 crore sequentially. As a result, provisions excluding tax expenses, were ₹24,765 crore for the third quarter as compared to ₹1,336 crore reported in the second quarter. The bank recognised additional provisions of ₹15,422 crore in the most recent quarter.
Higher provisions depleted its capital adequacy ratio, which fell much below the regulatory requirement. The ratio as on end December 2019 was 4.1%, as compared to 16.3% in end September.
The bank said its deposit base was reduced from ₹2,09,497 crore as on September 30, 2019 to ₹1,65,755 crore as on December 31, 2019. “The impact of the said moratorium on the depositor confidence is uncertain. However, the bank has additional liquidity from RBI and expects to raise funds from CD issuance to take care of any probable outflow of deposits on withdrawal of the moratorium,” the bank said in the notes of account. 
For the nine-month period, the loss of the bank stood at ₹19,046 crore.
“The bank has a total deferred tax asset of ₹8,029.2 crore as at December 31, 2019. Based on financial projections approved by the administrator, the bank is expected to have sufficient future taxable income to utilise the said deferred tax assets,” the lender said. 
“The bank has Basel III complaint additional Tier 1 bonds of ₹8,695 crore and believes AT 1 bonds amounting to ₹8,695 crore can be utilised to enhance the common equity as of date,” the notes said.",business
Prataya Saha's 'The Good Wife': The long and short of patriarchy ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-good-wife-addresses-the-long-and-short-of-patriarchy/article31076414.ece,"A woman covering her face with a saree pallu (loose end of the saree) scurries through narrow bylanes of Kolkata, defying a riot-induced curfew, in search of fish to cook her husband’s favourite meal, for it is their wedding anniversary — this is the opening shot of the short film, The Good Wife, by independent film-maker Prataya Saha.
The film, set in 1992 Kolkata, was screened last week at Auroville’s Cinema Paradiso.
The first few scenes quickly establish the protagonist’s character as a stereotypical wife of the 1990s — eager to please the husband, leads a life of sacrifice and subjugation under an abusive, alcoholic husband.
Through a series of quick cuts and carefully crafted sound design — music on the radio, the ticking of a pendulum clock and the scraping of utensils — the film takes viewers on a journey into a day in the life of ‘the good wife’.
For the most part, the film delves on the woman’s uncomplaining acceptance of her life, shown through fleeting thoughts of emptiness that cross her mind. After devoting herself to serving her husband, cooking his favourite meals, eating from leftovers, she wonders why he doesn’t so much as glance at her with an iota of love. 
“Whose fragrance do you carry”, she helplessly asks while washing his shirt one day, to a whiff of unfamiliar perfume.
The film ends in a decisive act of rebellion by the protagonist against her husband, portrayed more as an embodiment of patriarchy than a mere character.
The 17-minute film, from the stable of Bengaluru-based Red Polka Productions founded by Anshulika Kapoor who also plays the lead character, has been on an awards-winning spree. 
It has so far won 12 awards globally and has been selected for over 20 international film festivals. The film has also been exclusively curated by various platforms, most notably by SRFTI, Kolkata.
The short has won best film awards in Chicago and Toronto, a slew of awards at the Vipra International Film Festival in Kochi, and the best actress award at Continental Film Festival, Toronto. More recently, it won the jury award for best film at Chennai International Short Film Festival.
“That the film still speaks to audiences across geographies is an eye-opener really and attests to the fact that the plight of women trapped in abusive marriages is universally relatable,” said Mr. Saha.

“In the contemporary world perhaps, a woman might have alternative choices to get out of an abusive relationship. But, in those times (the 1990s), women suffered silently for the sake of family honour, lacked confidantes and were socially conditioned to remain in abusive relationships,” said the film-maker, who derived inspiration for the movie from a traumatic marital relationship of an aunt. 
This is as much a story of a woman’s realisation that her love for her husband is the outcome of years of social conditioning, as a tribute to her immense inner power. “Maybe not the power or strength with chest thumping, typical of toxic masculinity, but a more subtler, inner feminine strength”.
“We not only transport the audience visually to an era from 25 years ago, but also retrospectively throw light on how little (or how much) has changed over the last two-and-a-half decades in the lives of these seemingly ‘good wives’,” he said.
The short film’s sound design/music is by Sandeep Sugunan and editing by Raihan Siddique.
Prataya Saha has several short films and a play — Chitraa, a Rabindranath Tagore adaptation — to his credit. He said the The Good Wife is the breakthrough in his career. In the vein of exploring socio-political issues, he is now working on a film that deals with water scarcity crisis “as seen through the eyes of a child” and another film, titled Newly Weds, which tackles the fading out of interpersonal communication in the new age.
“This is a great time for independent cinema. There is a proliferation of video-delivery platforms and digital devices creating new commercial value for content. And, the shorter the better, given how much attention spans have shrunk”, he said.",movies
Coronavirus | Concern over future of daily wage earners as Indian film bodies decide to halt all shoots,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-concern-over-future-of-daily-wage-earners-as-film-bodies-decide-to-halt-all-shoots/article31076042.ece," The Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association (IMPPA) on Sunday called for a halt of shoots of all entertainment formats in view of the spread of the COVID-19. A joint meeting of the leading bodies — IMPPA, Western India Film Producers’ Association (WIFPA), Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC), Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association (IFTDA) and Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) — arrived at the unanimous decision to stop shooting of films, TV serials, web series and all other entertainment, including digital formats, from March 19 to March 31.
The film units shooting till then have been advised to follow all precautionary and preventive measures without fail.

Concerns were raised about life ahead for the daily wage earners, the light boys, spotboys, set workers, carpenters, painters, sound assistants, junior artistes and junior technicians and stuntsperson etc who would be the most affected by the decision. Like in the case of demonetisation in 2016, the closure will be most crippling for the humblest workforce. 
“How can the industry come together to help the daily wagers? They’re the ones who’ll be cast adrift when the production lockdown comes into effect,” tweeted producer Anupama Mandloi. “How do the workers that live off daily wages make their ends meet? We must put our heads together. We are not getting past this problem in a hurry…” tweeted filmmaker Anubhav Sinha. Filmmakers like Sudhir Mishra and Hansal Mehta spoke about setting up funds, with Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap voicing support.
“During such times it is practically impossible to set up a machinery in place quickly. A machine that will collect monies from all of us and then will disburse to the needy,” filmmaker Anubhav Sinha told The Hindu. According to him setting up a large fund and its management would be complex and he proposed that each filmmaker could look after and cover workers from their previous films. “So what I am doing is that any daily wage worker from my last film who has an urgent need because of the shoot cancellations can reach out to the respective head of department (HoD) and then the HoD will reach out to me and I will do the best that I can do,” he said.
The decision on the resumption of shoots will be taken on March 30 after taking the prevailing conditions into consideration. ",movies

Movie festivals such as SXSW in Texas and Tribeca in New York have been scrapped in recent days as the deadly pandemic spreads. This has shorn major titles of the publicity generated by opening night reviews and galas, and left hundreds of unsold indie films without distributors.

Coronavirus: All the movies, TV shows and festivals delayed or shut down globally

The makers of The Carnivores, a quirky thriller-meets-love story set to debut at SXSW, took matters into their own hands by shifting the “premiere” to the cinematographer Adam Minnick’s Austin home.
“We have full catering, we have a red carpet, we have a photographer coming, we have local news,” said director Caleb Michael Johnson.
The red carpet will run from the front porch, through the house, and back to a taco stand — which is being catered for free by a local sponsor.
The idea emerged from a bar conversation the day the festival was cancelled.
“Our world premiere was on Saturday 14th and dammit we wanted to still have our screening on Saturday 14th in Austin.”
The same tactic was employed by U.S. actor David Arquette, whose documentary about his controversial forays into pro wrestling shifted from a SXSW premiere to his home near Hollywood within 24 hours.

"A comedian’s role is limited, says ‘Orrey Bujjiga’ actor-comedian Saptagiri",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/comedian-saptagiri-saptagiri-llb-orrey-bujjiga/article31074048.ece,"Saptagiri is returning as a comedian in multiple films but hasn’t given up on playing lead roles. He says that it is a myth that comedians can’t flourish as heroes and cites Saptagiri Express and Saptagiri LLB as an example to prove his statement. He has done a special role in Orrey Bujjiga, starring Raj Tarun and as it draws closer to release, he speaks about how careful he is when it comes to playing a hero and it is a misconception that he is averse to playing a cameo in other projects. “My two films did well but Vajrakavachadara Govinda did not. My success rate is around 60 percent and I’m choosing stories that suit me. As a lead, I ensure I don’t repeat roles that I did in over in 150 films I worked in. My monologue from Dana Veera Doora Karna from one of my films won applause and it satiated my thirst as an artiste. Our work as a comedian in films is limited so these intermittent projects which I take up as a hero makes me happy. I may not have got 100 marks, but I did pass the test,” he says about his two films.
He says he’s aware that it doesn’t make sense to spend more money on his films and only when done in a stipulated budget, the project is safe. None of the producers, he says, have lost money on him. His next is Harilo Ranga Hari, a crime drama. “There is so much competition that if you don’t show variation, you are bound to fail. Every Friday is a challenge, I repeat that we as artistes are capable of expressing all emotions but we are chosen to only make the crowd laugh. We gain sympathy only when we cry and that is possible only when we play lead roles. Any film runs on its subject, it has nothing to do with a hero or comedian. We always hope our films will work. Sometimes it fails and we need to analyse where we went wrong and not blame ourselves for doing a lead role. All we need is to have clarity on what we can and cannot.”
He adds, “Every time people see me they say I should work as a comedian and not ignore star hero’s films but when did I say I left? No one approached me or approaches me. I never issued a statement that I will never work as a comedian. Once you begin playing a hero, people presume we won’t do anything smaller. When ever I got an opportunity I grabbed it. You will see me in Orey bujji ga, Tagithe thandana, Krack and many more are in the pipeline.”
Saptagiri and another comedian ‘Shakalaka’ Shankar are a hit combination. When asked when the duo will be seen again, he says very soon and there’s something in the pipeline. The Chittoor-born Saptagiri began his career as an assistant director in producer Dil Raju’s banner and continued for around seven films. While working in Bommarillu and Parugu, director Bhaskar offered him a role. There was no looking back since then. Vijay Kumar Konda, director of Orey Bujjiga has designed an entertaining episode around him in a hospital in that film and Saptagiri vouches that will have all in splits.
About social media, he refrains from commenting. He says he is a sensitive person, and scared to talk media. “I don’t know what they will write when I say something. So far I never hurt anyone and none hurt me. I always think in a positive way.”
Before signing off he talks of his daily regimen. “I am a vegetarian and do yoga every day which is why I am active. For the past 30 years, surya namaskar and pranayama has become my routine. I do it for 45 minutes to one hour. I never stepped into a gym. Practicing yoga made my body flexible. Turning vegetarian also helped me a great deal.”",movies
Savings can save you,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/savings-can-save-you/article31070550.ece," It was July 26, 2005. The afternoon rain had started its frenzy in the city of Mumbai. 
The rain continued the whole night and well into the next day. 
People were stranded in offices, in trains, in cars and buses. “The whole night, I was sitting in the train, without food to eat, water to drink and no access to washroom facilities to relieve myself,” was the experience of many. 
The next day had its own set of problems. One of the difficulties faced by many was the lack of cash. They had balances in bank accounts but not much at home.
“I always thought, in the case of emergency, I will go across the street and withdraw cash from the ATM,” said a friend. 
Unfortunately, in some parts of low-lying suburban Mumbai, ATMs were submerged in water.
We all end up facing situations in life or sometimes have been witness to situations that are not only unplanned but also unexpected. 
These could be in form of natural or man-made calamities, e.g. torrential rain, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, terrorist attacks or geopolitical situations. These impact the entire region.
There could be some situations which impact a particular individual or a family e.g. loss of income due to job loss, slowdown in the economy, health condition of bread-winner, and the like. At such times, there could be loss of income or an unexpected rise in expenses or both. 
In most situations, there is no formal insurance available and hence, it is prudent to keep aside some funds to meet these vagaries of life.
Most of us who are salaried have a CEO for our organisation. Ever company in whose shares we have invested has a CEO. 
As individuals, we have no control over these CEOs even though they directly or indirectly impact our lives.
However, there is one CEO over whom we do have control, and that is our Contingencies and Emergencies Options (CEO). These are funds kept aside to help us deal with adversities in times of stress. We all have heard the saying ‘a stitch in time saves nine.’ 
Whether it saves nine or ten, I don’t know, but if there are funds kept aside for contingencies and emergencies, that would certainly enhance our ability to deal with adversity.
During such times, there will be emotional trauma and financial stress. If there are adequately planned contingencies and emergencies options in place, then our emotional trauma will dilute significantly.
Usually, most financial planners recommend we keep aside funds equivalent to about three months’ mandatory expenses for emergencies. Three months, or 90 days, is sufficient time to come to terms with any kind of trauma.
How long-lasting the scare from trauma is, is dependent on each individual’s frame of mind but in most instances, within about 90 days, life starts limping back to normalcy. 
Advice to elderly who are dependent on investments and pension could be to keep aside about 180 days’ reserve. In some extreme cases, advice is also to set aside provision for 220/240 days.
After deciding on how much to keep, the next question that comes to mind is where to keep these funds. Here, the recommendation is to keep funds equivalent to about one week’s expenses in the form of cash at home. 
Even today, in most parts of the country, vegetable vendors, milkmen and their ilk prefer cash; more so, if it is a calamity-struck area. The remaining funds may be parked in a savings bank account. This account should be linked to a fixed deposit.
 ‘What kind of returns should I expect on these funds?’ was a question posed to me in an investor awareness programme. 
Please do not think of returns, tax benefit etc. on funds set aside for emergencies. The only focus should be to ensure a portion of it should be available any time and the rest should be accessible at the earliest with the least effort.
Preparation is about taking action. Prediction, a lot many times, is manifestation of inner fears due to hearsay, gossip and rumours.
We are witnessing the pandemic of COVID-19. It is difficult to predict the future but at our end, we can always take small steps to ensure that if there is a slowdown, loss or reduction in income, there is sufficient financial armour to meet our routine expenses for a while.

A. Even if you are less than 60, you can invest in the Post Office Senior Citizens’ Scheme. The law says: “an individual of the age of 55 years or more but less than 60 years who has retired on superannuation or under VRS can also open account subject to the condition that the account is opened within one month of receipt of retirement benefits and amount should not exceed the amount of retirement benefits.” So, you can invest up to ₹15 lakh (maximum permitted) in your name as soon as you retire. The balance can be invested in a combination of large bank FDs, post office time deposit and select top-rated corporate deposits. If you are familiar with mutual funds, you can also consider liquid funds and do a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP). It would be very tax efficient. Assume you generate an average 7%, or ₹7 lakh of income, from your corpus per annum. If this is more than adequate, then reduce investments in the above safe options and invest a small proportion in some quality hybrid funds under the category of equity savings. This will also provide some tax efficiency and earn debt-like returns.

A. It is good to close the loan that does not provide any tax benefit. In your case, personal loan repayment should come first. However, we see little need to pledge gold to close any loan. Is your interest rate on pledging gold lower than the personal loan rate? It is unlikely but if that is the case, then it can be a reason to pledge. Else, my candid answer would be to sell gold now (prices are high) and repay, if you don’t need that gold and your monthly cash flows are becoming tight, post EMI.
Karthik
A. For your time frame, you can consider a combination of large bank FDs, short duration debt mutual funds that are consistent and some exposure to equity savings fund. Given your short time frame, we do not wish to recommend any equity exposure.
Varun Dambal
A. Physical form of investing is not an optimal way to organise your investments. You should consider going online. However, there are several platforms that provide you online MF services without demat form. In other words, they are like having a statement, except that it is all online and you can view your investments at any point in an app or laptop. Demat form of investing also helps you consolidate your investments and view them online (assuming your broker is indeed online). But it is not a necessity. If you are already investing in stocks, then holding MFs and stocks in the same demat can help you consolidate. If you aren’t, then you could look at other online options to avoid demat or brokerage charges.

Is the global economy headed for recession?,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/is-the-global-economy-headed-for-recession/article31070618.ece,"The story so far: The global death toll due to COVID-19 has crossed the 5,300 mark, with over 1.42 lakh people infected. India, where 88 people have been infected, saw two casualties when a 76-year old man died in Karnataka and a 68-year-old woman died in Delhi this week. A diverse set of industries has been impacted by the spread of the virus. With daily news reports painting a dismal picture of supply chains affected, it is easy to visualise the global economy virtually grinding to a halt.
Analysts fear that the global economy may tip into a recession unless the virus turns out to be seasonal. (A recession sets in when the economy shows two consecutive quarters of contraction.)
The problem with current predictions is no one knows how long the virus will remain potent, how authorities around the world are able to stanch new cases and the resources they pull out to treat old ones. What business hates is uncertainty and uncertainty is the only thing that abounds when it comes to predictions about the vitality, endurance and longevity of the new virus.
Rabobank has been cited in the media as saying that a global recession now is all but certain. It has predicted global GDP growth to be 1.6% for 2020, a figure that was 2.9% the last year, as per IMF estimates.

Economists from Nomura have warned that a global recession might be inevitable.
This year, in early March, the Institute for International Finance had said that global economic growth could turn out to be as low as 1%, and this was even before the OPEC club and Russia fell out on production agreements to maintain stable oil prices. Oil prices have had a free fall, sending stock markets into a tizzy. The UN’s United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said the virus outbreak could cost the global economy up to $2-trillion this year and that the pandemic could cause a recession in some countries causing global economic growth to clock in below 2.5%.
If you engage less with the outer world, and avoid work, education, fitness and entertainment, a lot less economic activity would occur. Businesses face the challenge of disrupted supply of components to make products, or of having to shut some of their factories temporarily, not to mention large swathes of the workforce having to be quarantined.

There is no industry that has experienced the impact. When China, with the disease’s epicentre in Wuhan, was brought to its knees, the Indian pharmaceutical, automobile and mobile phone industries, for example, immediately wobbled. India depends on China for supplies of components for products that these sectors make.
The Indian pharma industry, which depends on China for 70% of raw materials needed to manufacture drugs here, has seen input costs go up by 50% as of February this year. The pesticides sector is another that has been affected as manufacturers depend on China for raw materials. While there are comforting stock levels for now in India, farmers may soon face pesticide availability issues unless the situation resolves quickly.

The Indian gem and jewellery makers lament the partial closure of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, which is likely to result in a loss of about $1-billion by April this year to the Indian sector which depends on these two foreign markets for 70% of its exports.
Even the software services industry, which so easily lends itself to working from remote locations, can only progress so far. Decision-making in the West, a key market for software services, may have been hit, with in-bound travel restricted and the U.S. declaring emergency. When a health challenge hits you, analysts say the pricing of a technology contract will not be top of the mind.
It is for this reason that the markets have barely taken note of regulators’ attempts to infuse funds into the global economy. A few days ago, the U.S. Federal Reserve held an emergency meeting and cut interest rates by a half percentage point. The stock markets reacted favourably for a short while before losing steam and spiralling downwards.
On Thursday, the Euro markets remained unmoved even after the European Central Bank announced fresh stimulus measures to help the economy cope with the growing cost of the COVID-19 epidemic. But, the U.S. declaring a state of emergency over the spread of the virus will help allocate the significant quantum of funds needed to deal with a health-care requirement of this magnitude. Investors reacted positively to this, and the U.S. markets zoomed in response.
Travel has been hit severely as countries issue advisories to eliminate unnecessary travel and go into lockdown mode. The U.S., for instance, has halted all in-bound travel from Europe. India has temporarily stopped grant of visas except for emergency situations.

The impact on profits of — and jobs at — airlines, airport authorities and oil marketing companies is obvious and immediate, not to mention the economy around air travel — the vendor of coffee and sandwiches pays out a monthly premium to occupy prime airport space so that he can sell you a cappuccino and a sandwich when you pass by his counter.
At an aviation event in Hyderabad the past week, Boeing executives gave rough estimates indicating there had been a 50% reduction in daily flight count in the Asia-Pacific region. In normal times, mainland China would see 15,000 departures a day and at the peak of the virus the country was operating 3,000 flights a day. The rest of Asia-Pacific sees 5,000 flights operated in a day. “At one point we saw 2,500,” said a Boeing executive. As the virus spreads to other markets, airlines in Europe and the U.S. are bound to cut capacity.
Take the example of shared mobility in India. Anecdotal evidence tells us that at steady state, cab drivers cannot quite afford to have their cabs out of circulation for even as short a period as a week, if they have to put food on the table for their families. Curtailed travel and commutes can be devastating for them unless the situation resolves quickly. Only some of the expenses that are being held back by consumers can be made up for later when pent-up demand is unleashed after the situation returns to normal. A postponed vacation may eventually see light of day. But micro-expenses, which contribute significantly to an economy, such as a cab fare or buying snacks for a commute, can never be made up for, once the sun sets that day.
Entertainment via mass media has seen significant impact. The very popular Indian Premier League has been postponed. The South Africa-India cricket series has been cancelled. States such as Kerala have shut down cinema halls for this month. Indian movie releases have been postponed indefinitely.

Globally, the picture is no different. In football, all Union of European Football Association (UEFA) competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League matches, have been postponed. Formula 1 has called off the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix. In golf, the PGA has cancelled its Players’ Championship.
The U.S. basketball association, the National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its season’s events indefinitely while the body that conducts college championships for the sport, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), has cancelled both its men’s and women’s upcoming events. The fate of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo is up in the air.
The iconic Disneyworld has brought down its shutters temporarily to help prevent the spread of the virus – it has shut shop earlier in its history: immediately after President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, and post the 9/11 attacks in New York.
Sales of medical supplies, soaps, hand sanitisers and essentials to be stocked up at home will evidently rise.
It is said that after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China in 2003, shoppers began to prefer buying online, to avoid crowded spaces and that e-commerce major Alibaba’s fortunes zoomed after this. Digital shopping may see even more traction. With schools shutting down temporarily, online learning platforms are likely to get a boost.",economy

Guidelines by the World Health Organization specify that one of the ways to reduce the risk of infection is by regularly and thoroughly cleaning one’s hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. Regular washing becomes important as the virus tends to be viable from hours to more than a day on different surfaces that are regularly touched with hands.

Coronavirus | It could be a truncated IPL, says Ganguly

Viruses such as coronavirus, influenza-causing viruses, Ebola, Zika have their genetic material encased in a layer of fat called the lipid envelop. Soap molecules are pin-shaped with a head that is water-loving (hydrophilic) and a tail that is oil-loving (oleophilic). Being oleophilic, the tail portion of the molecule tends to have an affinity for and ‘competes’ with the lipids in the virus envelope. Since the chemical bonds holding the virus together are not very strong, the long oleophilic tail gets inserted into the envelope and tends to have a ‘crowbar’ effect that breaks the lipid envelope of the virus. The tail also competes with the bond that binds the RNA and the lipid envelop thus dissolving the virus into its components which are then removed by water.
No, certain viruses do not have the lipid envelop and are called the non-enveloped viruses. Rotavirus which causes severe diarrhoea, poliovirus, adenovirus that cause pneumonia and even human papillomavirus (HPV) do not contain the lipid envelop.
Also read: Coronavirus in India | 4,000 under watch
The oil-loving tail of the soap molecule also disrupts the bond that binds dirt and non-enveloped viruses to the hand. The dirt and viruses are surrounded by several tails making them remain as suspended particles. Rinsing with water washes away the suspended particles leading to clean hands.

Like soap, the alcohol present in hand sanitisers dissolve the lipid envelop, thus inactivating the virus. In addition, the alcohol also tends to change the shape or denature the mushroom-shaped protein structures that stick out of the lipid envelop. The mushroom-shaped protein structures help the virus to bind to special structures found on human cells and enter the cells. To be effective, the sanitisers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Unlike soap lather, the alcohol does not come in contact with all parts of the hand. So care needs to be taken to use sufficient amount of sanitiser to increase the coverage. Unlike water, alcohol run does not remove the dead viruses from the hand. While a sanitiser can quickly reduce the number of microbes, it does not get rid of all types of germs, and is “not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy”.

Medical masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. If worn properly, masks may be effective in preventing transmission of coronavirus. An article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) says there is no evidence to suggest that masks worn by healthy individuals can help prevent infection.
But a 2010 study says: “Mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations.”







 
Even the World Health Organization (WHO) says wearing a medical mask is “one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in affected areas”.
Transmission through droplets from coughing and sneezing is one of the major routes of virus spread. When worn correctly, a mask can reduce the risk of inhaling droplets containing the virus.

With many studies showing that people infected with novel coronavirus transmit the virus even before symptoms show up, it may be prudent to wear a mask especially when the virus is spreading in the community.
In a country like India, maintaining at least one metre distance can be a challenge, especially when there is no way of knowing who is infected till such time the person starts showing visible symptoms.
WHO cautions that using a mask alone will be insufficient to provide an “adequate level of protection”. It should be combined with hand hygiene to prevent human-to-human transmission. Wearing medical masks can give a person a “false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential measures such as hand hygiene practices”. So if an individual decides to wear a mask, care must be taken to regularly wash hands with soap or alcohol rub, and avoid touching the face with hands.
Incorrect mask wearing might otherwise reduce the effectiveness in cutting the risk of transmission. It should be discarded once it gets wet or dirty, and care should be taken to safely dispose of used masks. The same mask should not used for more than a couple of hours.",science
Circuit breakers temper market frenzy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/circuit-breakers-temper-market-frenzy/article31070628.ece,"What are market wide circuit breakers?
Market-wide circuit breakers refer to the daily limit — both on the upside and the downside — that the benchmark indices can move in a single day before a trading halt is initiated. The circuit breaker mechanism was introduced in July 2001 as a measure against a significantly huge swings in the Sensex or Nifty. 
Most recently, the circuit breakers were triggered on Friday after the Nifty hit the first limit of 10% soon after the start of the trading session. As per regulations, trading is suspended in both the BSE as well as the National Stock Exchange (NSE), if either of the benchmarks hits the circuit breaker.
What are the circuit limits?
The limits have been pegged at three levels — 10%, 15% and 20% — and the duration of the trading halt has been linked to the time at which the triggers are hit. If any of the benchmarks move 10% before 1 p.m., then trading is halted for 45 minutes. 
Such a movement between 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. entails a 15-minute halt, while a 10% swing after 2:30 p.m. does not call for any trading halt.
A 15% movement in the Sensex or Nifty before 1 p.m. leads to suspension of trade for 1:45 hours while a 15% swing between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. brings trading to a halt for 45 minutes. If the Sensex or Nifty hits the 15% limit after 2 p.m. then trading is suspended for the rest of the day. The maximum market-wide circuit breaker limit has been fixed at 20% and if this trigger is hit at any point of time during the trading session, then trading is halted for the rest of the day.
Are circuit limits revised often?
Earlier, when the concept of ciruit breakers for indices was introduced, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made it mandatory for exchanges to translate these trigger limits in absolute points on a quarterly basis. 
At the end of each quarter, these absolute points were revised and made applicable for the next quarter. From 2013 onwards, the regulator directed stock exchanges to introduce daily calculation of circuit breaker limits based on the previous day’s closing level of the index. 
Additionally, a pre-opening session of 15 minutes was mandated after trading resumed post the compulsory halt.",markets

A shot in the arm,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/former-skipper-shantha-rangaswamy-on-what-worked-and-what-did-not-at-the-womens-t20-world-cup/article31082179.ece,"It was with bated breath that the Indian cricket fans awaited for a triumphant end to the Indian women’s team campaign in the T20 World Cup as India took on Australia on International Women’s Day. They played before a jam-packed MCG grounds in Melbourne. Expectations rose after India stormed into the finals, winning four straight league matches in Group A. The semi-finals against England, was a wash out and catapulted India into the finals. However, a billion hearts broke as India succumbed to a 85-run defeat in a one-sided encounter. 
Yes, it was an anti climax for India, but there were plenty of positive takeaways for the team, feels former Indian skipper and Bengaluru’s Shantha Rangaswamy, also a former National selector for the women’s cricket. 







The veteran cricketer, stresses the need to take an overall view of the Indian performance and not judge by the final game alone. “Our girls could not carry the momentum into the final after such a brilliant display in the league. But, let us give them credit for their overall performance in the tournament. They beat Australia in the opening tie in the league. They could not repeat it in the final, but that is cricket. The Indian performance is sure to make a huge impact on youngsters and I am sure many more girls will now take up the sport in the country,” believes Shantha.
Referring to the final match, she states, “Winning of the toss would have made a difference and there would have been less pressure on our team. By allowing Australia to run up a total of 184, we faced a daunting task of scoring nine runs per over, which in women’s T20 game is a huge task. The team caved in when the top and middle order batting collapsed under pressure.”







Shantha, however, praised the Indian bowlers who were able to restrict rivals and bowl them out while defending a modest total in the league ties. “Our batswomen did not play to their potential, barring Shafali Verma,” feels Shantha. 
The 16-year-old teenage sensation from Haryana, Shafali, was the find of the tournament. She scored 163 runs in five innings with an average of 32. 60. The opener’s explosive start gave India the edge in the league. Praising Shafali for her stunning performance, Shantha said, “She was brilliant and played with maturity beyond her age.” 
Shantha expressed concern about the form of current Indian captain, Harmanpreet Kaur. “I feel Harman’s poor run with the bat has something to do with the pressure of captaincy. She is a free flowing bats-woman and I am surprised she failed to perform. I wish she focuses on her batting and Smriti Mandhana can take care of the captaincy.” 
Shantha was elated with the wide media coverage for the women’s T20 event, especially the electronic media which gave them a prime time coverage. “A massive turnout of 85,000 for the final as reported in the media, is indeed an index of the growing popularity of the women’s game,” observes Shantha. 
Painting a bright future for the game, Shantha is confident that there will be an IPL version for the women’s team too. 
Shantha advocates a good feeder system for the women’s game. “BCCI is rolling out tournaments for Under-16 players and feels more youngsters could take up the game early. “It will create a large number of players and provide a wider base for the sport.” ",other sports
‘Nioh perfect’: Sequel game 'Nioh 2' offers great character builds and fast combat mechanics,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gamespot-nioh-2-team-ninja-sony-interactive/article31082634.ece,"From Software’s Dark Souls and its successors, have carved a bloody little niche for themselves called masocore: games that pride themselves over their brutal difficulty and sell like hot cakes. They also end up taking awards home, like with Sekiro. Showing that people just love punishment. Though, before From Software, Team Ninja was the reigning tough game champ, and with 2017’s Nioh, they proved they still got it and more. Now they are ready to make our fingers ache with Nioh 2.






Screenshot from Nioh 2
 






Nioh is an action adventure set in an alternate history Japan of 1555, overrun by supernatural monsters known as Yokai. Where the first game had a Geralt of Rivia-like protagonist, you now play a mysterious half-human, half-Yokai warrior. 
Truth be told, while Nioh 2 does spin quite a good tale, I frequently found myself lost in feudal lord names. Somehow it still has not quite reached the passive storytelling chops of Dark Souls but does a decent job.
Nioh 2Developer: Team Ninja Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment Price: ₹3999 for PS4
The character creator is mind blowing and gender fluid, with a lot of intricacy packed into creating the character that best represents you. Rather than locking the races down to oriental, you can set your skin colour and race appropriately. 
Nioh’s fighting system is weapons-based, all with own movesets. Your selected weapons, along with magic and your selected yokai spirit, define your character letting you tune and tweak your build as you get more powerful, the more familiar you are with your steel.
The swordplay is fast and furious with a definitive rhythm and flow; there are three stances across two switchable melee and ranged weapons. Managing your Ki is, well, key; this is the stamina drain from combat that can be recouped by pulsing it at the right time. The Yokai throw up constant negative fields, which can only be dispelled with a pulse. It all may seem overwhelming, but there is a beautiful depth.






Screenshot from Nioh 2
 






As with all Souls games, Nioh 2 is tough. Grunts and giant Yokais have brutal one-hit kill moves for insta-kills. You will die a lot, but take dying, not as a sign of failure but as a gameplay mechanic. The new Burst Counter is a great addition to combat, which triggers a Yokai killer move. The timing is critical, you are open to a killer blow if you miss. Yokai attacks are varied, but if you die, you have to run all the way back to reclaim the power from the spot at which you died.
Much like Diablo III, the game throws loot at you, all segregated with appropriate rarity colours. While this may seem like a good thing, most of the drops are non-consequential rolls, making most of your precious gaming time spent at the menu screens, breaking down weapons for materials or selling them. Inventory management is crucial in any game, but Nioh can go overboard sometimes. Though, if you are diligent, you can convert several mediocre weapons into some really good ones.






Screenshot from Nioh 2
 






The levels are mostly picturesque yet deadly. While the levels are not as drab as the first game, they can get quite twisted and labyrinthine. In fact, stopping to admire the beautiful scenery can be fatal. No one in the industry does beauty better than Team Ninja and it reflects in the character models, which almost border on K-pop singer-like aesthetics. Making tweaking your period fashion a lot more fun than your average Souls game.
Nioh 2 feels like what Nioh should have been; it is just more of the same for the fans that love the game, which is not a bad thing. The combat mechanics are fast, and once you master it, they look incredible. The game, highly recommended, is the right amount of challenging, but expect to die a lot.

Data artists and app developers offer new ways of tracking the path of the Coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/data-artists-and-app-developers-offer-new-ways-of-tracking-the-path-of-the-coronavirus/article31082534.ece,"As more people across the country are encouraged to work from home, televised news, social media and online forums combined can either be an enlightening or fear-mongering source of information. 
And with social distancing now a thing, one can only look at their phone or laptop so many times a day for accurate updates about the spread of COVID-19. Fortunately, a few tech companies are looking to make a contribution to eradicate the fake news floating around, using apps backed by data from official health organisations and medical institutes.
Mobile conundrumsAn app, by definition, has to make mobile life easier so it is understandable that an app will not be a go-to for medical data. In fact, do a simple search of COVID-19 on any app store and you may not see promising results. A number of questionable apps flooded into app stores across compatibilities since Coronavirus started making headlines, and many of these apps have been flagged for phishing and other malicious activity. Apple’s App Store and Google Play store moderators are rejecting these apps after doing intense background checks with alerts from suspicious customers. There are, however, developers who want to create helpful apps but they have been rejected as they are not from recognised institutions like governments or hospitals. This is where developers have decided to collaborate with these verified institutions, but need more diversity in providing accurate by-region data internationally.
First, the world saw an app launched on February 8 by NHC, General Office of the State Council and China Electronics Technology Group Corporations (CETC) with support from other government agencies. 
This app’s goal is to help people find their risk of contracting coronavirus referred to as ‘close contact detector’. Users must provide their phone number, name and ID number to check if they were in close contact — being in close distance, without any effective protection, with confirmed, suspected or mild cases when the person was ill or asymptomatic — with an infected patient.
A February 11 article by MIT Technology Review critiques the app, explaining, “Such an app would not be possible without the Chinese government’s pervasive, high-tech surveillance of its citizens. A national video camera network, facial recognition software, and Artificial Intelligence combine to ensure that anonymity is almost impossible, although it is not clear which elements are being used to power the app. In any case, it is unlikely to be controversial in China, where attitudes to privacy and freedom differ to the West’s.” 
However, there is no concrete information on the accessibility of this app to those outside of China.
Shriphani Palakodety, a data scientist and artist based in Palo Alto, California, points out that the data visualisations bred from different corners of the Internet are inspiring, even if the subject matter is harrowing. 
“This time around, a lot of dashboards went up very quickly showing deaths by location, and other instances. Almost all of them use the dataset compiled by Johns Hopkins which they update everyday. Some of the more interesting stuff came after the last Ebola outbreak, especially from the New England Complex Systems Institute. This for instance is where the value of intervention becomes clear — that is for Ebola but you can switch the parameters and it’ll work fine for COVID-19 on a possibly accelerated timeline.” 






A screenshot of the social distancing simulation by The Washington Post published with the story ‘Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially and how to ‘flatten the curve’’ by Harry Stevens  






Shriphani adds that some of the interesting visualisation-animations have come from The Washington Post on March 14 which speaks about social distancing. The simulation sees dots in three colours interacting with each other in certain spaces, charting the changes from good health to infection to treatment, or healthy to sick to recovered. Some simulations, like this one, do not track the progress but do provide perspective on the ripple effect of not socially distancing oneself. 
A highly-recommended interactive visual map is that by the folks at HERE Technologies, who have created a detailed and interactive map of the progressing situation, including the total number of confirmed cases, as well as deaths and recoveries. 
As Shriphani suggested, Johns Hopkins University’s dataset on GitHub was the chosen source. The details are also minute in that you can explore these numbers by country, and in the case of China, by province. 
There is also an app version, according to a blog post dated February 26, which details the development journey of the creation of the interactive map. “Working with live data from different data sources during an evolving virus outbreak meant that we had to adapt and be flexible regarding data collection and processing,” writes Richard Zimmerman. 
He adds, “For the [design of] the map itself we opted for Leaflet and Tangram, powered by the HERE Data Hub and HERE Vector Tile API. To allow users to search for specific places, we used the HERE Geolocation Autocomplete API.” This map features a time slider which helps those who want to know the full path of the virus since day one.

“To provide more frequent data updates for the situation in China, we decided to source data directly from the DXY website every 60 minutes. This process is automated, and the data is merged with what is published by JHU about once a day, and all of this is pushed to the HERE Data Hub to be consumed by our app.”
The visualisation, though, is what makes the data accessible, when there are so many numbers floating around the public sphere. 
The data imagery make big and small data easier for the human brain to understand, and visualisation also makes it easier to detect patterns, trends, and outliers in groups of data. 
“Our map displays data as scaled bubbles, indicating confirmed cases as absolute numbers, rather than normalised values in relation to the population of the place. With absolute counts, choropleth maps are generally not a good option [as it] would have also made it difficult to display data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, requiring a custom solution for that data point. We opted for a linear scale to show an accurate relationship of the absolute numbers on a global scale.”
Unfortunately, the HERE Technologies visualisation is lacking a few more datasets from international medical institutes which could provide case population data for India by state and city.

Another potential data visualisation is by the Prague-based Windy App. Probably the more interesting infographic is the line graph, where three sets of data are shown in three distinctly-coloured lines: Total, Recovered and Deaths, as per OpenStreetMap networks’ datasets. 
Some may glance at the line graph and point out a somewhat positive correlation which is indicated as more resources are pumped into the medical industry for treatment and isolation. This map does not show cases by location nor by age group so this is for those who want a quick overview.",technology
Honor to start selling android smartphone without Google suite from this month ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/honor-to-start-selling-android-smartphone-without-google-suite-from-this-month/article31080683.ece," With uncertainty over supply ban imposed by the US, smartphone maker Honor plans to start selling Android-based mobile phone, Honor 9X Pro, without Google mobile services suite from last week of March in India.
The smartphone will be the first device from Honor’s stable in India that will come with Huawei Mobile Service suite, which the Chinese major is developing with an investment of USD 1 billion to create an alternate of Google apps, Charles Peng, President, Huawei & Honor India Consumer Business Group told PTI. 
“Honor 9X Pro is the first Honor smartphone that will be independent of Google Play store and will feature Huawei AppGallery, one of the world’s top three app stores.We launched the smartphone at a global livestream event last month and are all set to bring the device to India in the month end,” Mr. Peng said. 
 The company claims to have attracted 1 million app developers for Huawei AppGallery. 
 Honor will continue using Android operating system as it is an open source platform and free for any company to use it and develop their operating system by using it as a base. 
 The United States government barred its companies from supplying software and hardware to Huawei in May last year. However, it has been extending temporary licence for supplying restricted products and services to the Chinese telecom gear major. 
 Huawei, along with Honor, commands second position on global level in terms of market share and is next to South Korean technology giant Samsung.
Mr. Peng said that Huawei is in talks with Indian companies as well to bring them on AppGallery and many of the frequently used apps have already come on board. 
 When asked about Honor’s plan to attract users of leading social media apps specially US-based Facebook and Whatsapp, Mr. Peng said most of the third party apps provide an open source for downloading the mobile version and is already available for quick download. 
 Peng said that Honor will prefer to work with Google, however, the company will continue to expand Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) as an alternate option.",technology
Samsung Electronics urges shareholders to use electronic voting for AGM amid coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/samsung-electronics-urges-shareholders-to-use-electronic-voting-for-agm-amid-coronavirus/article31080287.ece," Technology giant Samsung Electronics has adopted electronic voting for the first time ever for this year's annual general meeting (AGM) on March 18, urging shareholders to use it to help curb the spread of coronavirus.
Samsung's AGM is taking place at a convention centre in Suwon, about 30 km (18 miles) south of Seoul, with a capacity of about 3,000 people according to the centre website. Samsung's investor relations website on Monday urged shareholders to take advantage of the chance to vote via the internet up to March 17.
The company conducted a 1-to-50 stock split in 2018, leading to a massive increase in shareholder numbers.
In what is the second-largest outbreak in Asia after China, South Korea reported 74 new coronavirus infections on Monday, bringing the country's total to 8,236.
Reflecting guidance from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, Samsung specifically called for electronic voting by shareholders with symptoms, or who have visited regions with high-risk regions, or who are identified as high-risk such as pregnant women and those aged 65 or above.

Inclusion is the new diversity?,https://www.thehindu.com/society/inclusion-is-the-new-diversity/article31083234.ece,"I once worked with a man from a thinktank — someone who goes to Davos and hobnobs with the biggest names in the development sector. He told this very inappropriate joke at a meeting: A group of three, him included, sat together discussing research work. They realised they were all Christian men, and the only element of diversity they had was that one of them (my colleague) was brown. They joked about having more diversity by including a single black woman, who was lesbian and Jewish. 
I was too shocked to react but that’s the kind of conversation the word diversity leads to. It’s as if you’re doing everyone a favour by putting their names down as a part of the team. Much like in school, where the boys were asked to add two girls to the cricket team, and everyone groaned — the boys at having someone slow their game down, the girls at being talked down to, having decisions made on their behalf, denied a voice, and treated like crap once they were on the field.
Inclusion, on the other hand, is about seeing someone sit on the sidelines and asking them to come join a game, or about a person opting in and getting amalgamated into the team without a song and dance about how different they look or dress. It’s still not ideal, because the person is an ‘outsider’ until accepted, but it has less of a demeaning ring to it. Diversity is ‘allowing’ your son or daughter to marry ‘out of the community’ and then acting like you’ve done everyone a favour; inclusion is believing and saying to them that no matter who they bring home you’re only looking out for the couple’s happiness.
As someone who changed nine schools across 12 years — my father was in a transferable job, I didn’t get thrown out of schools — I was often faced with situations where I knew no one, and felt I stuck out like a sore thumb: I was tall, dark, and spoke in English, and very different from most students in the way I looked and communicated. I don’t remember any school that helped with inclusion, but I do remember that certain students took it upon themselves to help me in whatever way they could — showing me the bathroom, or sharing the time table with me. It is little things that go a long way.
It is this element of reaching out to connect, to support, that is inclusion. Diversity has become a cold word enunciating our differences into otherness. It’s a term used by a bunch of people who sit in privilege, ticking boxes patronisingly. Inclusion builds our resilience, and is a reflection of our emotional health in offering and receiving help; it gives us a chance to expand our being and a chance to belong. Diversity reinforces bias and stereotyping and is a buzzword used by ‘evolved’ HR teams to show how good they are.",society
Chennai’s elderly have somebody to lean on,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennais-elderly-have-somebody-to-lean-on/article31082655.ece,"When author, playwright, novelist and textile researcher Sabita Radhakrishnan decided to launch an NGO for elder care and support in 2013, she was clear about one aspect. Apart from providing geriatric support, she also wanted to spread cheer. “The elderly (over 65 years) population in the city is on the rise, and is largely neglected. As long as they live as couples, they manage, but after one of them departs, they begin to seek support, and the quality of life decreases with their children living and working outside the country,” says Sabita. “Our country is not at all elderly-friendly, be it easy access to buildings or priority to services.”
During her growing-up years in Bangalore, where her father was a medical practitioner, she had always had elders, especially grandparents, stay with the family. “I have such good memories of playing board games, listening to stories. My father believed that if old people had good mental health, it reflected in their physical wellbeing. In his hospital, he also accommodated nurses and matrons whose children simply abandoned them here and migrated to Australia and England. These people lived within the nursing home.” So Sabita was naturally inclined to take up service to elders as an adult.
“I decided to start an NGO to support the elderly population in memory of my daughter who passed away at a young age. But I could not do it all by myself, and started looking out for like-minded people,” says Sabita. She approached the founders of Old is Gold store in Adyar, KP Jayashree and Sanjay Dattatri, and they joined hands. Today, Udhavi has 13 core members and over 40 volunteers.







“The mission of Udhavi is to stave off loneliness,” says Sabita. “The idea that someone has the time to spend with them excites the beneficiaries, most of whom have had full-fledged careers, loving spouses and extended families. With many offspring living outside the country, it does become a great deal for them to even chat with anyone in person,” she says.
Lalitha Ramachander, one of the core group members, says that they encourage volunteers to make house visits and spend time with the beneficiaries — play a game of Scrabble, accompany them to the doctor, collect their outfits from tailor, take then to a movie or a concert, drive them to park or beach, or even chat over a plate of dosa and filter coffee. 
Extracts from Handbook For SilversCooking is therapeutic for both men and women, but do it with assistance.Try to revive your old interests or hobbies. Read the newspaper or listen to the news, and keep yourself up to date.Keep your latest medical files accessible, so that the person who comes over to help you can find it easily.Making homes elderly user friendly is vital, as people over 70 need support.Don’t become a recluse. It can be lonely, and it is easy to sink into depression which could turn clinical and harder to treat. Let people who care about you enter your life.
Says Sudhesh Sharma, another core group member, “As far as possible, we match the profiles and intellectual levels of the beneficiaries and the volunteers so that they spend meaningful time together. We need young volunteers as these seniors say that they feel rejuvenated when a youngster spends quality time with them.”
But the younger ones are not doing it all one. According to Sabita, “Our committed core team at times goes out of their way to provide support and care, even though they themselves are in the 60s. One of our core team members even sends vegetarian food to beneficiaries who miss home-cooked food whenever possible,” says Sabita. She says that even elders who live with their children often feel lonely as they spend the entire day all by themselves. “I want young people to understand what it is to be old and what kind of support is to be provided. We take our parents for granted.” 
Volunteers also teach the elderly to use the Internet, Skype and smartphones. While some of the beneficiaries of Udhavi prefer to get out of their homes with volunteers, some prefer to be in their home environment and chat. A Bengali playwright and a scholar, Sundanda Ghosh, loves to go to Besant Nagar beach and stop for a cup of coffee and snack once in a while, as she has lived in the locality for many decades and the drive brings back pleasant memories. 







Last year, after Dr Sridhar Vaitheswaran was roped in as their consultant psychiatrist, they have started visits to patients identified by him. The core team underwent training in handling mentally ill seniors. “We wanted insights into the life of people with dementia, Alzheimer’s and various other conditions, so that we can understand the challenges and provide necessary support,” Sabita says.
As a policy, Udhavi does not accept any cash donations. They only seek volunteers who can spend their time. Once every quarter, the core team contributes to expenditures incurred. “We utilise these funds to reimburse taxi, entertainment and other expenses incurred by volunteers,” says Kalpana Ramani of the core team.
“We are now trying to focus on elders in the underprivileged section of our society by helping them procure Aadhar card, insurance card and avail Government benefits,” says Sabitha, who has recently published a booklet, Handbook For Silvers, an elaborate set of guidelines for seniors living by themselves.
Another beneficiary is civic activist and long time-resident of Besant Nagar, 93-year old Kamakshi Subramaniyan, well known as Kamakshi Patti among her neighbours. She says, “They usually send two volunteers for hospital visits. I live on my own and manage fairly well, but of late I have felt the need for help with shopping. I simply love to chat away with Udhavi volunteers, and I wish they come more often.” .

Karnataka Ganakala Parishat golden jubilee celebrations held ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/karnataka-ganakala-parishat-golden-jubilee-celebrations-held/article31081875.ece,"The recently concluded golden jubilee celebrations of Karnataka Ganakala Parishat was a one-of-a-kind event where the confluence of Sangitam, Sahityam, Gana Yagnam and ‘anna dasoham’ (distribution of food prasadam) took place with amazing precision for 16 days.
Musicians of national and international repute made the event a shining example of ‘a world unified by music.’
The inaugural day began in the presence of Sri Sri Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami of Veerasimhaasana Maha Sansthan, Suttur Kshetra. The Golden Jubilee celebrations working committee was also announced at the time. 
Five books were released and their authors were also honoured on the occasion. 
With the exception of the inaugural day and the concluding day, each of the 14 days started with a Gana Yagna by musicians led by Dr.R.K.Padmanabha, paying obeisance to Vaggeyakaras, Raga devathas and the chanting of relevant Sanskrit slokas. 
 All the concerts and lecture demonstrations were special in their own way, full of substance and depth. 
 Some vocal and instrumental music concerts included performances by T.S.Satyavathi, Dr. Suma Sudhindra, the Saralaya Sisters, a and many others. 
The exposition, exploration, interpretation, scholarly analysis of music and various aspects of musicology by musicians in their lecture demonstration sessions were fascinating, educative and interesting. 
 Topics such as ‘Tyagaraja’s Kritis on Tulasi’, ‘Violin Vadya Vaibhava’ “ Mridanga Tarang’, and the Tradition of Nagaswara in Temples were covered. 
On the eve of the Ganakala Bhushana, the Gana Kalashri Awards were conferred. Post the Pancharatna Goshti Gayana in the afternoon, the Parishat serenaded all four awardees of Gana Kalabhushana and Gana Kalashri in a decorated chariot.
Presidents of the Senior Musician conference, the Mysore Brothers — Mysore Nagaraj and Dr Mysore Manjunath were conferred with the titles of ‘Ganakala Bhushana,’ while the Presidents of the Junior Musicians conference G Guruprasanna and Giridhar Udupa were conferred with the titles of ‘Ganakala Shri’.",society
Exhibition marks Krishnamurti’s 125th birth anniversary ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/exhibition-marks-krishnamurtis-125th-birth-anniversary/article31081470.ece,"Philosopher, thinker and writer Jiddu Krishnamurti spoke a great deal of words. They were ubiquitous in “The First Step is The Last Step”, the exhibition celebrating Krishnamurti’s 125th birth anniversary by the Krishnamurti Foundation India (KFI) at The Valley School in Kanakapura. His contemplations on life, death, education, fear were hung from trees, woven into installations, run across a staircase and reflected through subtle design elements. 







 At the entrance of the exhibition was a huge tree with suspended ropes holding placards. They had many of his famous quotes: Religion is the transformation and regeneration of man; Desire and thought have made man an instrument of violence, cruel human beings’; Can you end violence immediately, not take time over it? You do so only when you don’t run away from it, suppress it or indulge in it. That is, to remain with the feeling of violence and not introduce any other factor. How Krishnamurti would have reacted to the mind-numbing violence in the name of religion today, I thought to myself. 
 Bengaluru-based designer and dancer Miti Desai had conceptualised and designed the exhibition. It was divided into four parts:Voice, Study, Life and Teachings on education, fear, religion and violence. And the tree was The Voice. At Vasanta Vihar, the headquarters of KFI, in Chennai, Krishnamurti held his talks under the wild Badam tree. 
That’s how Desai conceived the idea. “The Banyan tree was also significant in his life so I hung these ropes symbolising the tree. You sit under it and hear him talk. It’s very experiential. It recreates J Krishnamurti through his voice,” she explains. In the Chennai leg of the exhibition, the same wild Badam tree under which the philosopher sat and gave talks, became The Voice.
 The exhibition drew its title “The First Step is The Last Step” from Krishnamurti’s conversation with Pupul Jayakar, cultural activist-writer and also his biographer. The phrase underlined the perception of the truth by an individual in that very moment. Next moment, a new perception will begin and end. “Visually in my mind, it created architectural shapes. I thought of squares and lines that don’t end.” 
According to KFI: In the past, the focus of the Krishnamurti Foundation India has been the dissemination of Krishnamurti’s teachings through public talks, dialogues and retreats, video screenings and publication of books. After more than 3 decades of his departing, there has come into being a new generation of people who are perhaps not acquainted either with the teacher or his teachings. Therefore, it was felt that the foundation should endeavour to introduce and make available Krishnamurti’s vision of life to a new and wider audience who may find that these timeless teachings are also very contemporary and relevant to their personal lives.







 Born in a Brahmanical household in Madanapalle, Jiddu Krishnamurti went on to become a thinker and spiritual leader who questioned caste, religion and much more. He became part of the Theosophical Society and adopted by Annie Besant. Krishnamurti was groomed to be the New World Teacher but in 1929 he broke away from the movement. He spent his life travelling across the world speaking on subjects like death, fear, education, religion, violence, relationships etc. The section of Life encapsulated Krishnamurti’s journey from his life till death, through his images and noting seminal events in his life. 
It was not easy to put together an exhibition on a figure like him. While KFI curated the text, Desai was tasked with the visualisation. She says it was challenging. “I couldn’t be descriptive. I couldn’t use any symbols. He said there is no horizontal, no vertical and no dimensions. He spoke about the formless. He always spoke about fine intellectual engagement.” 
She focused on creating an experiential exhibition that used a lot of materiality - ropes, bamboo, water, cloth and mirror. The various sections reflected the flow of non-linear thoughts. At the Valley School, the Voice welcomed the viewers and then encouraged them to seamlessly move to the sections of Life and Study. At the Study, the visitors could listen to 21 talks by Krishnamurti on headphones or the sculptural installations in the section of Teachings. 
 The chronology of his travels took the viewers to a long winding quote on Love that ran across a staircase which led them to his teachings on various subjects. In a corner, the subject of violence was evoked through criss-crossing threads with his words emblazoned on the wall, forming the background. 
At the Rajghat Study Centre in Banaras, where the exhibition was first held, the empty wooden frame was hung capturing the Ganga which flows right beside the centre. Here Desai placed it in a way that it captured the lush green environs of the Kanakapura. ",society

Investors’ wealth eroded by ₹7.62 lakh crore, with the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies dropping by ₹7,62,290.23 crore to ₹1,21,63,952.59 crore at the close of trade. 
The 30-share Sensex lost a whopping 2,713.41 points, or 7.96%, to close at 31,390.07. The Sensex has now lost 10,884 points or nearly 26% from its record high of 42,274 touched in January.
The broader Nifty plunged 757.80 points, or 7.61%, to close at 9,197.40. The India VIX index spiked over 14% on Monday.
This was the second biggest single-day fall for the indices, having recorded their worst fall on March 12. More importantly, market participants believe that there still exists uncertainty as to whether the markets have reached their bottom given that concerns around the pandemic are far from over.
“The equity market will bottom out once the infection numbers peak and start to recede... and then bottom-fishing opportunities could open up, but that is possible after clarity emerges in the next few months with respect to an effective cure for the disease or the effectiveness of strong policy actions,” global financial major Credit Suisse said in its latest India strategy report.
Monday saw leading Asian benchmarks such as Nikkei, Hang Seng and Kospi losing heavy ground as the virus outbreak threatens to impact global economic activity.
On the BSE, more than 2,000 stocks declined on Monday, as against only around 411 gainers. Provisional numbers showed that foreign investors were net sellers at ₹3,809 crore on Monday. In the Sensex pack, stocks such as Infosys, Axis Bank, HDFC, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, ITC and IndusInd Bank all lost more than 9% on Monday.",business

 Banks have also been asked to encourage their customers to use digital banking facilities as far as possible.
These entities have been asked to take immediate contingency measures to manage the risks following the impact assessment.
The banking regulator said banks and financial institutions will have to devise strategy and monitoring mechanisms concerning the spread of the disease within the organisation, and should make timely interventions for preventing further spread in case of detection of infected employees, including travel plans and quarantine requirements, as well as avoiding spread of panic among staff.

RBI’s focus on liquidity is correct,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbis-focus-on-liquidity-is-correct/article31085242.ece,"The messaging from the press conference of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das is loud and clear: the central bank has an armoury of weapons and it will not hesitate to deploy them to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The two steps that Mr. Das has outlined now — forex swap and a second long-term repo operation (LTRO) of ₹1 lakh crore — are aimed at supporting liquidity in the market. Market rates may incidentally fall as the LTRO is at the repo rate of 5.15%.
The focus on liquidity is the right thing to do at this point in time. A rate cut, while being a short-term sentiment booster, is not going to help in alleviating the situation as seen by the experience in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve has taken the funds rate to zero, but the markets remain unimpressed.
The situation is clearly an evolving one and prudent action requires that the central bank keep its powder dry simply because we may not have seen the worst yet in terms of the virus impact, both in human and economic terms. In fact, in economic terms, this is just the start of what’s likely to be a long period of instability and falling growth in the global economy. The falling indices and currencies are only a manifestation of the first order impact. The second, and more severe one, will come when major economies either slow down sharply or tip into recession. The disruption caused to commerce, trade and travel already is so immense that the effects on the world economy will be felt for the rest of this calendar year. The effect will multiply if the virus infection curve does not flatten over the next 2-3 weeks.
India cannot remain insulated from global economic turbulence and economic growth is sure to slow down in the coming quarters. In such a situation, it is sensible to hold on to the rate cut option for use at a more challenging time, which is bound to follow. With headline inflation and core inflation — both CPI and WPI — trending south, food prices reducing and fuel prices falling (despite the government appropriating some of the benefit in the form of higher excise duty), the environment is indeed favourable for a rate cut, if the monetary policy committee were to decide on one.
The question is one of timing. The RBI Governor would surely want elbow room in the monetary policy space and not find himself in the position of the Fed or the central banks of other developed countries, where rates have been beaten down to zero or close to zero, leaving no space for action. The focus will be on the next meeting of the monetary policy committee in the first week of April, unless if the situation deteriorates so badly that the RBI is forced to act urgently.",business

IndiGo Airlines, for example, has taken measure to ensure compliance with the best advice from medical authorities and the government. Its ground staff at international terminals have been equipped with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, and shoe covers which are disposed of at regular intervals.
While the crew on all its aircraft are following personal protective measures as well. Crew members aboard international flights wear PPE that is changed every 8 hours.
“And because this disease is most easily transmitted through surfaces, each and every aircraft is cleansed with cleaning agents and disinfectants that are approved by the WHO and Airbus,” Ronojoy Dutta, Chief Executive Officer, IndiGo said in a letter.
Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) of the Tata Group, in light of the current situation, has implemented additional precautionary hygiene measures across its hotels based on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare advisory and guidelines for prevention and transmission.
“This includes training our associates to the protocol prescribed by the Government of India, sanitization of all areas, increased access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers at prominent locations and body temperature checks for everyone visiting our premises using non-invasive laser thermometers,” an IHCL spokesperson said.
As mandated, the company is notifying local authorities on travellers coming from affected countries.

COVID-19 hits all industry verticals ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-hits-all-industry-verticals/article31084983.ece,"India may face a further dip in GST collections as most of the industries such as poultry, sea food, consumer durables and electronics, tour and travel, hospitality, apparel, gems and jewellery etc. are likely to see a significant decline in revenue due to COVID-19 outbreak, as per industry observers.
Cross border trade is also likely to get hit as exports to prominent countries like Europe, U.S. and China will see a decline due to the corona outbreak. For instance, the textile industry, which accounts for 10% of the annual exports, is heading towards a major decline in revenue as supply chain has been disrupted and export orders have been on a drastic decline, as per observations made by Vayana Network, a third party supply chain finance platform.
Ram Iyer, Founder & CEO, Vayana Network, said, ``Supply chain is seriously damaged. Both exports and imports are affected. The corona factor will create serious working capital shortages for corporates and the entire supply chain ecosystem.’’
According to ICRA, demand in the key markets has remained subdued, with impact heightened by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 across regions in the recent weeks.
ICRA expects the Indian apparel exporters to report a moderation in profitability in FY2020, with pressures likely to sustain at least in the near term, and the turnover growth to be subdued, except for a few larger players with an established client base.
Mr. Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA said, ``The Indian apparel exporters are passing through testing times, with several internal and external challenges. The external issues primarily stem from an unfavourable demand-supply scenario.’’
As per ICRA analysis, the industry is also facing challenges like increased bargaining power of buyers amid intense competition, cost-side pressures emanating from disruptions in procurement of materials and consumables such as colours, chemicals, accessories/trims etc, from China.
While demand from the EU has remained weak, recent trends in the U.S. apparel imports have also been discouraging, corroborated by a volumetric decline of about 12% Y-o-Y in apparel imports by the US in Q3 FY2020 and an overall decline of ~0.3% Y-o-Y in 9M FY2020. This follows an about 17% and about 5% Y-o-Y decline in domestic retail sales of clothing and clothing accessories (in value terms) in the U.S. in Q3 FY2020 and 9M FY2020 respectively, ICRA further says.
Trade activity growth had shown a bit of improvement in February 20, largely backed by higher export growth and oil imports, however, trade dynamics are likely to change further in 2020 due to COVID-19, warns Emkay Global Financial Services, in a trade review. ",business

Most airlines may fly into bankruptcy on COVID-19: CAPA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/most-airlines-may-fly-into-bankruptcy-on-covid-19-capa/article31084862.ece,"As of now, 145 countries have been affected by COVID-19 and most airlines in the world will go bankrupt by the end of May 2020 on account of restrictions being put in place to prevent the spread of the virus, said Centre for Aviation (CAPA), a leading aviation consulting group, in a report. 
It said co-ordinated government and industry action is now needed “if a catastrophe is to be avoided.”
“As the impact of COVID-19 and multiple government travel reactions sweep through our world, many airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy, or are at least substantially in breach of debt covenants. Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded and what flights there are, operate much less than half full,” CAPA said.
“Forward bookings are far outweighed by cancellations and each time there is a new government recommendation, it is to discourage flying. 
“Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon,” it added.
Commenting on the Indian scenario Kapil Kaul, CEO and director, CAPA South Asia, said, “The CAPA report is in global context. Depending on the extent of the spread of COVID-19corona virus in India, the impact on Indian airlines with weaker balance sheets will be severe.
“More important, raising funds, if required, may be very challenging. Reducing Goods and Services Tax (GST) on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) may be critically required but this may not be enough to compensate for a sharp demand slump. At this stage, we are now not commenting on the impact in India but it is likely that risks will significantly increase,” Mr. Kaul said. 
As per CAPA, different governments are failing to co-operate with airlines in a bid to make them stay afloat. “At a time, while governments are grappling with the health challenges of COVID-19, it is clear that there is little instinct to act cooperatively. Messages are mixed and frequently quite different. Each nation is adopting the solution that appears best suited to it, right or wrong, without consideration of its neighbours or trading partners,” it said.
When, for example, U.S. President Donald Trump peremptorily announced the effective cancellation of airline access to most Europeans, he didn’t even advise his European government counterparts in advance, let alone consult with them. Other governments have performed little better, CAPA said.
CAPA said the post COVID-19 chaos will offer an opportunity to reframe the foundations of a global airline industry.",business
SIAM moves SC on deadline for BS-IV vehicles ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/siam-moves-sc-on-deadline-for-bs-iv-vehicles/article31084837.ece,"The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers on Monday said it has approached the Supreme Court seeking directions to ensure that sale and registration of BS-IV complaint is allowed till March 31, 2020. 
The move follows circulars from some State governments setting a cut-off date ranging between February 29 and March 25, 2020, for accepting registration applications for BS-IV-compliant vehicles. “SIAM has filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking directions for ensuring that sale and/or registration of BS-IV vehicles is allowed till the cut-off date of March 31, 2020,” the industry body’s president Rajan Wadhera said. 
He added that some State governments have recently issued circulars directing that no applications for registration of BS IV vehicles be accepted on or after a certain date, which are much ahead of March 31, 2020, deadline.
“These circulars have put the customers, dealers and vehicle manufacturers in severe discomfort as each of them are racing against time to exhaust the BS IV stocks which are with the dealers,” he added.

Siddhartha will be concluded and the report released latest by the end of March.
According to a media report, at least $270 million was missing from the company’s accounts.
“It is true that some amount is missing, but the actual figure is different, which will be known soon once the report is released,’’ a top company official told The Hindu.
According to a spokespersion, the promoter family and management are fully cooperating with the investigation but are oblivious to its outcome as their priority is to keep the business running in a challenging environment and meet all stakeholder commitments, including 30,000 jobs associated with the group.

They stepped in assume responsibility of the large and diversified business on the fifth day of the tragedy, while still being in a state of shock.’’

MSMEs will be the biggest casualty of COVID-19 in India: study,https://www.thehindu.com/business/msmes-will-be-the-biggest-casualty-of-covid-19-in-india-study/article31084751.ece,"India currently has over 75 million MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) and close to a quarter of these firms will face closure if the lockdown, induced by Covid-19, goes beyond four weeks while a staggering 43% will shut shop if the panic extends beyond eight weeks, as per a study commissioned by the All India Manufacturer’s Organisation (AIMO).
AIMO on Monday made an urgent plea to the Centre to look into the needs of the MSME sector in the context of the pandemic. 
 K.E.Raghunathan, past president, AIMO who conducted the study, said, “more livelihoods would be lost than lives due to COVID-19. Based on ground impact information gathered from various sources, AIMO believes that a large number of MSMEs in the country will vanish if the panic continued beyond a month.”
MSMEs, that are the back bone of the Indian economy and provide employment to over 114 million people and contribute to more than 30% of the GDP, have gone through most difficult times in the last three years, as per an AIMO statement.
“It is a known fact, that they faced one setback after another, first being demonetisation then followed by glitchy GST implementation, then came economic slowdown of real estate and auto sector to which most of the MSMEs were main sources of suppliers. Then came the financial and banking crisis. Now, COVID-19 which seems to be the final blow to the MSMEs,” added Mr. Raghunathan.
Signs of decline are already visible. MSMEs have already started facing huge financial burden of unpaid salaries (will eventually result in loss of employment), unpaid EMIs ( will impact the balance sheets of financial institutions) and finally, closure of such operations. Loss-making balance sheets does not allow them to get any finance from banks or NBFCs as per RBI norms, resulting in increased unsold inventory pile-up and getting into dead investments and result in huge losses. These and many more issues such as lack of availability of raw materials from China etc. are all leading towards the eventual shutdown, AIMO further said.",business

 Mr. Thakur placed before the House the notifications dated March 13, 2020 seeking to raise special additional excise duty on petrol by ₹2 to ₹8 per litre in case of petrol and to ₹4 per litre litre from ₹2 in case of diesel.
News Analysis | Why oil prices are crashing
 Additionally road and infrastructure cess was raised by ₹1 per litre on petrol and diesel to ₹10.
 Opposition members protested the government move. They questioned the hike in duty when global crude prices have come down significantly. Later in the day, Mr. Thakur also tabled the notifications along with the explanatory memorandum before Rajya Sabha.
 This was opposed by AITC member Sukhendu Sekhar Ray.
 “The price of crude oil has come down substantially in the world market and price of diesel and petrol has been enhanced in our market along with road cess,” Mr. Ray said. 
With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to ₹22.98 per litre and that on diesel to ₹18.83.
 The tax on petrol was ₹9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was ₹3.56 a litre.
 In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by ₹11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped the government to more than double the excise mop up to ₹2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from ₹99,000 crore in 2014-15.
 It cut excise duty by ₹2 in October 2017 and by ₹1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by ₹2 per litre in July 2019.

"Amol Palekar, not the boy-next-door",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/not-the-boy-next-door/article31083874.ece,"After a gap of 25 years, Amol Palekar returned to theatre with Kusur (Mistake), directed and written by his wife Sandhya Gokhale and presented by Rotary Bangalore, Indiranagar. The actor, who won hearts with his roles in films such as Chhoti Si Baat and Golmaal, among others, spoke candidly to the press in Bengaluru, prior to the staging of his play at Chowdaiah Memorial Hall. 
Dressed in a bush shirt, Amol looked every bit the unassuming charmer he used to play on screen. The actor resists labels. “Initially, I used to get disturbed when people said ‘boy-next- door’ because they were not trying to look beyond that. In my first film Rajanigandha, the boy is such an extrovert, but throughout the film he doesn’t say ‘I love you’ even once and yet manages to convey his love to the girl. On the other hand, in Chhoti Si Baat the boy is an opposite. He is an introvert and shy... so shy that he crosses the road when he sees the girl he loves. My character in Bhumika is a despicable villain. In Khamosh, the character commits a cold-blooded murder. If you can’t see the difference between these roles, it is your problem, not mine. I am always in search of the complex.”







Amol says his characters are real and relatable. “I try to make them as non-obtrusive as possible. I don’t want Amol Palekar to be remembered. I want the character to be remembered. People don’t even remember the names of most of my film characters, apart from the famous Ram Prasad and Laxman Prasad (Golmaal).” 
When asked if he thinks about passing down a legacy, Amol says: “I don’t think I have ever thought about that or even tried. Once you are successful in any field, you are expected to repeat that success and therefore keep doing the same thing. If the ‘Angry Man’ image sells then you keep on selling that. I was probably one of those stupid ones who refused to do that, because it did not interest me any more. Once I know I can do this well and what I am doing is also loved by the audience, I lose interest. I want to try out something that I haven’t tried. When I do not know if I will be able to carry it off. There is an inherent risk in failing, which people don’t often take. I have always taken that risk because it makes it exciting and challenging.” 
While comparing Indian cinema of the 70s and 80s to contemporary cinema, is there a tendency to romanticise the past? Amol says there is no-clear cut ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to that. “Parallel cinema in the ‘70s and ‘80s was so vibrant and meaningful that it gave a significant dimension to Indian cinema. It brought regional cinema to the forefront. A film made in Odiya made national headlines, for example. We made Indian cinema proud within our country and abroad.”
Amol has been a vociferous critic of censorship, his speech in 2019 at National Gallery of Modern Art was in fact cut short. When asked about dissent, he says: “When you see a voice being muzzled or a voice of dissent not being liked, isn’t that censorship? Why do we expect only artistes to fight against censorship? Isn’t this our problem, which has come into our homes?” 
As for his comeback to films (his last directorial venture was in 2011, Dhoosar in Marathi), Amol says: “Today, I am primarily a painter (he studied at the Sir JJ School of Arts, Mumbai). I will do 25 performances of my play and that is all. As far as films are concerned, if something different and challenging comes my way, I will certainly do it.
The veteran actor says he would not call it a comeback. “I didn’t leave anything as such. To use a cinematic idiom, certain things are in focus, everything else is out of focus, they remain in the background. So in the visual and performing arts that I dabbled in, I was active. I was fortunate that I was one of the few who was active in all these spaces simultaneously.”",movies
Papam Pasivadu (1972): A fascinating adaptation of South African movie 'Lost in The Desert' ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/directed-by-v-ramachandra-rao-papam-pasivadu-was-a-classic/article31082582.ece,"It was the second Telugu movie to be shot extensively in the deserts of Rajasthan. While the first one, Krishna’s Mosagaallaku Mosagaadu was an action adventure for treasure hunt, Sri Lakshmi Productions, Papam Pasivadu dealt with the escapades of a young boy lost in the desert.
Basking under the commercial success of his 1970 production, Rowdy Rani, a crime thriller, Atluri Purnachandra Rao was on the lookout for a fascinating subject for his next production. The just then released South African movie, Lost in The Desert written, produced and directed by Jamie Hayes (Uys) caught his eye. It is the story of an eight-year-old boy left in the lurch with his pet dog in the Kalahari desert while his father makes desperate attempts to get him back. Sensing a box office kill, Purnachandra Rao commissioned the multi-talented Gollapudi Maruthi Rao to write a story based on the movie.
Retaining the main characters, including the pet dog from Hayes’s story, Gollapudi introduced additional characters, villainy and pumped in loads of sentiment besides thrills in his adaptation.
The story







Venugopala Rao (played by S V Rangarao) and his wife Janaki (Devika) are worried as their only son Gopi (Master Ramu) is diagnosed with tuberculosis and is recommended for treatment in Switzerland by the family doctor (Chittor V Nagaiah). His pilot uncle Pathy (Nagesh) takes him in a chartered plane. On their way, at Thar Desert, Pathy succumbs to heart attack. Gopi and his pet dog Tommy are left in the desert, leading to panicky situations. With the help of an airport official, Chakrapani (Prabhakara Reddy), Venugopala Rao finally locates his son’s whereabouts in a forest near the desert. Even before he reaches there his brother Narasimham (Sathyanarayana) goes to kill Gopi in order to amass his brother’s wealth. However, Gopi is saved and Narasimham dies engulfed by forest fire.
Cast & crew
Gollapudi Maruthi Rao’s intelligent adaptation of Lost in The Desert to suit the tastes of native audience coupled with his taut screenplay greatly helped director V Ramachandra Rao to expand the 90- minute English movie to 139 minutes of exciting entertainment. Gollapudi also penned the crisp dialogues. However, the hero behind the movie was cinematographer M Kannappa. The movie was shot in Eastman colour. Kannappa’s visuals in the desert scenes were a treat to watch. Purnachandra Rao while sharing his unit’s experiences during their 27-day shooting stint in the Thar desert in an article in Vijayachitra said that, “of the 35 unit members there was only actor, Master Ramu and of course the dog.” It indicates that the scenes shot on Nagesh, S V Rangarao, Devika, Prabhakara Reddy and Sathyanarayana were taken in the matching studio sets and on the sands of beaches near Madras. Art director S Krishna Rao needs special mention for bringing in such authenticity and Balu complimented him with crisp editing.
Master Ramu looked every inch a lost child in an unfamiliar territory and won sympathies and admiration from the audience. The cute little Pomeranian named Tommy cornered ‘acting honours’ and won fans as much too. Suryakantham and Chayadevi played relatives of S V Rangarao who were after his wealth.






S V Ranga Rao and Prabhakar Reddy in ‘Papam Pasivadu’  






Sathyam composed the tunes for the songs written by Athreya, C Narayana Reddy and Kosaraju. The popular songs are — Amma choodali ninnu naannani choodaali rendered by P Susheela and the dance-drama enacted by choreographer K S Reddy and Vijayasri, Arey manchi annade kaanaraadu (S P Balasubrahmanyam).
Trivia
Atluri Purnachandra Rao started his career as a theatre operator, then worked as a film representative, line inspector, publicity in charge and as a production manager. His debut production was the folklore, Aggi meeda guggilam followed by Ukku Pidugu (1969) both produced under Navabharath Pictures banner. With Rowdy Rani he launched Sri Lakshmi Productions and tasted big success.
Papam Pasivadu was shot near the villages in Sam Tehsil in Jaisalmer district where the iconic Hindi movies, Love and God and Reshma Aur Shera were filmed. Purnachandra Rao’s unit stayed in tents erected in open spaces outside the villages. Taking a cue from the locals that onion smell keeps the desert snakes away, before going to bed, the unit members would chew onions. The shoot was held in March under scorching sun at 53 degrees Celsius. The unit members travelled to the location on camel back. The shooting was held in two sessions daily between 8-11 in the morning and 4-7 in the evening. Every second day a veterinary doctor came to conduct fitness test for the dog. To protect from exposure to sun, after the day’s shoot, the film was sent to Jaisalmer. In its return trip the car brought groceries and water. The forest scenes were filmed at Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu.







The hyena that chases master Ramu and the dog in the desert was hired from a circus company in Udaipur.
Chukkala Veera Venkata Rambabu better known as Master Ramu hailed from Vijayawada and debuted in Tamil as a child actor with the Sivaji Ganesan-Jayalalitha starrer, Enga Mama (1970) and later acted in Nindu Hrudayaalu. But it was Papam Pasivadu that established him as a child actor.
In a first for Telugu films, publicity pamphlets of the movie were tossed from helicopter in various towns. Released on September 29, 1972, Papam Pasivadu ran for 100 days in 10 centres and the celebrations were held at New Woodlands Hotel, Madras. Nagaiah, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and C Narayana Reddy were the chief guests.",movies

Like other film industries across the globe, Kannada cinema is also facing the wrath of coronavirus and activities have come to a stand still. The film industry and the government will incur a loss of 100 crore because of the virus. For the first time in the 85-year history of Kannada cinema, the government has issued a directive to close cinema theatres. Over 800 screens across the state (including single screens and multiplexes) have suspended screening of films since March 14. As many as 500 workers, artistes and technicians, involved in various parts of film production are badly hit, as shooting of films have been called off. 
“The state’s move to close theatres has been respected by everyone involved keeping public interest in mind. The government has promised to review the situation and take a decision,” says KV Chandrashekar, President Karnataka Film Exhibitors’ Association. The district administration has directed theatre owners not to screen films till March 31.
Besides the film industry, the government will also incur a huge loss on entertainment tax and GST collection, estimated to be around ₹ 70 crore, says Umesh Banakar, Vice-President Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC). “We have convened a meeting of exhibitors on March 17 to compensate the makers of films of Shivarjuna and Naragunda Bandaya, as these films’ screening was suspended because of the government order. We are also requesting UFO and QUBE-digital distribution platform to waive the transmission fee as the screening of these films were cancelled.”
If big budget films were lined up for release at this juncture, the loss would have been greater says a source from the industry. Producers of Vikram Yoganand’s Kushka, Sachin Shetty’s Ondu Shikariya Kathe and Turtu Nirgama have postponed the release of these films. Tarun Sudhir, director of Roberrt had planned to release his film on April 9, but, adds he will again take a call after watching situation.
This is not the first time the Kannada film industry is shut down. Earlier it was brought to a standstill after the abduction of the Kannada icon Dr Rajkumar in July 2001. 
It is the producers who will bear the brunt of this situation. “All others are in the safe zone,” says DK Ramakrishna President Kannada Film Producers’ Association, adding that the total loss for the four films released on March 13 is almost ₹10 crore. The development will have an impact on Roberrt starring Darshan, Yuvarathna with Puneet Rajkumar, Kotigobba-3 starring Sudeep, and Banaras directed by Jayatheertha with the new comers.
Actors such as Shivarajkumar, Puneet Rajkumar, Ragini, Sri Murali, Harshika Poonachcha are focussing their attention on creating awareness among the people about the impact of the virus by sharing precautionary steps people should take to keep this disease at bay. Shivarajkumar asked people to be “at home with the family”.
Puneeth cancelled his birthday celebration scheduled for March 17 saying, “Your safety is the best present for me on this occasion.” 
Meanwhile, Umesh Banakar is planning to make a bilingual film in Kannada and Hindi titled Corona. He has registered the title with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce. 
Shivakumar, who partnered with Umesh Banakar, applied for the registration of Deadly Corona with Mumbai Film Chamber of Commerce. “Title registration Committee of KFCC will meet soon to take a call on registering the title. We are planning to shoot the film in Bengaluru and Mumbai and the process of choosing actors, technicians is on,” says Umesh. ",movies
'Taj Mahal 1989': The poetry and politics of love,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/taj-mahal-1989-the-poetry-and-politics-of-love/article31081794.ece,"“Every person wastes his life trying to become someone. Competitions, IAS, Collector’s residence… he’s always becoming something. There’s nothing called life. The world is living. Life is to be lived, flavorfully. Don’t look at life as a bargain. Experience it and enjoy it.” That isn’t the introduction to Netflix’s Taj Mahal 1989, nor is it the philosophical canoe upon which it travels. It’s a line that Sudhakar Mishra (Danish Husain) tells his friend, Akhtar Baig (Neeraj Kabi), under the cover of semi-darkness. They recently bumped into each other at a poetry recitation after a decade or two, and, now, they can’t seem to let go of each other.
They studied together in college, where Sudhakar bagged a gold medal. However, over the course of time, he ended up becoming a tailor by following in his dad’s footsteps, and, the guy who buried his head in poetry, to earn brownie points from the woman he fell in love with, became a Philosophy professor. You never know how life is going to give you the short end of the stick and this is a great example to show you that the jobs that people take up need not necessarily be a measure of their intellectual capacity — academic or otherwise.







Taj Mahal 1989 zooms in on the lives of almost a dozen people from different age groups. While Sudhakar and Mumtaz (Sheeba Chaddha) live together without getting married since they don’t conform to society’s idea of a sacred union, Sarita (Geetanjali Kulkarni) and Akhtar are on the verge of a nervous breakdown — or midlife crisis — and they’re finding it hard to stay together. Well, at least Sarita is disappointed that her husband is more interested in sharpening his poetic knowledge than getting cozy with her. In a rather straightforward comedy-drama tone, while pouring her heart out, she tells her friend, “Intelligence and romance don’t go together.” Her grouse is that Akhtar makes her feel like a dimwit all the time.
Although I do understand her area of pain, I can’t fathom how their relationship survived for 22 years. She’s a Physics professor, so her forte is far removed from Akhtar’s. Perhaps, the time period this series is set in — the late 80s — is what made their marriage sail through. Again, the 80s setting is merely a rough piece of nostalgia that makes up the living rooms of the characters and not their conversations. The team that has worked on the production design gets the props right, but the costumes are way off the mark. Moreover, for a show set in Lucknow, it’s kind of blasphemous to not have scenes that take you through the chambers of the city.
Then, on the other side is a group of three friends — Rashmi (Anshul Chauhan), Dharam (Paras Priyadarshan), and Angad (Anud Singh Dhaka) — of which two are in a relationship. The tonal shift that makes Dharam pick up a gun to scare off a guy from getting too close to his girlfriend and then somehow getting involved in campus politics is flippantly written. Dharam seems to be a puppet for a right-wing political party and Angad, on the contrary, seems to side with the Communist party. But the questions of caste and religion never come into the picture ever.







By totally eliminating caste from the table, Pushpendra concentrates on the financial statuses alone. A rich Sikh student, aka a capitalist, mugs up lines penned by Angad to woo a woman who reads Marx. Likewise, the lower-middle class couple, Sudhakar and Mumtaz (a vegetable seller), is simply poorer than the teaching duo, Akhtar and Sarita. Maybe Pushpendra wanted to keep Taj Mahal 1989 free from the dark realities of an era gone by. But that’s not an excuse you can buy. 
The series isn’t third-rate by any degree. It just feels plastic and insincere sometimes.",movies

The winners are Aditya Dhar for Hindi film Uri: The Surgical Strike, and Madhu C. Narayanan for Malayalam outing Kumbalangi Nights. Both the filmmakers will receive a cash prize of ₹1,50,000 as well as a memento, during the award ceremony that is scheduled to be held on August 12 in Chennai. The films and directors were selected by a jury comprising of Bharat Bala, Jayendra, Ram Madhvani and Baradwaj Rangan, among 22 nominations in various languages from across the country.
Aditya Dhar, who was a lyricist and dialogue writer earlier, turned filmmaker with Uri that starred Vicky Kaushal, Paresh Rawal and Yami Gautam in lead roles, that was based on the surgical strikes conducted in 2016 by the Indian Army, against militant launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The film was a resounding success across the country commercially.

In a statement, the director said that he felt try blessed to receive the honour, and wanted to thank the esteemed jury and organising team: “I am genuinely humbled. It’s an honour to be sharing this award with an extraordinary talent like Madhu Narayanan. Can’t wait to be in one of my most favourite cities in India, Chennai, for the award ceremony.”
Meanwhile, Madhu C Narayanan’s Kumbalangi Nights was a whimsical drama that revolves around the lives and loves of brothers in a family, and starred an ensemble cast headlined by Fahadh Faasil, Soubin Shahir, Shane Nigam, Sreenath Bhasi and Anna Ben among others. Madhu has also assisted on other acclaimed films such as Maheshinte Prathikaram.

The Malayalam filmmaker said, “Thank you so much for selecting me for the Gollapudi Srinivas National Award for the best Debut Director for 2019. It is a great honour to receive this prestigious National award along with the very talented Aditya Dhar. I thank the jury and I am very excited to be a part of the award ceremony in Chennai.”
The award was established in 1998 to preserve the legacy of Gollapudi Srinivas, a young director, who tragically passed away in an accident during the shoot of his maiden venture in 1992. It is announced annually on March 17 and presented on August 12, every year. The Gollapudi Srinivas National Award promises first-time directors appreciation and recognition of their works on a pan-Indian basis.

 The actor, best known for starring in 2008’s James Bond film Quantum of Solace and 2013’s sci-fi movie Oblivion, took to Instagram on Sunday to share her diagnosis.
 Kurylenko, 40, said she had been ill for “almost a week”. 
“Locked up at home after having tested positive for coronavirus,” she wrote alongside a photo showing a view through a window.
“I’ve actually been ill for almost a week now. Fever and fatigue are my main symptoms. Take care of yourself and do take this seriously!” she added.
 Kurylenko is the latest name from international entertainment industry to have contracted the COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week.

In contrast to the promotional events for Vijay’s previous films, the occasion was restricted to just cast and crew members, keeping in mind the coronavirus scare that is rampant across the country.
Also read: ‘Vaathi Raid’: Third single from Vijay’s ‘Master’ released
Vijay first ascended the stage and broke into an impromptu dance with Shanthanu Bhagyaraj and Anirudh Ravichander.
Beginning his speech with his now-famous ‘”n nenjil kudi irukkum” line, he stated that he was deeply upset that his fans couldn’t be invited to the launch.
“Due to the incidents that happened during the Bigil event (during which some fans were injured) and the safety measures followed (due to the coronavirus spread), we had to do a private event. I am sorry, and thank you as always.”

Praising Anirudh for an excellent score, the actor then revealed he wondered why co-star Vijay Sethupathi agreed to play the villain in Master. “Sethupathi has now become a person who cannot be ignored. I went and asked him myself why he agreed to act in this film, and he shut me down replying, ‘It’s simply because I like you very much.’ Vijay Sethupathi doesn’t just share my name, but has also given space for me in his heart.”
Vijay also returned Sethupathi’s earlier kiss on the sets, with a return smooch to his cheek at the end of the event.






Director Lokesh Kanagaraj
 






 
He also thanked co-producers Jagdish and Lalit and his uncle Xavier Britto who is the main producer of ‘Master’, and then termed director Lokesh Kanagaraj a ‘small wonder’ : “He used to work in a bank and do short films in his free time, and then suddenly came up with such a complicated film like Maanagaram. But it took me time to adapt to his working style. When the Master shoot happened, I realised he didn’t even distribute scene papers during the shoot — I actually got vexed and thought I’ll go home! But thankfully, it all worked out. He doesn’t just have a plan, but a 'Master'plan. Smart work meets hard work, like the song goes: that’s Lokesh for you.”
Moving on to his famous ‘kutti kadhai’ that has become a customary part of every audio launch, Vijay broke into lines his song Elaam Pugazhum from Azhagiya Tamil Magan, and said, “Like the song goes, our life is also like a river. There will be people at different points who light lamps and let it float, those who sprinkle flowers, and also those who throw stones at the water. But just like the river ebbs and moved on, it’s our job to do the same. Kill them with your success, bury them will your smile,” he grinned to rapturous applause.
Also answering a question as to what he would ask his younger self, Vijay replied, “I would ask him if I could get that peaceful life back.. which was without any raids!” 
He also thanked the Tamil people for the support they showed him during the Neyveli shoot of Master when the income tax department halted the film, and then finally addressing his new look for the event — a dapper tux — Vijay stated, “My designer always asks me to try changing my dressing style. Does it suit me? I thought I’ll dress like my friend Ajith for a change!”

Speaking before Vijay, the film’s antagonist, Vijay Sethupathi had thanked Vijay for including the former’s name on the poster too. “It came as a surprise to me actually. After working with him, I asked him why he doesn’t speak so much, and he replied that he prefers to stay quiet and observe others... I learnt something from that. Our vibe was established right from the first photo shoot itself — the comfort zone made a lot of sense to me.”






Vijay Sethupathi confessed he accepted the film because he 'likes Vijay a lot'
 






 
Sethupathi also added that he’d been a fan of Vijay’s ‘cute’ expressions right from the time he was a college student. “When I kissed him at the end of the shoot, I hope he understood how much I loved him. He’s smart and shy; quick, do a close-up of him to see him blush as I say this! It’s the first time a man is making another man blush,” he laughed.
“By the way, you all need to know that I’m the actual hero in Master. If I’m the supposed ‘villain’ to Vijay, then is he not a villain to me? That makes me the hero. Master is a double-hero subject actually,” Sethupathi grinned.
He requested everyone to keep their hearts strong during the coronavirus pandemic: “I want to take this opportunity to thank the incredible work of the medical community. Don’t panic, please. Such problems will keep coming, but we need to stay resolute.”
The 96 star also had one piece of advice for the audience: “Don’t believe those who say they are the defenders of God. God has been around for thousands of years. They don’t need people to defend them. Even if someone is talking up their faith, don’t tell them that your god is better but instead offer them love and brotherhood and humanity. That’s what we can offer as people. Don’t fall for anyone who says they speak for God. Only a human being can save a fellow human being. No one from above is going to come rescue you.”
He signed off revealing that his birth name was Vijay Gurunatha Sethupathi Kalimuthu and that his late father would always remain his ‘master’ in life: “I even get drunk and yelled at my dad’s photo sometimes, asking him where he is now. I love him. He’ll always remain my biggest influence and inspiration.”
Director Lokesh has earlier said in his speech that Master would see another dimension to Vijay. “His character is quite unusual compared to his previous films. A lot of people, including my team thought the title was going to be Vaathi  — we kept the Master name secret from everyone. The three posters released so far also indicate the beginning, interval and climax of the film.”

The likes of Master heroine Malavika Mohanan, producer Xavier Britto, composer Anirudh Ravichander, and other cast and crew members like actors Shanthnu Bhagyaraj, Arjun Das, cinematographer Sathyan Sooryan, action choreographer Stunt Silva, and others also took the stage during the course of the launch, that was interspersed with dance performances, include a surprise act from Vijay’s former co-star Simran.
Anirudh also revealed that the Master album initially had a total of 12 songs, but they had to settle for eight eventually. Two more songs are set to release in the coming days. The composer also thanked fellow music directors Yuvan Shankar and Santhosh Narayan for singing in the film.

In January, the WPI inflation stood at 3.1% and in the year-ago same period it was at 2.93%, as per the data from the commerce and industry ministry.
The WPI inflation for food articles for February 2020 came in at 7.79% as against 11.51% in the previous month.
The rate of price rise for onion and potato too came down to 162.30% and 60.73%, respectively as against 293.37% and 87.84% in January 2020.
Build up inflation rate in the current financial year so far was 1.92% compared to a build up rate of 2.75% in the year-ago period, it added.
In the fuel and power category, wholesale inflation during the month eased to 3.38% while for non-food articles it slowed to 6.82%.
For eggs, meat and fish category, the inflation went up to 6.88% and for manufactured products it was higher at 0.42%.
WPI inflation for LPG gas jumped to 21.85 per cent during the month as against 1.78% in January.
“The considerable decline in the WPI inflation in February 2020 is in line with our forecast, led primarily by food items, as well as a modest contribution of the correction in prices of crude oil and minerals, which would intensify in the ongoing month,” said Aditi Nayar, economist with ICRA.
In contrast, the core-WPI recorded a narrower disinflation in February 2020, which is expected to reverse reflecting the growing impact of the coronavirus outbreak on prices, demand and sentiment, she added.",economy

European stocks and crude oil were both down about 10%. The world’s brightest spot may have been Japan, where the central bank announced more stimulus for the economy, and stocks still lost 2.5%.

That has economists slashing their expectations for upcoming months, and JPMorgan Chase says the U.S. economy may shrink at a 2% annual rate this quarter and 3% in the April-through-June quarter. To many investors, that meets the definition of a recession, and the question is how long it will last.
Strategists at Goldman Sachs say the S&P 500 could drop as low as 2,000 in the middle of the year, which would be a 41% drop from its record set just a month ago, before rallying back to 3,200 at the end of the year.

It also said it also will buy at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities to help calm the Treasury market, which is a bedrock for the world’s financial system and influences stock and bond prices around the world. Trading in the market began to get snarled last week, with traders saying they saw disconcertingly large gaps in prices offered by buyers and sellers.

The Fed action came as major economies expanded travel curbs and closed more public facilities, raising the cost of efforts to contain the outbreak that has infected nearly 170,000 people worldwide. China, where the coronavirus emerged in December, accounts for about half of those, but a dozen other countries have more than 1,000 cases each.

Japan Olympic panel official has coronavirus ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/japan-olympic-panel-official-has-coronavirus/article31093033.ece,"Japan Olympic Committee deputy chief Kozo Tashima said on Tuesday he had contracted coronavirus.
“Today, my test result showed positive for the new coronavirus,” Tashima said in a statement, issued via the Japan Football Association, which he also heads.
“I have a mild fever. Examinations showed a symptom of pneumonia, but I’m fine. I will concentrate on treatment following doctors’ advice,” he said.
Tashima said he had been on a business trip since February 28, first heading to Belfast to attend the annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB).
From March 2, he visited Amsterdam for a Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) meeting to give a presentation on Japan’s bid for the 2023 women’s World Cup.
And On March 3, he attended a general meeting of the same body.
“In Amsterdam and in Europe in early March, the level of nervousness against the novel coronavirus was not the same as now,” he said in the statement. 
“Everyone was still doing hugs, handshakes and bises (cheek kissing).” 
He then travelled to the United States to watch the Japanese women’s team in action and to lobby for the women’s World Cup, before returning home on March 8.
“In the United States, too, the sense of crisis about the novel coronavirus was not as serious as now,” he said.
Staff at the Japan FA have been working from home as a precaution against the virus, but Tashima said he went to the association building several times last week and attended meetings. He began feeling chills and experienced a mild fever from Sunday. He went to a local public health centre on Monday and told them about his travel history.

"No need for ‘drastic decisions, says IOC",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/no-need-for-drastic-decisions-says-ioc/article31092927.ece,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not plan any “drastic” decisions about the Tokyo 2020 Games, saying on Tuesday it remains fully committed to the event being staged in four months’ time despite the global spread of the coronavirus.
Following discussions with international sports federations, the IOC said changes would need to be made to the qualifiers due to the impact of the virus, but it still plans to go ahead with the July 24-Aug 9 Olympics.
“The IOC remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage. Any speculation at this moment would be counter-productive,” it said in a statement.
“The IOC encourages all athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 as best they can,”
Earlier on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Group of Seven leaders had agreed to support a “complete” Olympics, but he dodged questions about whether any of the leaders had brought up the possibility of postponement.
Sports competitions have come to a halt in many parts of the world, wreaking havoc with Olympic qualifier events across 33 sports. The IOC on Monday scrapped any remaining boxing qualifiers due to the virus.
“The health and well-being of all those involved in the preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is our number-one concern,” IOC president Thomas Bach said.
“All measures are being taken to safeguard the safety and interests of athletes, coaches and support teams. We are an Olympic community; we support one another in good times and in difficult times.”
The IOC will hold further talks with National Olympic Committees and athletes’ representatives in the coming days.
So far 57% of the 11,000 athletes have already secured their spots, while for the remaining 43% of places the IOC is working with federations to adapt the qualifying procedures for Tokyo. Qualification could also be based on ranking or historical results as well.
“The IOC has confidence that the many measures being taken by many authorities around the world will help contain the situation of the COVID-19 virus,” the IOC said. ",other sports

The Games that became the ‘Missing Olympics’,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/the-games-that-became-the-missing-olympics/article31092514.ece,"Fears are growing that this year’s Olympics may be postponed or axed because of the coronavirus pandemic but Japan has been here before — the cancelled summer Games of 1940 were also due to be hosted in Tokyo.
Also read: IOC set for crisis talks as fears grow for Tokyo Olympics
Japan’s military aggression in Asia forced the annulment of what became known as the “Missing Olympics” after the Games were switched to Helsinki before finally being scrapped because of World War II.
Tokyo officials originally touted a bid for the 1940 Games as a way to show the city had recovered from the devastating 1923 earthquake, according to author David Goldblatt in his history of the Olympics entitled “The Games”.
In much the same way, Japan has framed the 2020 Olympics as the “Recovery Games” — a chance to show the country is back on its feet after the catastrophic 2011 triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.
Tokyo’s 1940 bid was spearheaded by Jigoro Kano, the founder of modern judo and first Japanese member of the International Olympic Committee, who stressed the importance of bringing the Games to Asia for the first time.

“I carry a grave resolve. The Olympics should naturally come to Japan. If they don’t, the reason for this must be something unjust,” said Kano in his plea to the IOC.
The Japanese had a special reason for wanting to celebrate 1940, as it coincided with the 2,600th year since the enthronement of the nation’s legendary first emperor, Jimmu. Tokyo launched an official bid in 1932 and found themselves up against Rome and Helsinki.
Japan engaged in a fierce lobbying campaign that included pleading with Italy’s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to step aside in their favour.

“In the you-scratch-my-back kind of deal that has become the norm in international sports politics, Mussolini announced with unusual candour, ‘We will waive our claim for 1940 in favour of Japan if Japan will support Italy’s effort to get the XIIIth Olympiad for Rome in 1944,” wrote Goldblatt.
With just Tokyo and Helsinki left standing, the IOC plumped for the Japanese capital by 37 votes to 26.
Before the bid had been tabled, Japan in 1931 invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria and two years later withdrew from the League of Nations — the precursor to the United Nations — after the body refused to sanction the occupation.
The Olympic bid was therefore also an attempt to shore up international diplomacy, according to Asato Ikeda, assistant professor at Fordham University, New York, who has written about the 1940 Games.
Also read: Olympics could be postponed to end of year: Japan minister
Japan’s bid was “part of its international cultural diplomacy in order to ameliorate the relationship with the Western democratic nations, especially Britain and the United States,” Ikeda wrote in an essay in the Asia-Pacific Journal.
As preparations for the Games gathered pace, a schedule was drawn up and posters were printed. The Opening Ceremony was set for September 21, 1940.
There were some hiccups though, including questions about whether the Emperor could declare the Games open, as the Japanese then held him to be semi-divine and therefore unable to be seen and heard by ordinary citizens.
 As diplomatic pressure grew on Japan from outside, there was increasing clamour inside the country for cash to be diverted for military purposes.
Japanese diplomats at the time voiced concern in cables back to Tokyo that powers such as Britain and the United States could boycott the Games over Japan’s war-like activity. Yet, in words familiar to those following the story of the 2020 Games, Tokyo insisted the show would go on.

Barker cites a cable from Tokyo City Hall to the IOC which said: “The citizens of Tokyo are doing their utmost to make the 1940 Games a success.” But the Japanese Olympic Committee eventually bowed to the inevitable and forfeited in July 1938, saying what they euphemistically called “the trouble with China” had made staging the Games impossible.
“The organising committee and the people of Japan were deeply disappointed in having to give up the Games, but, in the circumstances, no other course was open,” the “Olympic News” bulletin published in Tokyo wrote at the time.
“With the worsening international relations and increasing military activities in the Asian continent, the cancellation might not have been that surprising,” Ikeda said.
The Winter Games, due to be held in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, were also scrapped and the war put paid to the proposed rescheduling in the Finnish capital.
The next time the Olympic torch was lit was for London in 1948, four years after the city had originally been due to host. But Japan, as a defeated power, was excluded and Helsinki staged the next summer Games in 1952.
Tokyo finally became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games in 1964.",other sports
Better sleep is better health: Here are the top devices to help you sleep better,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/better-sleep-is-better-health-here-are-the-top-devices-to-help-you-sleep-better/article31090646.ece,"Research shows that one-third of a person’s life is spent sleeping. Much like eating and drinking, sleeping is a basic human need that is important for overall health and well-being.
However, 49% of adults surveyed admit they weren’t satisfied with their sleep, according to Wake Up Call: Global Sleep Satisfaction Trends report. People sleep less than the recommended level of quality sleep per night, the report said. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends seven or more hours of sleep per night for adults aged between 18-64.
Insufficient or poor sleep can worsen memory and make one less productive at work.
To highlight the importance of healthy sleep, the World Sleep Society hosted the 13th World Sleep Day on March 13, 2020. The goal of the society is to advance knowledge about sleep, circadian rhythms, sleep health, and sleep disorders worldwide.
A regular breathing pattern is a key determinant of a good night’s sleep. Persistent disruption of the breathing function leads to sleep apnea, which causes daytime sleepiness and fatigue.
Scientists use medical-grade sensors and equipment to track body movements, brain activity, heart rate and more to monitor sleep. This process is called polysomnography.
Most smartphone apps that track sleep mimic this process, but they do not monitor brain activity.
A common feature in fitness trackers and wearables is the accelerometer, which tracks sleep by interpreting movement as wakefulness and stillness as sleep. It is most effective when paired with a heart-rate monitor as the accelerometer alone can inaccurately interpret a person simply lying down to be asleep.
Some smartphone apps analyse the sound of different movements during various sleep cycles. The apps define fewer movements as deep sleep, and more movement as disturbed or light sleep.
Another way apps track sleep is through optical heart-rate monitoring. Tiny LEDs on fitness bands and wearables shine light on the user’s skin to read blood flow. As the flow changes, the LEDs reflect the it back to the device. This information is coupled with the user’s movement data to build a sleep report. Most wearable use this method to track sleep.
Here are some of the wearables that monitor sleep:
Oura Ring
Packed with infrared LEDs, NFC temperature sensors, a gyroscope and an accelerometer, the Oura ring tracks your body’s pulse, movement and temperature. The device showcases a holistic view of the user’s health.
Oura interprets a flurry of body signals through the night and gives a report on its app. The report captures data on deep sleep, REM sleep, sleep score, latency and sleep stages.
Motiv Ring
The Motiv Ring tracks the complete sleep cycle and gives a detailed report on the quality of sleep. The device also has a three-day battery charge, allowing users to store the health data even when they don’t use their smartphones. The ring syncs with the app when the smartphone is brought near it. Motiv Ring currently ships only to the U.S.
Beddit
Beddit sleep monitor tracks your sleep and work with the Beddit app on the iPhone. It’s a simple sensor strip that can be placed on your bed -- under the sheet or on the mattress. The strip is extremely thin and soft.
It tracks sleep time, heart rate, breathing, room temperature and humidity. If you give the device access to your iPhone’s microphone, it can even track snoring.
The Health app on the iPhone or iPad receives the data from the device. Also, this device is compatible only with iOS.
Fitbit
The Fitbit band tracks light sleep, deep sleep and REM stages using heart rate monitor and motion sensors. It measures time spent in each sleep stage and when the user is awake. It also helps in creating a sleep schedule based on the user’s routine.
Its database of sleep stats helps the user compare their sleep quality to those of the same age and gender.
Urgonight
By far the only wearable that comes closest to the medical-grade sleep analysis in our list of wearables, the Urgonight is a padded headband. It connects to an app that measures EEG. It also uses games to teach the user how to control their brain waves that impact sleep. The device uses neurofeedback therapy to show the user in real-time their brain activity. This feedback is to be used to change behaviour and routine to get a good and healthy sleep.
The device is designed to be used for 20 minutes a day, three days a week.",technology
French anti-trust watchdog slaps $1.2 billion fine on Apple,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/french-anti-trust-watchdog-slaps-12-billion-fine-on-apple/article31089178.ece,"
France’s anti-trust watchdog on Monday slapped Apple with a $1.2 billion fine, saying the tech giant conspired with distributors like Tech Data and Ingram Micro to fix prices of its premium gadgets and limit competition.
The French Competition Authority penalised Apple for being guilty of anti-competitive practices within its distribution network and abuse of economic dependence on its independent resellers “Premium.”
The two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, were also penalised, respectively for 76.1 million euros and 62.9 million euros for one of the cartel practices, the watchdog said in a statement.
Isabelle de Silva, President of the French Competition Authority, declared: “During this case, the Authority deciphered the very specific practices that had been implemented by Apple for the distribution of its products in France (excluding iPhones), such as the iPad.”
First, Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilising the wholesale market for Apple products.
“Secondly, so-called Premium distributors could not risk promoting or lowering prices without risk, which led to an alignment of retail prices between Apple’s integrated distributors and independent Premium distributors,” she commented.
Finally, she added, Apple abused the economic dependence of these Premium distributors on it, by subjecting them to unfair and unfavourable commercial conditions compared to its network of integrated distributors.
In a statement to CNBC, an Apple spokesperson said: “The French Competition Authority’s decision is disheartening. We strongly disagree with them and plan to appeal.”
The $1.2 billion is a record fine for France’s competition authority.
Google was fined $166 million last year for over its anti-advertising practices by the French Competition Authority.",technology

The website, accessible at bing.com/covid, provides up-to-date infection statistics for each country.
The COVID019 Tracker currently lists 168,835 as total confirmed cases, 84,558 active cases, 77,761 recovered cases and 6,516 deaths.
There are at least 3,244 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US and at least 61 deaths.
“Lots of Bing folks worked (from home) this past week to create a mapping and authoritative news resource for COVID19 info,” Michael Schechter, General Manager for Bing Growth and Distribution at Microsoft, was quoted as saying in a ZDNet report on Sunday.
An interactive map allows site visitors to click on the country to see the specific number of cases and related articles from a variety of publishers.
Data is being aggregated from sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Microsoft announced the website two days after US President Donald Trump said Google has begun working on COVID-19-related portal for US citizens.
Google’s website is being built by Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet focused on healthcare services.
“More than 1,700 engineers are currently working on the site”, Trump said during a press briefing last week.
The tool will triage people who are concerned about their COVID-19 risk into testing sites based on guidance from public health officials and test availability.
Initially there was some confusion on Google’s coronavirus portal but the company later announced that it is “partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk, and testing information.”",technology
33% movie-goers say they will stay away from theatres during outbreak,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/33-movie-goers-say-they-will-stay-away-from-theatres-during-outbreak/article31086331.ece,"With cinema halls in Delhi and subsequently Maharashtra downing shutters, watching films should be the last thing on any person’s mind. And 33% of the country’s regular theatre-goers are likely to stay away from theatres till the threat of the novel coronavirus has reduced, a continuing Ormax Media study on the impact of the pandemic on theatre-going behaviour has said.
The survey was conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu industries belt between March 12 and 15. This was an increase from the 23% in the poll conducted between March 6 and 8 and 26% in the one conducted between March 9 and 11.
However, 33% still does not seem that huge a figure given the enormity of the health crisis and the fact that cinema halls are closed. “This is people’s perception,” said Ormax CEO Shailesh Kapoor. “If theatres were open and a film that you wanted to watch was running, would you still stay away because of the threat? The trend is more important than the number. It has grown from 26% to 33% in just four days.”
In the days and weeks to follow, the figure is likely to go up even more. “It's a good measure of public panic levels. So when it stops going up or starts going down, one can say panic levels are also going down. All will depend on how many new cases are diagnosed in India in the next few days,” Mr. Kapoor said. The spike was sharper this time in the Hindi-speaking markets, with 39% saying they will stay away as opposed to 28% in the previous poll, and 26% in the one before that. In the South, too, the rise was substantial — 30% from 21% and 17% respectively. 
Meanwhile, the Mumbai-based Screenwriters Association (SWA) informed its members that offline script registration and the new admissions procedure shall remain closed at the SWA office from March 16 to 31. The SWA’s legal officer won’t be available for appointments either. “In case the situation demands further preventive actions, we shall inform you of the same,” the notice said. The online script registration process on the website shall remain active 24x7. 
The Association of Film and Video Editors, too, has called a halt on all editing and post-production work from March 21.
Leading Bollywood studio, Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions, suspended all administrative and production work until further notice. “We are complying with all the precautionary measures suggested by the government to minimise the risk of exposure to our cast, crew, workers and audience,” it said in a statement, signing off: “We will see you at the movies soon.”",entertainment

Last month, a bunch of art student volunteers had arrived at the otherwise inaccessible campus, with paint cans and brushes. Their aim? To relieve the campus of the often-seen shades of grey and green and inculcate appreciation for the visual medium among people there. Over 8,000 square feet of wall area, will see public art, graffiti work with messages on social awareness by both professional artists and student volunteers in collaboration with Nippon Paints and Thuvakkam, a city-based NGO. 
Though patriotism, aviation, and social awareness seem to be dominant themes, some of the artists have also worked on metaphors that encapsulate the work the IAF does for the country. The latter has always been a running theme. Thuvakkam has been working with the IAF Station in Avadi since last year when they kicked off a tree-plantation drive within the campus. “IAF wanted to create awareness, especially among the local community, through wall art. This will be done in different phases through March,” says Krishna Kumar of Thuvakkam. Nearly 40 to 50 walls will be taken over by the volunteers who have been sought out through an open call. A few art enthusiasts are already registered volunteers with Thuvakkam. “For this initiative, there are specific art-trained volunteers who will sketch the outlines, which will be later filled in by others,” says Krishnakumar adding that each phase expects to see 50 to 80 volunteers and two phases of this scale will be held over the month.

I felt this to be similar to the lives of those in the Forces,” says the artist who is also a member of the NGO. She has also made sure the wall is as colourful as possible. “I wanted to use vibrant colours that also soothe viewers.”

FPI sales at a record high as virus spooks markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fpi-sales-at-a-record-high-as-virus-spooks-markets/article31093126.ece,"Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who have been the prime drivers of every bull run that the Indian capital market has seen till date, have been record sellers during the current month.
Till date in March, FPIs have sold equity and debt cumulatively worth ₹67,306 crore, which is the highest ever witnessed in any single month, as per data from National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL).
Further, while equity has seen the worst-ever monthly outflows of ₹36,217 crore till date in March, debt outflows at ₹31,982 crore is the highest in nearly seven years. In June 2013, FPIs were net sellers at ₹33,135 crore in the debt segment. Incidentally, some of the recent trading sessions have seen foreign investors sell shares or bonds close to $1 billion in a single day on the back of increasing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic that has made investors move away from riskier asset classes.
On March 13, the net selling by FPIs in the equity segment was $910 million. On March 11, the debt segment saw foreign investors’ net sales at almost $1.08 billion.
Similarly, on March 9, when the benchmark Sensex recorded a fall of 1,941.67 points — its biggest single-day fall till then — foreign investors sold shares worth $948 million.
In the current calendar year, FPIs are net sellers at ₹57,379 crore as the first two months of 2020 saw some amount of buying by such investors.
 Market participants, however, believe that with the valuations taking a massive hit on account of the ongoing fall, institutional investors, especially overseas entities, will slow the pace of selling to buy heavily beaten down quality stocks. “We might see some more selling by FPIs, after which there should be buying activity visible,” said Harendra Kumar, MD, institutional equities, Elara Capital.
“There are many good-quality stocks that are available at their book value or even below their book value. Also, crude is at a very low level that benefits India more than many other economies and rupee has performed relatively better than other Asian currencies,” he said.
“So, some of the macros are in favour of FPIs investing in India,” added Mr. Kumar. In 2019, FPIs were net buyers in the equity and debt segments at ₹1.01 lakh crore and ₹25,882 crore, respectively.",business
Yes Bank all set to lift deposit withdrawal cap,https://www.thehindu.com/business/yes-bank-all-set-to-lift-deposit-withdrawal-cap/article31093123.ece,"Private sector lender Yes Bank has assured all its customers they need not worry about their deposits after the moratorium is lifted, as branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) will have adequate cash.
The moratorium, which was imposed on March 5 with deposit withdrawals capped at ₹50,000, will be lifted on Wednesday at 6 p.m. This is the first time in banking history that a moratorium will be lifted from a commercial bank as, in all previous cases, such lenders were merged with other banks.
Watch | Yes Bank crisis explained
“We have taken adequate precautions. All our ATMs are full with cash. All our branches have adequate supply of cash. So, from Yes Bank’s side, there is absolutely no issue on the liquidity front,” said Prashant Kumar, the Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator of the bank. He will take charge as the MD and CEO of the reconstructed bank on March 26, along with a new board. The RBI has assured liquidity support to the bank, if required, after the moratorium is lifted.
Allaying concerns that the depositors will rush to withdraw their deposits after the moratorium is lifted, Mr. Kumar said only a third of the depositors have withdrawn the full amount available during the moratorium period. In the past three days, more money came into Yes Bank compared with the withdrawals, he said.
But Mr. Kumar acknowledged that deposits were his biggest concern.
“We want to build a granular retail deposit franchise and we need to move away from the dependence on bulk deposits,” he said.
As part of the reconstruction plan, the bank has received investments from eight banks, including the State Bank of India, which will be largest shareholder with a 48% stake.
The capital adequacy ratio of the bank, which had dipped below the regulatory requirement, will be addressed by this capital infusion.
“If we take into account the the capital infusion of ₹10,000 crore and written down value of AT1 bonds, then, we are above the regulatory capital requirement,” Mr. Kumar said. The bank would raise more funds before it finalises the annual results, that is, during the first quarter of FY21.
“[As much as] 80% of the funds raised in the next year will be for growth,” he said, adding the bank is also expecting a strong recovery in the next financial year — to the tune of ₹8,500 crore.
Though the revival scheme of Yes Bank mandates that the SBI cannot reduce its stake below 26% in the next three years, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said not even a single Yes Bank share it holds would be sold before the three-year lock-in period ends.
The SBI has appointed two nominees on the board of Yes Bank — Partha Pratim Sengupta, deputy managing director and chief credit officer and J. Swaminathan, deputy managing director, strategy and chief digital officer.
On Tuesday, the Yes Bank stock surged 58% on the BSE to ₹58.65 per share after Moody’s upgraded the bank’s ratings to a ‘positive’ outlook on Monday.",business
"Bike-taxis can create 2 million jobs, generate $4.5 billion in revenue in India: Ola study ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/bike-taxis-can-create-2-million-jobs-generate-45-billion-in-revenue-in-india-ola-study/article31092865.ece,"Bike-Taxis have the potential to create over two millon livelihood opportunities and revenues of $4.5 billion, predicts a study conducted by Ola Mobility Institute (OMI), a policy research and social innovation think-tank of ride-hailing platform, Ola.
As per the study, titled ‘The Power of Two Wheels Bike-Taxi: India’s New Shared Mobility Frontier,’ two-wheelers are primarily a utilitarian choice for Indians, rather than an aspirational or lifestyle choice, and one in three people in the country use them for their daily commute between home and work.
India is the world’s largest two-wheeler (2W) market and 2Ws constitute 81% of the automobiles sold in the country,contributing significantly to the country’s GDP. As per SIAM (2019) data, some 63,000 2Ws are sold in the country every day and for every 1,000 people, there are 102 2Ws here.
“The figures of ownership, usage, and market size of 2Ws truly paint a holistic picture of the ubiquity of 2Ws in India. This asset category has become a symbol of empowerment for the (hitherto) under-represented communities as can be gleaned from its widespread use,’’ said the report.
The study also emphasised the importance of legalising bike-taxi operations in the country, after analysing data from Ola’s bike-taxi operations and interviews with 100 plus drivers affiliated to bike-taxi platforms in Gurugram and Jaipur.
“Bike-taxis are a popular choice of intra-city travel in India’s urban agglomerations as well as the hinterlands. Bike-taxi operations in Gurugram, for instance, witnessed 100% growth in the number of bookings within seven months of launch.’’
Further, with 70-85% of the rides under 7 km in cities of varying sizes, bike-taxis are an effective mode of travel for short distances. The widespread promotion and use of bike-taxis is therefore expected to shift individuals from their private cars with low occupancy to shared mobility such as bike-taxis. This will, thereby, reduce traffic congestion and the need for individualised parking spots all over the city, observed the study.",business
"Coronavirus to hit movement-driven sectors, disrupt supply chains: Moody’s ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/coronavirus-to-hit-movement-driven-sectors-disrupt-supply-chains-moodys/article31089787.ece," Moody’s Investors Service has said that global spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) will significantly slow economic growth, which will in turn amplify its financial impact on several key free movement-driven sectors.
“Sectors reliant on trade and the free movement of people are most exposed, such as passenger airlines, shipping, and lodging and leisure, which includes cruise lines and restaurants,” Vice President - Senior Credit Officer - Benjamin Nelson at Moody’s said in a statement.
Global automakers are also under great pressure because of their reliance on international supply chains, while gaming and non-food retail in certain regions are also exposed to supply chain disruptions, and the inevitable decline in foot traffic.
“Companies’ ability to withstand the effects of the virus will depend on its duration, and we caution that as events unfold very rapidly on a daily basis, our assessment of exposure will change over time,” another Vice President - Senior Credit Officer - at Moody’s Richard Morawetz said.
Moody’s assessment is based on its baseline scenario, which assumes a normalisation of economic activity in the second half of the year, and the ability of some companies to withstand the effects of the virus will depend on its duration.
The agency’s downside scenario factors in a jump in cases and public fear that the virus will not be contained in the first half of 2020, leading to extensive and prolonged travel restrictions and quarantines, along with a prolonged slump in commodity prices.
The number of deaths around the world linked to COVID-19 has topped 7,000, after Italy announced a new surge in fatalities, with over 1,75,000 infections recorded globally so far.
In India, the number of infected cases stood at 125, as per Union Health Ministry log.",business

News that the two-time NBA Finals MVP was among those who had contracted the virus came soon after the Nets confirmed four players had tested positive for COVID-19.
“Four Brooklyn Nets players have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus,” the team said in a statement. “Of the four, one player is exhibiting symptoms while three are asymptomatic.
“All four players are presently isolated and under the care of team physicians.”
The Nets said they were notifying known contacts of the players including those from teams who played against the Nets shortly before the NBA shut down its season indefinitely on March 12.
The last team to play the Nets was the Western Conference-leading Los Angeles Lakers, who were stunned 104-102 by Brooklyn on March 10.
“All players and members of the Nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff,” the Nets said.

How art continues to heal and connect in the time COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/how-art-continues-to-heal-and-connect-in-the-time-covid-19/article31099428.ece,"What is the one thing that never fails to soothe the mind and body during a calamity? It’s not hard to guess. Of course Art. It has once again emerged as a healer and also as a weapon to spread awareness about corona virus that has been causing illness and death across the world.
Dancers and musicians have not only cancelled shows, many of them have also joined hands with authorities in reaching out messages to people on how to cope with the virus.
Vietnamese lyricist Khac Hung’s song ‘Jealous Coronavirus’, based on the V-pop superhit ‘Ghen’ (means jealous in Vietnamese) tells people to wash hands, not touch their faces and avoid large crowds. After the song took Internet by storm, Vietnamese dancer Quang Dang choreographed moves for the hand wash routine in a viral video.
In Italy, which is under heavy lockdown, people have found a way out to beat boredom during self-isolation by singing and making music in the balconies of their houses. Videos posted from Turin, Naples, Siena and more show music is a great way to raise the spirits during tough times.
A widely shared video shows doctors and nurses in Iran, one of the worst hit countries, dancing in protective medical gear to keep patients' morale up, with some of them posting videos of dancing for quarantined patients.
Well-known dancer-choroegrapher Anita Ratnam recently posted a ‘20-second konnakol handwash’ on her Facebook. Aptly illustrated, it starts with TaDiTa as you place your hands under the pipe and ends with ‘Ta’ as you wipe the hands dry.
“We look at art usually from the entertainment point of view, it is during such trying times that we realise its true purpose of connecting souls and bringing succour when little else can. I am a great believer in the power of art. It can inspire, transform, protect and guide. From Tyagaraja to Beethovan, the best works of all great composers and most artistes have emerged out of adversity,” says U.S.-based veena exponent Saraswathi Ranganathan.
While major music and dance events, including The Coechella Valley Music and Arts Festival, held in California, have been postponed, Broadway shows in New York have been cancelled (playbill.com lists 15 plays and musicals you can watch on stage from home). In India, artistes and organisers have called off concerts. Mumbai-based National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in Delhi, Rangashankara in Bengaluru, Ravindra Bharati in Hyderabad and The Music Academy and Hamsadhwani in Chennai have cancelled performances to encourage social distancing.
NCPA, however, has planned to take the performing arts to patrons in the safety of their homes. The social media pages of the organisation will be updated with videos of its popular ‘Meet the Maestro’ series in Indian music, lecture–demonstrations in diverse genres, dance workshops, Symphony Orchestra of India season highlights, etc.

Kathak exponent Aditi Mangaldas’s Drishtikon Dance Company has suspended classes. “We have also stopped online classes since it will require artistes to travel to the studio,” says Aditi.
“Learners can rehearse at home. More importantly, they could use the time to read and find their connect with dance. Most often in the frenzied schedule of classes and performances, we forget to look at aspects that are significant to the art and its practitioner,” she adds.
Writer Jennifer Stahl has come up with a timely story on how to keep your technique sharp from home with a list of online classes. Meanwhile, six star ballet dancers have decided to conduct classes via Instagram and Facebook.

“Dancers are resilient,” says celebrated London-based choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh. “They will exercise, eat well and keep their immune system strong, like everyone else. As for myself, I am not complaining about the lockdown. The lack of pressing deadlines for a change feels good. I hope things will be fine soon as I hope to premiere my next big production in September.”
Saraswathi, who is working with fellow musicians on e-concerts, says that authorities in Chicago are coming up with ways to offer temporary assistance to artistes who have incurred losses due to cancelled performances.
With the most-looked-forward to SXSW (South by Southwest) music festival, held annually in Austin, getting cancelled, organisers have urged music-lovers to support up-and-coming musicians who were supposed to perform by buying their music online and spreading a word about them on social media.
“Audience will get a refund on tickets, it’s the artistes who suffer from cancellations. But we need to be sensitive to this unprecedented situation,” points out dancer Rukmini Vijayakumar, who has now found comfort in yoga.

‘The Test’ review: Amazon Prime docu-series is all about the Australian cricket team’s path to redemption,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/the-test-review-the-amazon-prime-cricket-docu-series-is-all-about-the-australian-teams-path-to-redemption/article31097735.ece,"On the sidelines of the Perth Test of 2018, Australian captain Tim Paine quietly and cheekily admits to head coach Justin Langer in the dressing room that he broke the team protocol by having a dig at his counterpart Virat Kohli. Paine’s instructions to his team-mates prior was to completely ignore the opposing skipper, a very un-Aussie tactic. Yet, something snapped, and Paine now had to watch his every move thereafter to uphold the new team ethic that banter is fine, so long as it doesn’t cross the line into abuse.
That such revealing private conversations are on record, is thanks to the Australian players and management staff agreeing to allow cameras into the sanctum of the dressing room, in their bid to win back their fans. The Test: A New Era for Australia's Team, an eight-part documentary series streaming on Amazon Prime Video, a project sanctioned by Cricket Australia, gives viewers a fly-on-the-wall account (interspersed with one on one interviews with players, coaches, journalists) of the team’s journey from the bruising 2018 'Sandpapergate' ball-tampering scandal in South Africa till they retain the Ashes next year in England.
The Cape Town scandal led to lengthy bans to two giants – Steve Smith and David Warner – a shorter one to rookie batsman Cameron Bancroft, and the resignation of their coach Darren Lehmann. Whether the punishment fit the crime or not is a discussion for another day, but the fact was that in the eyes of the many in the Australian public, including their Prime Minister, the team’s “boorishness and arrogance” (which their former coach Mickey Arthur had written about) had well and truly hit the fan and it was time for urgent course correction.
The image rebuilding exercise brought a new management team in the feisty Langer as head coach and more amiable and down to earth captains in Tim Paine (Tests) and Aaron Finch (limited-overs). Delivering results was only one part of the job. As important was the need to introspect and self-correct.
The Test: A New Era for Australia's TeamDirector: Adrian BrownEpisodes: 8Storyline: A behind the scenes look at how the Australian men’s cricket team fell from grace and was forced to reclaim its title and integrity
For the passionate Langer, it was challenge inheriting a dressing room with a fear of failure mindset, in contrast to the environment during his playing career. In the first series since Sandpapergate, an inexperienced one-day team gets a 5-0 mauling in England and Langer gives the team a tongue-lashing, belting out the F-word every few seconds, like a scene straight out of Good Will Hunting.
Langer’s brand of tough love was met with resistance initially by the outspoken Usman Khawaja, who had issues with the coach’s handling of the nets sessions. Langer admits privately that he respects Khawaja for his frankness. It’s part of the team’s new ethos of 'Elite Honesty', a curious catchphrase which Langer explained as, ""You look a bloke in the eye, tell them the truth and be happy to get some truth back, so that's elite honesty."" After losing the Melbourne Test to India, in a forlorn setting, Khawaja tells the coach, “The boys are a bit intimidated by you, Alf.”
 




 
What makes The Test most compelling is the kind of access director Adrian Brown and his crew were given to go behind closed doors and capture moments of vulnerability and softness. Frustrated batsmen literally let loose by flinging equipment around; Finch finds it ethically wrong to be lecturing his team on scoring more runs while he’s barely getting any himself but the coach tells him it’s okay for a captain to admit he is vulnerable; it’s okay to turn on the waterworks, like when an emotional Nathan Lyon breaks down when handing his close mate Travis Head his Test cap.
Things had gone to such a head for Langer following the series defeat to India that one day over breakfast, he recalled, his wife, broke down seeing the stress he had gone through. The coach himself did a bit of self-correction and learned to let go. He kept emphasising on the mantra of “we” not “me”, stressing on looking out for your mates, putting an arm around the shoulder (the bromance between Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa, of course, taking it to another level).
The most riveting scenes are reserved for The Ashes, thanks to the hostile reception the team received with the reintegration of Smith and Warner. The players grin and bear the hecklers at Edgbaston shouting, “Cheats, cheats” and “We saw you crying on the telly,” without any retaliation, a sign that the team had come far in their image rebuilding.
Yet, it’s hard to miss the irony when Langer later whines about the “booing”. Visiting players have copped an awful lot in Australia – ask Stuart Broad – so the Edgbaston heckling was Australian cricket getting a taste of its own bitter medicine.
England and Ben Stokes’s epic jailbreak at Headingley gets considerable airtime. As Australia commit one brainfade after another with England nine wickets down, Langer lets it rip, kicking a trash can and immediately sheepishly stuffing the rubbish back. The dressing room turns into a morgue, and Paine gives the team an earful for stuffing it up.
That the Australians did, eventually, turn the tables on England with Smith getting a standing ovation, lending a fitting finale to The Test. Yet, it doesn’t clearly reveal what the players felt about the team dynamics changing with the Smith-Warner reintegration. Another puzzling omission was that of Kohli gesturing to boisterous Indian fans at the World Cup to stop abusing Smith. It would have been nice to hear what the Australian camp thought.
Documentaries on Australian cricket in transition have always made for interesting viewing, thanks to the quality of footage available. Rookies, Rebels and Renaissance, on the team’s journey through the 1980s, shows how the team found its feet under captain Allan Border following the exodus of players for different reasons. The Test covers a much shorter period, more importantly, shows Australian cricket culture the mirror, in a step towards departing from the toxic culture that had festered.",entertainment

One of the episodes, going live on March 19, features Priyanka Chopra Jonas, as one of the iconic women redefining what it means to be her.
The 37-year-old will unravel a different side of her journey from being a teenager to the stardom she enjoys today. Snippets of the interview include Priyanka’s nomadic childhood given her father was in the armed forces, her former desire to be an engineer, her experience in the pageant industry leading up to Miss World, her transition to the U.S., and finding a medium between the two cultures. 
Having played a five-time boxing champion in Mary Kom, Priyanka says, “My work has been the greatest rock in my life. It’s like a plant – if you keep feeding it, it becomes a tree and gives you shadow. My work has been that.” This is what continues to inspire her as she plans to develop movies, based on true stories, featuring real life women on the helm. She also explains,“I want to be able I want to be able to have the part of the world or an audience of the world that may not know my work get introduced to me as an artist. And I'm hoping that will happen in the next few years. And I also want to taste motherhood. I want to be able to do both.”
The seven-episode series, features powerful women from different backgrounds and countries, in conversation with the designer, on their greatest successes and most challenging lessons. The celebrity guests include Kris Jenner, Elaine Welteroth, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, among many more. The podcast launched on the streaming service on March 12 in celebration of Women’s History Month.







In an interview with Spotify ahead of the podcast launch, Diane details the mission behind the podcast, “I always mentioned the words ‘in charge’ when I was growing up. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew the kind of woman that I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was a woman in charge. And now, the reason I give for being in fashion is basically to dress the woman in charge or to help her to feel in charge, to give her confidence. I think it’s important that when you have a voice, you use that voice, plus your knowledge, experience, and connections, in order to help others to have a voice and to be in charge.”

That’s why I said the secret of life is owning it. Most of them had very different lives and everything, but how they dealt with the challenges and the strength and the courage is very similar, and that’s what [the podcast] is about.”",entertainment

Siddharth Roy Kapur, president of the guild, said the total halt of all production-related activity in the foreseeable future is bound to have a significant impact on the lives and livelihoods of daily-wage earners in the industry.
“We would encourage the entire film fraternity to contribute to the fund to ensure that we can do all we can to minimise the disruption in the lives of our valued colleagues and associates in this difficult time,” he said, in a statement.
Earlier, in the wake of the lockdown, leading filmmakers had expressed concern about life ahead for the daily-wage earners who are the most affected by the decision, just as they were crippled during demonetisation in 2016.

Coronavirus | Tips for parents working from home to keep their children engaged,https://www.thehindu.com/society/home-not-alone/article31098803.ece,"“There is a dark cloud over us,” says toy-innovator and science expert Arvind Gupta. The 67-year-old, who has made science fun for millions of children across the world through his ‘toys from trash’, says that there “is a silver lining” to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As people opt for working from home, this is a golden opportunity for families to bond; parents and children can work on exciting projects together, discover what they always wanted to, but never got the opportunity to do.” Arvind says that the Internet is a good place to start. “There is a lot of junk out there on the Web,” he warns. “But it also has some great resources.”
Among them, is his website, arvindguptatoys.com that has over 4,000 videos on making science toys from everyday objects such as old CDs, rubber bands, straws, and PET bottles. They are available in 18 languages; there are books to download as well, and all of the above can be accessed for free.






Make the most of it Try your hand at gardening, household chores or create something new
 






With schools shutting down, and adults being advised to work from home, it is only natural that parents are at their wit’s end. How does one keep children engaged in something worth their while, keeping gadgets at bay?
Homeschooling parents share their notes. Chennai-based mother of three Deepa Packiyanath, who is home-schooling her 16-year-old daughter, says that they go on small walks around the neighbourhood. “We play UNO and board-games and also try our hand at some Zentangle; it can be relaxing.”
Deepa says that since the teen years can be tricky, what with their mood swings, she prefers to tailor the day around her daughter’s moods. “I sometimes pick a subject she is studying that day, say psychology, and keep all our conversations around it,” she adds.
She feels that keeping children completely off gadgets might be difficult. “I cannot restrict them entirely. Just the other day, their gang was making plans to play a game online together,” she says.
Parents of toddlers and young children need not look elsewhere for resources. “Involve them in age-appropriate everyday household activities,” says Madhu Karthik, mother of one, and founder of Lila Learning Space in Erode. “We can encourage them to chop vegetables with us, peel onions and boiled potatoes; and when we cook, we can teach them about the various flavours as we add the masalas into the dish,” she adds.
Even washing clothes can be made into a fun activity. And children love water. “Older children can help dry clothes; they can place pegs on the line with a parent to guide them,” says Madhu. It does parents good to invest in some open-ended toys such as blocks. “Children can play with them in multiple ways,” she adds. This is also a good time to stock up on art supplies. “We can come up with a theme a day. For instance, we can ask them to paint one animal each day for some variety.” This, she feels, will keep children occupied for at least an hour.
Madhu says with some soil, an empty coconut shell, and a handful of coriander seeds, children can be shown the joys of growing something on their own. Simply throw in a few seeds into an arrangement of soil inside the shell, encourage the child to sprinkle some water in it once in a while. “Imagine their excitement when they see it sprout and grow!” she smiles. “They will be hooked. Even after schools start, this exercise can continue. Tomatoes and chillies are easy to grow at home.”
R Senbaga Poonguzhali, a Coimbatore-based homeschooling mother, speaks to us over phone amid the din of children chattering around her. Poonguzhali says that while parents can bond with their children over even mundane tasks such as cleaning shelves at home or folding clothes, she prefers to just “let them be”.
“As adults, it can be difficult to keep playing with them,” she feels. And if left alone, children come up with their own games. “They come up with stories, characters...they approach me when they run out of ideas and I only gently suggest something. They take off from there.”
As Madhu puts it, “It is okay to get bored. Boredom is not a bad thing,” she feels. “It always leads to something creative.”
Expert speakEarly childhood education expert Padma Srinath, who has five decades of experience and is a consultant at Adyar Theosophical Academy, says she feels that this period could be well utilised by parents and children to enhance their knowledge and build relationships.Children can collect twigs and dry leaves from gardens and construct animal figurines, taking help from online tutorials.Singing can stimulate the lungs. Apart from this, kids can be taught breathing exercises such as pranayama and this could be done as a family.Let children draw kolam patterns on the floor every morning and evening. It is a great exercise for mindfulness and helps improve focus.Children must be introduced to the concept of sustainability. Parents could give them the task of making something useful out of waste they find within the house. For example, mats or rugs can be made out of old saris or dupattas. These can then be donated to organisations such as Blue Cross where animals are in need of such soft mats.(As told to Chitradeepa Anantharam)",society

BoM spots opportunity in COVID-19 crisis,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bom-spots-opportunity-in-covid-19-crisis/article31101930.ece,"The state-run Bank of Maharashtra has sensed a business opportunity in the COVID-19 outbreak. It has issued a circular to all its branches and offices asking staff to beef up sales of health insurance products since such products are in demand now following the outbreak of the virus. 
The circular, which has been reviewed by The Hindu, says the bank’s performance in selling life and non-life insurance products has been disappointing.
“The performance of the bank under this campaign is nowhere near expectations in both ‘life insurance campaign’ and ‘non-life insurance campaign’, which is very disappointing. To give a push to the campaign, it is decided to observe a dedicated four days (March 18-21, 2020) drive for health insurance,” the communication said. “Looking at the risk of the pandemic COVID-19, awareness and demand for health insurance have increased. This is the time for us to use this as a business opportunity and help our customers by offering suitable health insurance products,” the circular reads.
The Pune-based bank acts as an agent for insurance companies such as United India Insurance, Future Generali and ManipalCigna. 
However, the directive has not gone down well with its staff. “It is shocking to observe that when the entire nation is struggling with this medical emergency as a national disaster, Bank of Maharashtra administration is looking at it as a business opportunity,” said Devidas Tuljapurkar, general secretary, All India Bank Of Maharashtra Employees Federation.
“Bank employees with great difficulty and risk are attending the bank and asking them to fulfill the target for health insurance is inhuman and asking customers to purchase those policies is cruel,” he said, demanding the circular be withdrawn.",business

The move comes after the banking regulator allowed Kotak Mahindra Bank promoters to reduce their stake to 26%. The RBI norms had earlier capped promoter stake at 15%. 
“... the promoter has sought RBI approval to increase shareholding to 26% and they await further guidance from the regulator,” the bank said.
The promoter has informed the exchanges about the simultaneous release of non-disposal undertaking with the creation of a pledge in relation to 23.8 million shares of the bank. 
“No new borrowing was undertaken and was merely a formalisation of a three-year old arrangement. The money was originally raised to make an overseas acquisition which did not fructify — the pledge is a small fraction of the promoter holding in the bank,” the statement said.
The bank also said a couple of State government entities have made withdrawals amounting to less than 2% of the total deposits.
“We are engaging with them to reiterate the stance of the regulator that the government deposits in all private sector banks are safe,” it said. The moratorium on Yes Bank has led to some State governments withdrawing deposits from private banks. Another private lender, RBL Bank, also had a similar experience. 
 The statement from the Hindujas comes amid the bank’s stock coming under heavy selling pressure. IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack on Wednesday. 
The stock lost nearly 24%, or ₹144.45, to close at ₹459.85 on the BSE. Earlier in the day, it fell to a 52-week low of ₹382.55, or nearly 37% lower compared with Tuesday’s close of ₹604.30.
In the last one month, shares of IndusInd Bank had fallen almost 60%, as the stock had closed at ₹1,144.15 on February 18.
In the statement, the bank tried to ally investors’ concerns regarding asset quality.
“...[the] bank is financially strong, well-capitalised, profitable, and a growing entity with strong governance,” it said.
On asset quality, the bank said its gross NPA ratio, which was 2.18%, was the second lowest in the industry amongst large private sector banks and the figures were expected to be pretty much in line with those of the last quarter. It expects net NPA ratio of 1.05% as at the last quarter to fall below 1%, which is in line with the aim to take provision cover beyond 60%. ",business

Steven Spielberg: ‘West Side Story was one haunting temptation I finally gave in to’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/steven-spielberg-west-side-story-was-one-haunting-temptation-i-finally-gave-in-to/article31100755.ece,"Filmmaker Steven Spielberg says that he wanted to make a film on the battle against xenophobia and racial prejudice.
That’s the reason he decided to reimagine the musical West Side Story for the big screen. 
“West Side Story was actually the first piece of popular music our family ever allowed into the home. I absconded with it —this was the cast album from the 1957 Broadway musical —and just fell completely in love with it as a kid. West Side Story has been that one haunting temptation that I have finally given in to,” Spielberg told Vanity Fair.
The classic New York tale tells the story of two lovers: Maria, a Puerto Rican, whose brother Bernardo is the leader of the “Sharks” street gang and Tony, a former leader of “The Jets”, who battled The Sharks.
Maria will be played by Rachel Zegler, while Baby Driver actor Ansel Elgort will star as Tony. The first looks of the 20th Century Studios distributed film were released recently.
The film, slated to release in December, is both a romance and a crime story. It is a story of street gangs, racism, and violence in the shadows of rising skyscrapers. 
“This story is not only a product of its time, but that time has returned, and it’s returned with a kind of social fury,” Spielberg said, adding: “I really wanted to tell that Puerto Rican, Nuyorican experience of basically the migration to this country and the struggle to make a living, and to have children, and to battle against the obstacles of xenophobia and racial prejudice.”",movies
Kay Kay Menon on playing a RAW officer in Neeraj Pandey’s ‘Special Ops’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kay-kay-menon-on-playing-a-raw-officer-in-neeraj-pandeys-special-ops/article31099185.ece,"Tense SUV rides through the subcontinent’s crowded old cities, photographs of dead men who stare back from cork boards in operation rooms, War Room briefings, the hunt for the mastermind... spy dramas are tumbling out of the web series shelf like never before.
The latest to release is Hotstar Special and Friday Storytellers’ Special Ops — the story of a 19-year hunt for the man behind the biggest terror attacks on India — co-directed by Neeraj Pandey and Shivam Nair. The eight-episode series spans 12 countries, six agents and the terrorist behind the 2001 attack on Parliament, the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and other blasts in Kashmir. 
Pandey says for the first time in the history of Indian entertainment, the Parliament attack has been recreated on celluloid, a sequence with a relentless drumbeat of tension with which the web series opened on March 17.
The manhunt is mounted on a large scale and was shot across numerous countries such as Turkey, Azerbaijan, Jordan and India, and is showcased through an ensemble cast, including Kay Kay Menon, Divya Dutta, Vinay Pathak, Karan Tacker, Sajjad Delafrooz, Sana Khaan, Saiyami Kher, Meher Vij, Vipul Gupta and Muzammil Ibrahim. 
 But the weight of the mission to nail India’s Public Enemy No.1 falls on Himmat Singh, senior analyst and logistics head at the Research and Analysis Wing, portrayed by the lean and dapper Kay Kay Menon. The 53-year-old film, stage and television veteran known for his stellar roles in Sarkar, Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, Baby, Black Friday and Shaurya, shot close to two months for the web series. 
In answer to how he prepared for a role that is lived out in the shadows of the modern world, Menon, in a telephone interview, says, “I invest a lot in the text and discussions with the writer and director as it is ultimately their vision. And then I work within the parameters instead of bringing in external research. What I deliver becomes an intensely distilled product. There are finite roles, but people are infinite. I play the person and not the role. I’m interested in Himmat Singh and not the RAW agent he is. Cinema is to do with people and their inter-relationships on screen.” 
Written by Pandey, Deepak Kingrani and Benazir Ali Fida, the storyline is a result of years of research on the ways of Indian intelligence agencies. “As the demographic is different, I did not watch the glut of series on the CIA or KGB. I’m sceptical about meeting people whose work may have inspired the story. I rather have a third person’s point of view. Neeraj has met many of them. I prefer to go with his take, to avoid what I call, mannerism marketing which can be stifling. Unless, it’s a historical plot which calls for some research, I believe all cinema is necessarily fiction,” says Menon.
“Undercover agents are the unsung heroes of our time,” adds Menon. “They appear to lead normal lives but are constantly protecting the nation from threats. Special Ops tries to bring forth the lives of these agents.”
The web series, available in seven languages, follows the now-familiar style of contemporary action thrillers that tells you in which timeline and where in the world the story is unfolding. Menon’s character is situated in India but he deploys a team of remarkably skilled agents, men and women, across the globe. Himmat Singh has brains, brawn and, at most times, a Scout’s moral code but the action is left to the agents on the field. 
“I love action because I’m a sportsperson, but my role is one of a serious man at the helm. It comes through my emotional valency. The actor in me had to look at that... although I would’ve loved to jump off a cliff,” says Menon. “I approached the role with positivity. It’s 60 days of my life that’ll never return, so it needs to be engaging. After it’s done, I’m dispassionate about it.” 
On having traversed the theatre-television-film format before arriving at the web series door, Menon says, “I don’t act less because its television or more because its cinema. The web series genre lies comfortably in the middle; allows enough time to juice out the character. All tools are sacrosanct; it depends on who is using it. I blank myself as far as the media is concerned. The medium for me is the camera.”

The difference? Everything is unscripted.
“We come from a background of providing 25 years of factual entertainment, and our content is hugely valued by our loyal audience. In the recent past, we have also focused on localisation, and now our programs are present in several regional languages as well. While the television network continues to be in demand, why enter the OTT space now? We realised that over 40-odd streaming websites existed, but they all provided only scripted entertainment. At the most, some had a few shows that cater to the unscripted segment, but there was no dedicated platform,” explains Megha Tata, Managing Director – South Asia, Discovery.






The Discovery Plus app has been formulated to allow easy discoverability of content
 






The app launched earlier this week with an introductory offer of INR 299 per year, and has been curated specifically for India. Offerings include marquee programs from Discovery’s massive library of content such as Bear Grylls (Running Wild with Bear Grylls, Man vs Wild), Josh Gates (Expedition Unknown); kid-friendly shows like Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman, Crikey! It’s The Irwins, Kids Baking Championship; blue-chip documentaries and specials like Racing Extinction, First In Human, India Emerges: A Visual History, and all-time favorites like Body Hack, Say Yes to the Dress, American Chopper, Deadliest Catch and more.
“Our content is replenished every year, and the aim is for it to reach the tier 1 and tier 2 cities as well, where consumption on OTT platforms are increasing too,” adds Megha.

The Discovery Plus app is instantly pleasing to the eye, and the easy-to-use and accessibility features indicate the level of design and insight that has gone into its making. Says Issac John, Business Head – Digital (South Asia), Discovery, “The app has been formulated to allow discoverability of content, as nobody has the time to go wade through hours of shows. We have features such as ‘#MindBlown’, which is a curated destination featuring learning focused collections of kids-friendly science and wildlife content, and ‘Shorts’ that will feature hundreds of free short-form videos that will satisfy the emerging Indian mobile user looking for infotainment on the go.”

The offerings are spread across 40-plus genres, including Science, Adventure, Food and Lifestyle, in 8 languages including Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali and Marathi. The content will be curated from brands such as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, BBC, TLC, Discovery Science, Discovery Turbo, ID, Food Network, HGTV, Cooking Channel, Travel Channel, DIY Network, Motortrend and VICE.

Issac also says, “We put in about two months of user research, another two-and-half-months to design the architecture, and then another eight solid months of coding before we finalised the app. We also didn’t want the price point to be a barrier for the Indian user, and came up with a figure that is really economical and among the cheapest when we compare it to other platforms.”
The line-up for Discovery Plus’ premium content across all key genres includes their much-anticipated Into the Wild with Rajnikanth, Coronavirus: The Silent Killer, Mythbusters, Wild Karnataka and Project Runway among others.
In fact, Rajinikanth’s TV debut show will be launched first on Discovery Plus at 6:00 am on March 23 much before the television premiere which is at 8:00 pm. Discovery Plus will also have exclusive videos including Behind The Scenes for the Superstar’s fans.






 
“After the unprecedented response to PM Narendra Modi’s episode with Bear Grylls, we were looking for other big names to participate in this adventure. We had a lot of actors who were interested and approached us, in fact. But then we reached out to Kavithalaya for the opportunity to collaborate with Rajinikanth sir for an episode with Bear Grylls, and once they agreed, it was a no brainer,” smiles Megha.
“Rajinikanth sir agreed to the proposal immediately, and he was as excited as us to make his television debut after 43 years in the industry. What an absolute trooper he was! The episode will speak volumes about his commitment to his craft of entertaining people, and it truly will feature him in a never-before-seen avatar,” they sign off.
Discovery Plus is also launching with one-of-a-kind rewards with mobile payments app, Google Pay.  Google Pay users who tune-in to the premiere of Into the Wild with Bear Grylls featuring Rajinikanth on March 23 at 8:00 PM on Discovery, can match  the audio for the first four minutes of the show or the promos leading up to the show with Google Pay’s ‘On-Air’ feature, and get a reward upto 100% off on Discovery Plus annual  subscription price.",movies
"Sobhita Dhulipala on ‘Made in Heaven’ Season 2, working across industries and ‘Ponniyin Selvan’",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sobhita-dhulipala-on-made-in-heaven-season-2-working-across-industries-and-ponniyin-selvan/article31098928.ece,"Has anyone had a better 2019 than Sobhita Dhulipala? The pan-Indian star absolutely owned the web-series space with two big-budget shows — Made in Heaven on Amazon Prime (now renewed for a second season) and Bard of Blood on Netflix — both of which endeared her to audiences, and put her on level pegging with the likes of Radhika Apte as the queen of OTT platforms in India.
She followed that up with a brutally raw act in Geetu Mohandas’ Moothon, and while her role in Jeethu Joseph’s Bollywood outing The Body may not have added much to her repertoire, her performance in Ghost Stories at the beginning of 2020 came for much appreciation.
It gets better; the 26-year-old has also been roped in to star in director Sashi Kiran’s Major, which marks Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu’s debut as producer and is inspired by 26/11 martyr, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan.
And the icing on the cake: Sobhita will soon join the cast of Mani Ratnam’s magnus opus Ponniyin Selvan, which is based on the classic novel about the life of Raja Raja Chozhan I, by Kalki Krishnamurthy. Though Sobhita’s role in the project hasn’t been revealed yet, she will join the ensemble cast of A-listers that include Vikram, Jayam Ravi, Karthi, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Trisha to name a few.
Talking to The Hindu, here’s the star’s take on how 2020 will pan out for her. Excerpts from an interview:
Was it always your goal to become a pan-Indian actor and balance industries?
I have always been passionate about telling stories and belonging in many worlds; it is my curiosity about human behaviour and situations that guides me in choosing projects. I have clarity that language is a tool, not a medium.
What can you tell us about your role in ‘Ponniyin Selvan’?
Kindly allow me the joy of official announcements? My lips are sealed on this matter for now!
Okay, but do you follow the Tamil movie industry? Any other actors or directors you’d like to work with in the future?
I do, wonderful stories are told in Tamil cinema which is populated with brilliant actors and directors, I would be delighted to work with Vetrimaran, Thiagarajan Kumararaja, Bala, karthik Subbaraj, Ram, Shankar, Sasi Kumar, Ameer Sultan, Gautham Menon... the list goes on!
What will Tara’s arc be like this time around in the second season of ‘Made in Heaven’?






Kalki Koechlin and Sobhita in ‘Made in Heaven’
 






Can’t let the cat out of the bag yet! Season 2 will be out roughly around the start of 2021, we begin filming in about a month, it’s an exuberant yet sensitively narrated project that has been well-received and the team is motivated to further it with as much effect as eloquence.
Considering you feature heavily in both spaces, is there a difference between working on a web-series for a platform like Netflix/ Prime and shooting for a movie?
I don’t think so, no, my work as an actor remains the same irrespective of the platform. What may be different is perhaps the amount of time that is allotted to detail a character. In my experience, a series allows for silence in it’s screenplay and that often speaks the most: a luxury that film can not afford much.
Since you’re working across industries, how do you internalise or prepare for a character if it’s a film in a language you aren’t fluent in?
It has been a very insightful experience to be able to understand emotions without the attachment of words and then to combine them in expression. This deconstruction has made me much more focused and present; I love the discipline.
I don’t see roles as tough or easy, but consuming and liberating, yes. Most of all, they have been enriching. They make my empathy steeper.
You’re popular on social media for your personality: what do you do outside work? Do you see an alternate career outside films?
I haven’t thought about alternate careers, to be frank, I have been a bookworm since school and indulge in reading a lot, I occasionally write, I enjoy travelling when I can.
I don’t know about popularity, but I do know that I am very much my own person, and wear my heart on my sleeve, no matter how inconvenient… whether on social media or in real life.
A sneak-peek into what 2020 looks like for you?

The Tamil and Telugu film industries, which account for a sizeable chunk of box-office revenues annually, have witnessed the postponing of film releases and shooting, with artistes, filmmakers and technicians ensuring caution over commerce.
Theatres are shut, and films will release only after the situation is calmer. Among films that have been directly hit is Mohan Krishna Indraganti’s film V, starring Nani, Sudheer Babu, Nivetha Thomas and Aditi Rao Hydari, which was set to hit the screens on March 25. The makers will now announce have to announce a new release date.
Hemanth Madhukar’s Nishabdham, starring Anushka Shetty and Madhavan is another film that has been pushed. Rana Daggubati’s ambitious jungle adventure, which was to release as Kaadan in Tamil and Aranya in Telugu was scheduled to open on April 2. The film, which also had a Hindi version titled Haathi Mere Saathi, now stands postponed indefinitely.
Shooting schedules have been badly hit, too. Naga Chaitanya’s Love Story as well as his father Nagarjuna’s Wild Dogs are both said to be put on hold. 
A major shoot that has been cancelled for now is the Baahubali franchise director SS Rajamouli’s next biggie, RRR. The ambitious film stars Ram Charan and Jr. NTR with Bollywood stars Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn. Irish actors Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody also feature in prominent roles in the film. The film might not release in January 2021, as was being said.
Films that were already released have also suffered. In Tamil Nadu, Harish Kalyan’s Dharala Prabhu, which released last Friday, will be re-released when the theatres reopen. The actor took to social media to pen an emotional note thanking audience for the love and support given to his film, which managed to get a theatrical run of only a few days. 
The Tamil industry is indeed concerned because the weeks ahead had a big line-up for the fans featuring several superstars. These include Vijay’s Master, Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru, Dhanush’s Jagame Thandhiram, which were set to release in April. These films will now have to settle for fresh release date.

“With the heightening of COVID-19 pandemic risks, certain financial market segments have been experiencing a tightening of financial conditions as reflected in the hardening of yields and widening of spreads. 
“It is important to ensure that all market segments remain liquid and stable, and function normally,” RBI said in a release on Wednesday.
 Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has decided to conduct open market operations on March 20, 2020 (Friday) in the form of purchase of an aggregate amount of ₹10,000 crore of government securities through a multi-security auction using the multiple price method, it said.
 It will purchase securities with coupon rate of 8.20% (maturity February 15, 2022); 7.37% (April 16, 2023); 7.32% (January 28, 2024) and 7.72% (May 25, 2025).
 RBI said there is no notified amount against any of these securities within the aggregate ceiling of ₹10,000 crore set for the operation.
The result of the auction will be announced on the same day and payment to successful participants will be made during banking hours on March 23, 2020 (Monday).
 Successful participants should ensure availability of requisite amount of securities in their SGL accounts by 12 noon on March 23, 2020 (Monday), it added.
Watch: COVID-19: Masks and sanitisers are now essential commodities
 Earlier on Monday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has “enough policy tools and stands ready to take any measures” needed to help the economy tide over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
In two liquidity enhancing measures, Mr. Das announced another round of $ 2 billion dollar-rupee swap on March 23, and in another measure he said the RBI will continue to conduct the long-term repo operations (LTROs) of up to ₹1 lakh crore as and when the market needs it.
 On March 16, the RBI conducted the first dollar-swap for $ 2 billion under which the central bank buys rupee from the market by selling the dollars.
 On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth ₹1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review. 
 OMOs are money market tools to suck or inject liquidity into the system. When there is enough liquidity, the RBI resorts to selling of government securities to take out money supply, while it purchases the same when the market needs the money. ",economy

How to track down ‘rogue’ drones? IIT-Madras researchers may have a solution,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/iitm-researchers-develop-law-enforcement-drones/article31109034.ece,"It is a matter of national security. 
There has been a detection of unauthorised UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) hovering around the Indian airspace. Upon closer examination, it has been confirmed that these are rogue drones that have the capacity to set off a lethal airstrike. In such a scenario, what would be the most effective retaliatory measure that would not warrant bloodshed? 
To commission anti-UAVs equipped with an AI-powered software that would hack into the GPS navigation system of the enemy drone, changing its coordinates and neutralising operations — does it not sound like a subject that would interest Hollywood veteran Steven Spielberg?
This, however, is a year-long pet project designed by IIT-M researchers Vasu Gupta, final year student, Department of Aerospace Engineering, and his friend Rishabh Vashistha, a project associate. They were mentored by Ranjith Mohan, Assistant Professor, Department of Aerospace Engineering.
Aeromodelling is Vasu’s area of interest, as is Rishabh’s. Their design sensibilities matched, further cementing their fascination for aircraft. Their ultimate goal was to create a modular drone, whose components can be attached or detached and the flight controller, too, can be programmable as per requirement — akin to a Lego toy. 
They began brainstorming plausible solutions to real-time issues, before getting started on the hardware part. “I’m an aircraft designer, but I had to rely on Singapore and China for fabrication, which is a bad dependency. We had to import certain parts from China for this drone model,” says Vasu, adding that they had to build everything from scratch.
Ideally, law enforcement drones are used by Defence Forces and Intelligence Agencies for surveillance and rescue operations among other things. Theirs, Vasu says, is an electronic warfare model that could help the Armed Forces secure air spaces and track down unregulated drones.
It ‘hacks’ into rogue drones and sends false GPS signals for communication. The target drone’s GPS sensor would lock onto their fake radio station, which transmits signals at a much higher rate than the available one. In doing so, the drone generates fake GPS packets that are received by the enemy, thereby calibrating the rogue drones’ latitude and longitude positions, when it enters the airspace.

“Basically, ours will act as a GPS satellite. The rogue drone would think ours is a legit source and would begin to communicate from our radio station,” explains Vasu, “By this operation, you can change its latitude, longitude and altitude, and force them to land safely.”
In addition to this, visual sensors and cameras help to monitor the behaviour of civilians — whether he is armed or not. “Let’s assume that your posture defines your intentions. If there’s any suspicious activity involved, our drone would notify the operator waiting for his command. Once it gets approval, it can track you down,” he says. 
They had three attributes to factor in, in the larger framework of law enforcement drones: endurance, aero capacity and utility features. 
For example, the length and breath of the propellers and router configuration would determine whether the drone can fly for 30 minutes or whether it can withstand a maximum wind speed of 65 km/hr. They referred to drone models employed by other countries, particularly Israel. “There are a range of drones out there; micro, mini and nano. But what we are talking about is a quadcopter. Israel has its own combat vehicle,” says Rishabh, adding, “Buying is a relatively easier option, but we wanted to design a completely indigenous model.” What motivated Rishabh, having failed at several attempts at joining the Defence Forces, was his passion to “serve the country”.
The biggest advantage of their prototype lies in its ability to operate beyond the line of sight control — the upper limit being 400 feet altitude for drone operations. It can also intercept phone calls at 250 feet above ground level. “You can set it up in Delhi and fly in Hyderabad. This is not an issue, communication is controlled over the Internet,” says Rishabh, adding that it has a battery that can last up to 50 minutes, while the industry standard is over 40-45 minutes.
What’s inside?The individual components are: motors, propellers, lithium battery, radio elementary antenna, flight controller, camera and sensors. With payload, it can last up to 25-30 minutes of flight capacity. The drone model weighs about 4 kg and can carry a fully-loaded rifle.The software is completely modular and has been coded in C++ and Python.It took a year-and-a-half to build their drone model, costing over ₹9 lakh. 
Their drone is also equipped with swarming technology — a technique that deploys drones in squadrons. They, in fact, tested with 25 drones at disposal, “You take complete control of a region by swarming. Ten drones can secure an airspace of 20 kilometres. You can also employ tracking and shooting,” he adds.
Vasu and Rishabh flirted with the idea of attaching firearms in their drone model, but have not got permission to carry out tests for obvious reasons. “It has provision to carry a fully-loaded rifle [like an AK 47]. It may drift about 8-10 cm, but can withstand its recoil. This is something we actively worked on and look forward to testing in real-time,” says Vasu.

A 2019 report states that India reported over six lakh rogue drones of varying size and capacity — of which most of them were termed “potential threat”. Currently, measures are being taken to develop and deploy counter-drones. Vasu and Rishabh presented their model at the Defence Expo 2020 held recently in Lucknow. Talks have been initiated with the Tamil Nadu Commando Force and Madhya Pradesh Government, but nothing has been finalised yet. “It’s a long process that takes about five to six months just to foster a meeting. It’s a back-and-forth process,” adds Rishabh.

Vir Das: Stand-up has a larger audience in rural India,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vir-das-interview-postponed-the-loved-tour-and-his-audience-range-and-future-plans/article31111430.ece,"Vir Das is, perhaps, in the hottest streaks of his life. Over the last two years, he has performed to full houses at home and abroad. 
He has opened for Conan on TBS and has been on Netflix and Amazon Prime. He will soon return to movies this year (the sequel of Go Goa Gone is being readied). 
One could argue that it is tougher for a comedian to prolong his success than it is for other artistes, say a musician. A tune, like wine, can get better with time. But jokes, usually, go stale soon. To remain relevant, Vir attempts to veer away from the usual. 
Take his latest Netflix show, For India, for instance. It was neither a political satire nor a collection of exaggerated personal stories — the two themes that is oft-repeated in the Indian stand-up scene. 
With For India he chose to speak, sitting in front of a door on stage, to an audience segregated into Indians, foreigners and expats. He was talking about what he thought made India to those who knew about the country and those who wanted to know. 
Vir’s The Loved Tour, which was supposed tour 49 cities across India, including non-metro ones like Patna, Meerut and Shillong has been indefinitely postponed. He took to his Instagram on March 9 to make the announcement. 
“This new show is going to be about love. How one man questions all kinds of love — love for your family, your spouse, nation, God,” he says.
Vir who performed at Forum Shantiniketan Mall on March 7 for the Bengaluru leg of the show speaks about For India, his process of writing comedy and more.
Excerpts: 
You said in an interview that For India was born out of this question: ‘If I could tell you four things about my country, what would they be?’ There have been a few major developments in our country, like CAA, since the show. Today, if you were to tell four things about India, what would they be? 
It will be the same. In the show, I tried to talk about an India that can endure whatever is going on now. Leaders of today will be gone tomorrow. The tragedies of today will be gone tomorrow. But things like Old Monk, respecting your elders and Taj Mahal will live on.

For India's audience had an interesting seating arrangement, wherein a segment of expats and foreigners were seated separately. What was the idea behind that?
The idea was simple. You have a group of people, who are not from the country. And, when you are talking about something that is relevant to you; you try to be inclusive and make it relevant for them as well. 
The reason why I seated them separately is because I take some time to explain certain things exclusively for them. 
So, it is easy to highlight them with the lighting [when they are seated separately]. And, visually, it is interesting as well.

Was it especially challenging to write for this show considering there were two sets of audience? 
The idea of this show was to challenge myself. A Netflix [comedy] special is usually 10 stories about your life. 
In this case, it wasn’t about me at all. It was 10 categories and five things per category. So, you are writing about 50 to 55 things as opposed to 10 things.
It was definitely challenging. But I kind of enjoyed that.
With ‘Jestination Unknown’, you took standup comedy to places such as Patiala, Kumarakom, etc. Do you think standup comedy would find a substantial audience in rural parts of India as well?
I think standup comedy has a larger audience in rural parts of India than in a metro. You find Hindi standup comedy videos getting 25 million views and English getting one or two million views.
 So, the larger audience is the regional segment. [With Jestination Unknown], the idea was to take live English comedy to these places. Hopefully, there will be an audience for that as well.

You speak about looking at standup comedy as art. And, it is increasingly becoming popular in India. Do you think it can be formally taught in educational institutions? 
I don’t think so. It can be learnt by watching. Of course, you have workshops about joke-writing. But you have to be a fan of the art form.
Could you talk about the difficulty in writing comedy. One would assume experience makes it easier. However, there might also be the challenge to differ from your previous work.
For me it is getting harder. Because I make it that way. I like to have a healthy fear of failure on every subsequent project. 
You are never really in a comfort zone. You try and write something different each time.
Do you talk to your audience after every show?  
No. But the audience talk to you during the show. And, I am not talking about comments, but about laughter. 
The kind of laughter is more informative than the comments. So, I record every show and listen to it later.
Comedians usually exaggerate something to make it sound funny. But if you do too much, then, it becomes forced. Where do you draw the line? 
I don’t draw the line. The audience does. I figured that out a while ago. I am not in charge of the line, they are.
I just have to keep writing and they will let me know where the line is. But if you are worried about drawing the line yourself, you are not going to write anything great.",entertainment
"'Koothu', a stand-up comedy web reality show in Malayalam, gets set to tickle your ribs",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/koothu-a-stand-up-comedy-web-reality-show-in-malayalam-gets-set-to-tickle-your-ribs/article31108007.ece,"Laughter is the best medicine, they say. So, if you think you have it in you to tickle the funny bones, here’s your chance to have a crack at stand-up comedy. YouTube channel Cineprise Entertainments has invited entries for its stand-up comedy web reality show called Koothu, perhaps a first of its kind in South India. Hosted by Kochi-based stand-up artiste Vinay Menon, Koothu will bring together a final selection of 10 contestants for the show, to be shot in select venues across the State.
“Aspiring stand-up comedians who wish to participate can send us a two-minute performance video on any topic, shot in portrait mode. The focus is on bringing out and providing a platform for amateur stand-up comics,” says Vinay, who will be mentoring the 10 contestants during the show.
He points out that the show intends to rope in comic artistes “who are not just funny but are good in writing comedy and also have a noticeable presence in social media”, thus looking at their “overall” profile. “They can perform in Malayalam, English or ‘Manglish’ depending on the participant’s comfort level,” says Vinay, adding that there’s no age restriction for entries.
With digital content gaining wider traction and a large chunk of feedback pouring in from “social media”, the show’s makers aim to keep the “voting” process primarily online. “As the show progresses, audience votes will be mainly online-based as it is ostensibly more convenient. Also, instead of merely just blindly voting, audience can have the advantage of going back and checking the content again to make a better judgement,” explains Vinay, who spearheads the collective Comedy Lounge.
He says the show also wants to steer clear of the “customary drama” associated with judges and the assessment methods that are often part of reality shows. “The idea is to help contestants perform in front of a crowd and that performance is the content. The analysis and adjudication will be carried out behind-the-scenes. The episodes will be in such a format wherein all 10 contestants will be performing for every episode in the initial rounds,” says Vinay. Amal Krishna, executive producer of Cineprise Entertainments, says the show will follow a points-based system revolving around voting and elimination.
Describing humour as “democratic,” Vinay says one advantage of bringing out such a show as a web series is the “greater creative independence” it lends, unperturbed by censorship concerns. The show was originally scheduled to launch in April but the premier has been indefinitely pushed back owing to the ongoing Coronavirus scenario.
Vinay says the show’s title, Koothu, is a nod to the performance art form Chakyarkoothu for the parallels he finds between it and stand-up comedy. “Both thrive on elements of satire and possess the ability to take potshots at society, often through an engaging story people can relate to. Both forms are down-to-earth and can be hard-hitting when delivered well,” he says, adding that the challenge is to entertain “different types of audience” as the jokes come with a lot of modern-day references.

Relief fund to be set up for those hit in Kannada entertainment industry,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/relief-fund-to-be-set-up-for-those-hit-in-entertainment-industry/article31105271.ece,"The Karnataka Film Workers, Artists and Technicians’ Federation is set to establish a relief fund for daily wage earners in the Kannada entertainment industry where, for the most part, productions have come to a halt. 
While television productions are still happening, the film industry has stopped shooting. The decision to establish a fund for workers who will be impacted comes a day after a similar relief measure was announced by the Producers’ Guild of India on Tuesday.
“We have decided to request the Chief Minister and our film stars to contribute to the fund so that we can at least ensure supply of groceries, medicines and give out small loans to daily wage earners who have lost their livelihoods due to the shutdown,” said Ashok, president, Karnataka Film Workers, Artists and Technicians’ Federation. 
“We have had a similar experience when Dr. Rajkumar was kidnapped in 2000, when the industry shut down for a long duration in protest,” he said. D.R. Jayaraj, chairman, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, said film shoots are unlikely to restart until the government decides to ease restrictions on gatherings and large crowds. 
“It’s not only daily wage workers. Everyone is suffering, including exhibitors and producers. Most film productions run on borrowed money from the market and the interest is only growing. Exhibitors are suffering huge losses as all theatres are closed,” said Mr Jayaraj. 
 “Unlike films whose releases can be rescheduled, television shows are critical to fill airtime. We are in touch with all channels and if the situation further worsens, we will also cease productions for a week,” said S.V. Shivakumar, president, Kannada Television Association.

This ghost walk tour lets you enjoy spooky tales from your couch,https://www.thehindu.com/society/this-ghost-walk-tour-lets-you-enjoy-spooky-tales-from-your-couch/article31108883.ece,"When historian Anthony Khatchaturian starts a narrative with “What lies beneath...” you know you’ll be biting your nails by the time that sentence is completed. Known to lead midnight ghost and history trails in Kolkata, he is now starting off with virtual ghost tours. 
“I had to adapt or die,” says Anthony, adding, “The economy hasn’t been great recently so I had a bad season, then Covid came along with a eulogy for the tourism and allied industries. I was brainstorming with Prof Souvik Mukherjee, Head of English at Presidency College in Kolkata, and he suggested I go virtual.” 
Anthony’s first virtual walk will take place this Saturday — way after sunset — when the rest of the city is tucked into their beds and the roads are barren and eerily quiet. That is when he will boldly step into the scene, exploring buildings and spaces whose mysterious pasts still make their presence felt. And will Anthony be all by himself? “I hope not,” he laughs. 
The plan is to bring along academics and historians, both amateur and professional, who can conduct a live question and answer session at every location and share their knowledge about those locations too. 







People — no matter which city they are in — can join whichever tour they want on Anthony’s Virtual Tours page on Facebook and he will then add them to a Skype group call. “I will start the conference video call from my starting point — the camera will face me when I explain the history and it will pan towards the buildings as I talk about them and their particular features,” he explains. 
He is also hoping he can hold at least 11 people on a video conference call and he is currently harassing his friends conducting trial runs to iron out the creases. If this works well, he plans to make all the tours virtual, including the Colonial Cemeteries, Dalhousie and Brabourne Road areas.
And what can viewers expect? Spooky tales and nuggets of information such as this: The busy T-junction in front of Writer’s Buildings in Kolkata is famous for traffic jams but only few know of the horrors that lie below. 







“It was in this spot that the dead from the infamous ‘Black Hole of Calcutta’ incident were brought out and buried in a makeshift mass grave in what was then the compound of St Anne’s Church, which was damaged in the Battle of Lal Dighi — the fight for Calcutta between Siraj ud Daula and the East India Company. The church was demolished, the site of the grave had a monument with the names of the deceased — which has since been moved to St John’s Church just over a kilometre down the road and Writer’s Buildings has come up, but the dead still lay six feet below a busy crossing!”
Is Anthony confident of virtual tours working out in India, given that a lot of us like to experience all aspects of a product, particularly touch and feel?
Anthony says, “We certainly are touchy/feely, but this not only gives those locked up at home due to COVID-19 a chance to do something other than watch streaming services, but I am hoping it makes tourism accessible and cheap for those sitting in different parts of the world.”
The duration of the walk is two hours and is priced at ₹500. It starts at 11.30 pm on March 21. For details, log on to Anthony’s Kolkata Heritage Tours on Facebook.",society
A rehabilitation venture for the differently-abled children of tea estate workers in Munnar turns 25 ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/aranya-natural-in-munnar-turns-tea-waste-into-natural-dyes-that-colour-georgettes-silks-and-chiffons-fabrics-for-the-worlds-top-fashion-houses-the-project-which-that-began-as-a-rehabilitation-venture-recently-turned-25/article31108576.ece,"Workers in navy blue uniforms at Aranya Naturals’ dyeing unit at Nallathanni in Munnar are busy. A row of tables splits the high-roofed space into two; on one side are water-filled basins over which women, wearing gloves, stir the contents. On the other side, inside a glass enclosure, eight women sit around a table tying thread around fabric for shibori; while at the far end 12 metres of indigo dyed fabric suspended by a winch hang over a steel drum. “The drum holds 2500 litres of indigo dye,” guide and floor supervisor, the ever smiling Bhanumathi K says. 
Each of the 37 people working here has been affected by a physical disability — hearing and/or speech impairment or other challenges. Together, they create Aranya fabric, which travels across the country and the world from Sri Lanka to Los Angeles and California. 







Aranya, which just turned 25, is one of Munnar-based Srishti Trust’s projects. Srishti, backed by Tata Tea Limited (now Tata Consumer Products Limited), has been working with the differently-abled children of estate workers since 1991 and Aranya was formed in 1994. It grew out of an idea that Srishti Managing Trustee Ratna Krishna Kumar had after attending a dyeing workshop. (Ratna’s husband RK Krishna Kumar was the Managing Director of Tata Tea Limited, when it launched.) Right from get go Ratna says she was clear that the project would be for the differently-abled children of estate workers and their rehabilitation. 
One of the team’s first clients was Polo (Ralph Lauren) for whom they dyed georgette, silk and chiffon (for dresses). Today, ‘Amari’, the boutique attached to Aranya proudly showcases shawls, stoles, yardage and garments fashioned out of tie-dye, in varied patterns of shibori and itagimi. It is set in a large campus, surrounded by gardens, which the team moved into in 1996. However, the project began in an abandoned shed in Tata Tea’s Nettimudi estate, when the team, turned the space into a lab, using mud pots and a wood-fired stove. These experiments grew into Aranya Natural. 







How it began and sustained for a quarter century is an interweaving of lives and stories. If the genesis lay in Ratna’s idea, it was carried forth, with her and Tata Tea’s support, by people such as Victoria Vijayakumar who co-ordinated activities over the years and the differently-abled, like Bhanumathi, who has been with the team for 25 years.
Bhanumathi says she came to Aranya as an 18 year-old, “a Class 10 pass”, in her own words, “with two club feet and nothing much to look forward to.” She tears up speaking of how her life changed because of her work: she is married and has a son, a Class 10 student of the High Range School in Munnar. Most importantly, she is able to support her aged parents. Bhanumathi was among Aranya’s first four employees and the only woman then. 







The cheerful co-ordinator Victoria Vijayakumar, Vicky Ma’am to the ‘children’, became part of Aranya serendipitously. She was the translator for the introductory dyeing workshop by Darshan Shah. 
“I was translating from English to Tamil for the workshop. I had to focus completely on what was being said, because if I didn’t I would mislead the children,” she says. At night she would pore over the dictionary to check if she got the terms right. “By the end I knew enough about dyeing to become part of Aranya.” She remembers the initial days of trial and error, when along with Ratna she and new recruits would experiment, “the water here has many minerals which makes it ideal for this activity,” she says. 







The fledgling venture experimented for two years before they started getting their first orders. “By then we felt confident enough. One of the first orders, if I remember correctly, was for saris. Initially it was a nightmare, but we got it right,” says Victoria. Most of the fabric is made to order, therefore the quantity produced varies. Some of the labels they work include Barefoot (Sri Lanka) and Eileen Fischer (New York). They also work with designers, including Kochi-based Sreejith Jeevan, Mumbai-based Riddhi Jain and Sunitha Shankar from Pune.
Raw material, for most of the dyes, is natural and local. Tea waste, eucalyptus grandis, eupatorium (Nilgiri kozha) and ageratum are some of the plants from which the dyes are made. A lot of these come from the forest floor. “We use things that will not be of any other use like barks of trees,” says Victoria Vijayakumar. Fittingly, they also use tea waste since Munnar is tea country. The tea that spills over in the factory during the processes, which would otherwise be discarded, is collected, boiled and made into beige coloured dye. 
There is constant focus on training. Victoria has travelled with some of the workers to seminars and workshops across the country, as well as to the United States, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, France, Italy and Japan. 
P Arumugham smiles shyly as Bhanumathi introduces him. She holds up a sample of ‘Aru shibori’, his innovative take on traditional Arashi shibori: although patterns are set the team is encouraged to experiment. Japanese dyeing expert Yoshiko Wada, who works with Aranya Naturals, impressed by Arumugham’s creation, named it ‘Aru shibori’. 
The pay-off for Ratna, Victoria and everybody else involved is the transformation on the faces of Bhanumathi, Arumugham and others. That look on Arumugham’s face when he explains how Aru shibori is done. 
 
Aranya Natural is at Nallathanni (Munnar) ahead of the KDHP Tea Museum alongside Athulya (hand-made paper unit) and Nisarga (strawberry/fruit preserve unit), which are among Srishti’s other projects.

A selfie with Corona,https://www.thehindu.com/society/corona-textiles-and-readymades-at-muvattupuzha-has-become-a-selfie-point/article31107599.ece,"
What’s in a name? Plenty, according to KE Pareeth. When searching for a name for his line of executive shirts, he stumbled upon Corona, which means crown in Latin. Pareeth, who felt that the word had a nice ring to it, decided to brand his shirts, Corona. And while the line is now defunct, Corona Textiles and Readymades, a small clothing store at Beevipaddi, Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam is currently a centre of attention for passers-by. “Many stop by to click selfies and photos with either the name board or with me in front of it,” says Pareeth with a chuckle, over the phone.
A class seven drop-out, Pareeth, who opened the store, learnt tailoring from his brother Makkar before deciding to branch out on his own. And so with just a single sewing machine, he started Mini Tailors in 1978 at Pezhakkappilly, Muvattupuzha. “I then opened Pant House, a tailoring shop with several employees working under me at Pezhakkappilly,” he says.

As their stitching centre became known for their well-stitched shirts, Pareeth decided to launch two shirt brands in 1993 — Yaka shirt (stitched from a thick variety of cotton) and Corona. “I, however, had to fold the unit as we faced stiff competition and lacked the marketing know-how to promote our lines,” he explains. He then started Corona Textiles and Readymades at Pezhakkappilly in 1997 before shifting the store to the current location two years ago. “And no, we no longer have a tailoring unit.”
Pareeth, better known in and around his locality as ‘Corona Pareeth’, says, “When I started the store, it was just another clothing outlet with an unusual name. Now, it’s the cynosure of all eyes because of the Coronavirus,” says the 60-year-old. He adds that it was a journalist-friend who first featured his shop in Pezhakkappilly’s local cable channel.
“Since then, I have been flooded with phone calls and visits from news channels and publications,” says Pareeth, who is assisted by his wife, Subaida, at the store. Many now stop by to ask him about his choice of name for the store. “Some of them even pick up an outfit or two.” 
Pareeth, who now has hand sanitisers for customers at the store, says he does not intend to change the name of the store. “The name has stood me in good stead over the years and so I intend to continue with it,” he avers.",society
Listen to your body ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/listen-to-your-body/article31106992.ece,"We call ourselves humans. When we tell someone, “You’re behaving like an animal,” we mean that as criticism. For good decision-making, it is important to use our higher faculties as a human being. But physiologically, we should not forget that we are also animals. Our higher faculties or mental functions cannot function independent of our body. We have cycles of hunger, thirst, digestion, sleep, energy levels, etc., like all animals do. These cycles reflect the biological ebb and flow of functions in our tissues. We are prone to disrupting these functions in modern life because we subjugate our lifestyle to external needs, to long-term plans and short-term stress. This habit of disrupting the body rhythms is often internalised to the point where people do not even realise they are doing it.
The internal body clock is evolutionarily ancient. Disrupting the sleep and wakefulness cycle has a profound impact on our health. For instance, some countries follow daylight saving time by shifting their clock forward by one hour in spring and back one hour in autumn. Research shows that there is an increased risk of dying immediately afterwards in the elderly and unwell. The small change of even one hour in the sleep rhythm stresses the body and this shows up as increased cardiovascular problems, especially heart attacks.
A lifestyle that goes against these biorhythms is a recipe for ill health. There are surprising findings about the impact of the body rhythm on surgical recovery for instance. A 2017 study in the prestigious medical journal, Lancet, showed that patients undergoing open heart surgery in the afternoon had half the rate of heart damage when compared to patients undergoing the surgery in the morning. The researchers explained that this was most likely due to the internal rhythm of the body — your heart is naturally more susceptible to damage in the morning than the afternoon! Our hormones too have a daily cycle. The stress hormone, cortisol, rises and falls through the day and night.
For good health
To maintain good health, Ayurveda gives us wonderfully insightful advice: do not suppress or instigate the innate functions of the body like hunger, thirst, and sleep. Listen to these urges and let them happen naturally. When we practise asana and pranayama in yoga, we have a golden opportunity to listen to our body sensations and adapt to them. For example, maintaining a healthy weight and metabolism is related to the timing of food too, not just the quality or quantity of food. When it is time for food and we are hungry, the digestive system prepares itself for food, already beginning to secrete enzymes for breaking down the food that it anticipates will reach it.
If we eat when we are not hungry at all, or we do not eat when we are hungry, it throws off the rhythm of the digestive system. When we postpone our lunch because we have a meeting at that time, or we force ourselves to have an early lunch even though we are not hungry because we have a meeting later, we create confusion in our metabolism. Our metabolism does not follow the future based thinking of the mind; it functions in the present.
As you begin listening to your body more closely, you will see that hunger is a complex feeling; there are many levels of hunger. There is the hunger as a lack of energy from the level of the tissues. There is a drop of fuels such as glucose in the blood. Digestive hunger is when we feel a lack of satiety, a feeling of emptiness, in the stomach and digestive tract. Emotional hunger is when we eat as a substitute for other emotional needs. Cognitive hunger is when we eat because we recall food. Social hunger is when we eat because the setting demands it. Programmed hunger is when we eat because of habituation to the time or circumstances.
Paying attention to our internal state is a way for us to understand the differences between these forms of hunger. If we don’t, we will gradually lose sight of what it is to eat for healthful reasons!
Similar to hunger, it is important to learn to sense our other body rhythms like sleep and energy levels too. Yoga is a golden way to be present in the moment, be present with the body, and listen to its rhythms. In the fast pace of modern life, this is one of the best skills you can cultivate for wellbeing and long life.",society
‘Built to last’ IT sector will navigate through: study ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/built-to-last-it-sector-will-navigate-through-study/article31111408.ece,"The IT sector is ‘built to last’ and will navigate through the near-term economic shocks, says HDFC Securities Institutional Research.
However, on account of COVID-19, the research forecasts a delay in pipeline conversion and core business, impacting pricing during Q2FY21.
The research spotted improving ‘structural’ trends in key demand drivers, technology supply-chain (trends from leading global products and platform), and supply metrics (H-1B trends on wages, count and geo diversification).
“Our checks with IT companies suggest a moderate acceleration in deal pipeline, some 5-20% increase in ACV of digital deals, growth in digital, driven largely by existing logos indicating increasing stickiness, continuity in vendor consolidation, and limited impact on service delivery from COVID-19, with risk of pipeline conversion uncertainty,”’ said the research report.
The study also confirmed an uptick in retail and CPG and robust tech spend in BFSI, despite growth slowdown. “Tech spend intensity by large BFS remains strong, despite the recent slowdown (about6% YoY growth in BFS tech spend even though revenue growth was 1.6% in CY19),’’ it said.
Notwithstanding the interest rate trajectory impacting revnue performance, tech spend is supported by investments to build strong digital channels/platforms, decommissioning of legacy applications and deployment of BOTs/automation, infrastructure modernisation with shift to hybrid cloud model, and investments in RegTech and Security, the HDFC Securities study observed.
The study also spoke about an improvement in onsite metrics. Indian IT’s H-1B dependence has lowered based on increasing localisation, lower H-1B count and geo-diversification offsetting the impact of rising H-1B wages. Onsite wage inflationary risk mitigated by geo diversification of H-1B (shift to lower cost delivery locations of Texas, Virginia, Florida, Connecticut as compared to California and NYNJ cluster).
Digital playbook remained intact for Indian IT, it further said. “There is shift to hybrid cloud and multi-cloud model. Also there is increase in size of digital deals, examples being: Microsoft’s $10million plus signings, SAP’s €5mn cloud deal. Also there is focus on verticalisation of cloud offerings, in addition to visible digital growth in core verticals such as BFSI and retail impact on travel and hospitality segment expected to be higher (Mindtree/Hexaware).’’",business
Virus-hit tourism sector seeks bail out from PM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-hit-tourism-sector-seeks-bail-out-from-pm/article31111386.ece,"The Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH) has sought the immediate intervention of the Prime Minister as the industry was in dire straits and stared at the prospect of unemployment of 38 million people and bankruptcy due to COVID-19.

Banks have been asked to monitor key installation centres such as data centres holding the core banking solutions, ATM switch, treasury and SWIFT operations centre, among others. Key officials managing these installations have been advised not to remain in the same office. The plan suggested splitting of treasury functions in different locations and an alternative disaster recovery (DRC) centre in case of complete shutdown of a building where such operations are located.

Yes Bank yet to use RBI’s credit lifeline,https://www.thehindu.com/business/yes-bank-yet-to-use-rbis-credit-lifeline/article31111370.ece,"After the moratorium was withdrawn from Yes Bank on Wednesday at 6 p.m. the troubled lender, so far, has not drawn from the creditline provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), indicating the bank is having sufficient liquidity to tide over the initial bout of cash withdrawals.
The RBI had sanctioned ₹59,000 crore for Yes Bank under the section 17(4) of the RBI Act that allows the central bank to give loans to lenders in lieu of securities. Sources said if Yes Bank were unable meet cash withdrawal demands on its own, then the limit would have been used. They said initial trends suggested the bank was able to meet cash withdrawal demand and there was also a good amount of funds deposited with the lender. 
“Initial trend suggest, the deposits are more than the withdrawals. So, the bank has not utilised the RBI credit line so far,” the sources said.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had assured that the RBI would provide liquidity to Yes Bank if needed, after moratorium was lifted. 
“Yes Bank has enough liquidity to meet any requirement. If there is a requirement, the RBI will provide necessary liquidity support to meet its requirements. So, that is a comforting factor for the depositors that the RBI will support Yes Bank if liquidity is required,” he had said.
The private sector lender was put on moratorium on March 5 following worsening financial condition and cash withdrawals were capped at ₹50,000. This was followed by superseding the bank’s board by RBI and an administrator was appointed.

Retailers face large-scale closures amid COVID-19 alert,https://www.thehindu.com/business/retailers-face-large-scale-closures-amid-covid-19-alert/article31111364.ece,"Organised retailers, dealing with non-essential daily use items, are struggling to keep their business operations on, even as State governments are coming out with new regulations to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 
Though all business establishments inside shopping malls, other than those dealing with essential items such as grocery and vegetables, have been closed, several standalone stores of organised retail chains have also been closed to comply with the regulations. 
According to retailers, authorities are not allowing stores located in densely populated areas to remain open. In Mumbai, civic authorities have identified areas where shops other than those selling groceries and medicines will remain open every alternate day. Similarly, authorities in Gurugram have imposed fresh restrictions. The ban on the presence of more than 50 people at one place is preventing many large stores from remaining open as their employee strength itself is high.
For example Croma, which had shut down 60 stores as of Wednesday, had to close 30 more outlets on Thursday to comply with restrictions. Earlier this week, the retail chain had shuttered certain standalone stores in Mumbai, which have now reopened. Croma has 161 stores nationally.
Ritesh Ghosal, Chief Marketing Officer, Croma, said, “Some of our stores are shut in light of the current events; however, due to our omni presence, we are able to cater to customers’ demand via croma.com. Customers are choosing options like 3-hour delivery on personal gadgets, next-day delivery on home appliances... We are ensuring utmost hygiene for our delivery staff and vehicles as well,” he said. Westside had to close 59 of its 164 outlets. These include 40 stores located in malls and 19 standalone units.",business
IndiGo announces pay cut for its employees,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indigo-announces-pay-cut-for-its-employees/article31111354.ece," IndiGo announced pay cuts for its staff with CEO Ronojoy Dutta volunteering to give up 25% of his remuneration.
“With a great deal of reluctance and a deep sense of regret, we are, therefore, instituting pay cuts for all employees excluding Bands A and B, starting April 1, 2020. I am personally taking a 25% pay cut, SVPs and above are taking 20%, VPs and cockpit crew are taking a 15% pay cut, AVPs, Bands D along with cabin crew will take 10% and Band C 5%. We know how hard it is for families to take a cut in take home pay. But unfortunately, it is impossible for our company to fly through this economic storm without all of us making some sacrifices,” Mr. Dutta wrote to his employees.
The move was necessitated because of a sharp fall in revenue, forcing the airline to pay careful attention to cash flows so that it did not run out of cash.

It may take 6 months for normalcy: CII,https://www.thehindu.com/business/it-may-take-6-months-for-normalcy-cii/article31111352.ece,"India Inc. may require at least three to six months to restore normalcy and business continuity after the entire course of the COVID-19 event is over, says Vikram Kirloskar, president, Confederation of Indian Industry.
“All of us are facing a tough challenge. Overall, things are not looking good. All industrial segments are suffering. Small-scale industries are under severe pressure. Large industries can’t run without ancillary companies and supply chain support. 
“Stock markets are down globally. The rupee is under attack,’’ Mr. Kirloskar told The Hindu.
However, he said, “The good news is that, the Indian government has been handling the issue very sensibly, right from the beginning, compared with other affected geographies. Some say India is the safest place today.’’
The CII has asked all its members to take up leadership role in ensuring the safety of enterprises, employees and society as a whole, and do not rely on rumours that are floating around.
“None of us should panic, rather, we should strictly adhere to advisories, stay calm, move around responsibly, work hard to contain and fight COVID-19, is the message CII wants to give out to all individuals, small entrepreneurs and large corporates in this country,’’ said Mr. Kisloskar.
He said he was supposed to have met a Japanese visitor in India on March 4, but the latter was not allowed into the country and was sent back from the airport itself. 
“That means, our government has started taking precautions from the beginning of March. Therefore, I hope and trust that the numbers given out, of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, are correct, of course with some plus or minus.’’
According to him, Indian corporates have been proactive as they are already allowing a lot of their employees to work from home.
“Companies now have to adopt various measures, including cutting operational cost and introducing effective risk management solutions to be able to come out unscathed.’’
As a piece of advice, Mr. Kirloskar said, businesses now have the heavy responsibility of realigning, not retrenching, their people effectively.
“Some top managers may have to take serious pay cuts, some employees can be sent on unpaid vacation for a few months while in some cases, employees may be asked to work extra hours/days to compensate the time that’s lost. However, companies should keep their most critical asset, the people, in safe custody,’’ he urged.
As a word of caution to people, he said, citizens, too, have to be highly responsible. People were missing quarantine and jumping on train or playing in the open. “Don’t take any risk at least for two weeks. We are one of the few countries where COVID-19 which is under control. We have to stop the virus from spreading, which is critical for the safety of our life and livelihood.’’
As per Mr. Kirloskar, the media, overall, has been doing a responsible job in terms of handling virus stories. “However, I am not tracking much of social media, because if I did I may go mad, so I avoid it,’’ he added.",business
Crisil cuts FY21 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%,https://www.thehindu.com/business/crisil-cuts-fy21-gdp-growth-forecast-to-52/article31111348.ece,"Crisil has cut India’s GDP growth rate forecast for FY21 citing financial sector stress and COVID-19 impact.
Crisil, while observing that domestic consumption demand may take some hit, said it was too early for it to get reflected in data.
“Currently, the other downside to growth is also due to the financial sector stress now percolating to private sector banks. In view of this, Crisil has cut its base-case GDP growth forecast for fiscal 2021 to 5.2%, from 5.7% announced recently,” it said, adding the forecast will be reassessed continuously as new information becomes available.
Crisil said a serious downside to the base case can emerge from two developments, one, the pandemic is not contained by April-June 2020 globally, and makes the global slowdown more severe.
“And two, it spreads rapidly in India, affecting domestic consumption, investment, and production. These would further hurt confidence and the financial markets,” it added. ",business
Real estate sector likely to suffer big jolt ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/real-estate-sector-likely-to-suffer-big-jolt/article31111338.ece,"The spread of COVID-19 in India and the resultant restrictions imposed by government authorities to contain it is expected to impact the real estate sector significantly, say developers and analysts.
“In the mid-term, it is expected that new sales will be badly impacted and there will be a surge in default by customers. This will certainly have a cascading effect on the repayment of loans availed by customers and developers,” said Sanjay Daga, chief operating officer, Runwal Developers.
He said developers would face the daunting task of servicing interest outflows amid constrained cash inflows, postponement of instalments and interest subsidy. “There is a lot of volatility expected in the market resulting in job losses and sustainability of businesses will be at stake,” he said.
“While it is too early and difficult to predict the exact impact on the realty market, we need to wait for the full economic cycle and implications that come along with it in the coming months,” he added. Farshid Cooper, MD of Spenta Corporation, said the disruptions in the business cycle are bound to impact the demand for commercial as well as residential real estate.
“People are avoiding stepping out of homes and hence there is a dip in walk-ins across all residential projects too. Investors, as well as end-users, are opting for a ‘wait and watch’ policy amid the pandemic,” he said.
Ashok Mohanani, chairman, Ekta World and vice-president, Naredco Maharashtra, said, “The momentum in the housing market, which had begun to show some potential over the past few quarters, would likely slow down in the first half of 2020. There is definitely a fall in site visits by potential homebuyers. This, in turn, will have a cascading effect on sales of property.”
Commenting on the issue Niranjan Hiranandani, national president, Naredco, said, “The pandemic menace has hit at a particularly sensitive time, that of the financial year closing. Across real estate companies, this is the time when statutory pay-outs and streamlining of balance sheets happen.”
He said this year’s festive occasion of Gudi Padwa/Ugadi might see a drop in launches and delayed deal closures, following a direct effect on site visits by potential buyers. 
“When it comes to commercial real estate, the impact of COVID-19 in form of shutdown of retail outlets and malls as also entertainment and fitness centers has put commercial real estate deals on ‘wait and watch mode,” he added.
Anurag Mathur, CEO, Savills India said for the real estate industry, COVID-19 could prove to be an additional dampener in the short term as the sector is already under intense pressure because of the ongoing liquidity crunch and weak market sentiment.
“However, it is important to note that these are temporary disruptions and would not hold back the economy and the industry in the long run. We do not see any significant impact on investments into the sector in the long run because of the pandemic,” he added.",business

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) aviation business has been more impacted on falling ATF sales as it services more international flights, which witnessed higher cancellations in March.

China to screen ‘Harry Potter’ in 3D and 4K to revive cinemas post coronavirus pandemic,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/china-to-screen-harry-potter-in-3d-and-4k-to-revive-cinemas-post-coronavirus-pandemic/article31111836.ece,"Warner Bros.

According to Variety, the news was confirmed when the studio released a new poster in Chinese that showed Harry’s snowy old Hedwig flying with his Hogwarts acceptance letter that has his address in green ink, and a tag that reads, “Magic is coming.”






The new Chinese poster of ‘Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone’
 






Though no official release date has been revealed, it is expected to be around April 30, so that theatres can draw in crowds during the May 1 Labor Day weekend. 
The Harry Potter franchise has huge fandom in China, with the original eight movies, that starred the likes of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and other popular British actors (based on the seven books in the series) doing fantastic business upon release, and the re-release is expected to provide a boost right before the third Fantastic Beasts movie — a spin-off from the Harry Potter series — finds its way into the theatres eventually.
The news was understandably met with a lot of excitement online by not just fans of J.K Rowling’s series in China, but also all over the world, resonating that a bit of magic is exactly what the world needs during these troubled times. 
Variety also reported that China is attempting to revive its entertainment sector after nation-wide closures and that though a few cinemas have tried to reopen, business remains non-existence as several citizens are still practising isolation and social distancing. But from Beijing to the southwestern province of Yunnan, cinemas are now planning to re-open in some regions after the government approves their healthcare precautions.",movies
"'Bacurau' movie review: A confounding, dazzling and disturbing watch ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bacurau-movie-review-a-confounding-dazzling-and-disturbing-watch/article31111284.ece,"A gentle melody, a satellite going up from the Earth to the sky, the camera zooming in on the earth from up above to a long stretch of road with a solitary truck and an accident on the way of a biker and a truck loaded with coffins. All leading up to the milestone for the rural town of Bacurau that states, ‘17 kilometres away’ and that “if you go there, go in peace”. A preemptive warning or an enticing invitation for what lies ahead? The vivid opening sequence of the Brazilian film Bacurau sets the tone for what follows—one of the most beguiling of recent films; that captivates just as much as it confounds, dazzles as much as it disturbs.
The enigma is rooted in the telling and the tone and tenor that keeps changing as the narrative progresses. It starts off by following the tenets of a classic Western improvised to get the story rooted in the distinct space and context that it emerges from. And then somewhere in the middle it takes a sharp bizarre turn to become a seige thriller and an uber violent game of sorts, of armed combat. There are weird futuristic sci-fi--flying saucers and drones thrown in as well.
A young lady returns to her small town of Bacurau for her grandmother’s funeral. Bacurau is where all kinds of strange, sinister things are happening. Not just has its water supply been cut off and mobile signals are weakening but it has even disappeared from satellite maps and faces the threat of unknown, mysterious enemy. American mercenaries? White colonialists? Greedy corporates? Environmental predators? Plain menace? Or all of these?
 The film, set as it is “few years from now”, is a dire allegory for the dystopian future (and the present as well) full of disorder and disarray? Or is it all about doffing a hat to the unity and resilience of the community of underdogs that will eventually overcome the foes from outside? Trust my COVID-19 hit mind and overthinking but while watching it the second time it felt as though Filho and Dornelles had somehow seen the future. A bit too far-fetched a correlation, alright but one can be pardoned for harbouring such thoughts in these desperate times. After all, the whole world is a Bacurau right now resisting the corona enemy.
The trenchant critique of the politics and politicians is just as relatable to our own world—the lack of law and order, gangs running amuck, an uncared for, forsaken electorate, a hateful local politician, corrupt government. Where have we experienced it first hand? In waterless Bacurau it needs to be delivered by truck, bullet-riddled ones at that and the only reassurance for getting a regular supply is given when the local politician comes canvassing for votes for a second term. Uncannily familiar again. But will he still remember the promise after winning the seat? That’s anybody’s guess.

The industry doesn’t understand me: Mahesh Manjrekar ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-industry-doesnt-understand-me-mahesh-manjrekar/article31110018.ece,"A man of many parts, Mahesh Manjrekar is now making waves in the web circuit. After an impressive performance as a cricket coach in the Netflix series Selection Day, Manjrekar is being appreciated for his role as an aging husband in Shaad Ali’s Pawan & Pooja on MX Player. 
Edited excerpts:
What made you accept Pawan & Pooja? 
I liked the concept and role. Not to mention a great cast featuring the likes of Deepti Naval, Gul Panag, and Sharman Joshi. As the shoot progressed, I realised, I made the right choice. The story is about three different couples in the present times which have complications in their lives. So they are Pawan and Pooja in three different generations. Whatever age you are in, there are always complications in every relationship. People who say that have a perfect relationship are lying. We are talking about two different individuals in a relationship. How can there be no complication? The whole idea of making a successful love story is accepting each other’s problems, accommodating each other’s problems, and then sorting out the complications. In the series, we have tried not to be judgemental or strive for happy endings. The stories are presented as they are.
Tell us about the dynamics between the characters played by you and Deepti Naval.
I remember Deepti Naval from the film Ek Baar Phir. She really came across as a breath of fresh air in that film. She was also wonderful in films like Chashme Buddoor and Katha. She was very different from the heroines of the time. So I always liked her approach to cinema. She would never go overboard and did her job peacefully. The Pawan and Pooja that I and Deepti play have been married for 30 years. So they got married at a time when women didn’t have much of a choice. In a way, Pawan is complicit in the kind of life that she has lived. He loves her but as the husband, he is very happy knowing that he is the only bright spot in her life. Maybe, he has even taken her for granted. And then something happens which really shakes him up. 
How do you see the web as a medium vis-à-vis cinema?
When I started my career, I wanted to be an actor. But that time there weren’t many opportunities. So I did a lot of stage plays. But today there is so much work for any good actor. Now, when you are doing the web, people aren’t actually bothered whether you are a saleable actor or not. They only see if it’s the right actor or not for the role. Also, today talent has got precedence over your star value. So, it’s a great phase to be an actor.
You do a wide variety of films across different industries. How do you manage to strike a balance? 
I acted in Kaante because Sanjay Gupta insisted me to do it. At that time, I had never thought that I would be acting in films. Later on, I reached a point where I got sick and tired of doing the typical Hindi cinema kind of roles which they wanted me to do. I thought that I should do Marathi cinema as I knew that there I would be able to explore different subjects. But I also need the money and acting is my bread and butter. So I started doing Bollywood films merely for money. And there I don’t differentiate. I just ask them what they want me to do and the money that I would get paid for it and I just deliver. Even if they want me to do buffoonery, I give them that. I have compartmentalised that well. I don’t get hassled when I am doing a role that looks idiotic to me.
You haven’t been as prolific as a director as compared to your contemporaries despite having made critically and commercially successful films like Vaastav and Natsamrat 
Let me tell you what happens. I did a film called Kaksparsh which I think is one of my best works. Last year, I did a two-part film on the life of playwright and humorist P. L. Deshpande, which I loved doing. I consider Astitva, which I did two decades back, to be my best film. Then I have recently done Panghrun, releasing in April, which I feel would be my best work yet. So I am doing my own stuff. I don’t want to compromise it for the sake of money. If I need money, I can always go and act. The industry, somewhere, doesn’t understand me. You must understand that there are camps here – I am not talking about nepotism – I am talking about camps. And they are dangerous. They have this mentality of not letting anybody come into those camps. It doesn’t work for me. After I am done with the work, I don’t hang out for parties. I also avoid award functions. I just don’t like all that. I am comfortable in my space doing films that I want to. 
You contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai North West. What went wrong with your innings in politics? 
I would have ideally loved to make my own political party with people who are actually on the same wavelength. I did join politics but I soon realised that this was not what I wanted. The problem is that there are few leaders around who are actually trying to address people’s problems. Mostly what we get to see is divide and rule politics where people are being used by politicians. Now, I wouldn’t like to give it another shot until I have some like-minded people who are actually interested in addressing people’s problems. Let’s see if that ever happens. ",movies

Winds Of Winter has long been in the works, and now looks like the coronavirus outbreak has given Martin all the peace and solace he seeks to finish the novel. The 71-year-old wrote in his blog, Not a Blog, about the pandemic, posting, “Strange days are upon us. As ancient as I am, I cannot recall ever having lived through anything like the past few weeks.”
He also wrote that he realises he falls into the vulnerable category, given his “age and physical condition” but that he was feeling fine and staying in a “remote isolated location” and maintaining social distancing,
Martin stated, “I am off by myself in a remote isolated location, attended by one of my staff, and I’m not going in to town or seeing anyone. Truth be told, I am spending more time in Westeros than in the real world, writing every day.”
The novelist added, “Things are pretty grim in the Seven Kingdoms… but maybe not as grim as they may become here. Some days, watching the news, I cannot help feeling as if we are all now living in a science fiction novel. But not, alas, the sort of science fiction novel that I dreamed of living in when I was a kid, the one with the cities on the Moon, colonies on Mars, household robots programmed with the Three Laws, and flying cars.”
Martin concluded, asking his readers to stay safe: “I never liked the pandemic stories half so well… Let us hope we all come through this safe and sound. Stay well, my friends. Better to be safe than sorry.”",movies

BIFFes 2020: A window to the world,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/biffes-2020-a-window-to-the-world/article31108175.ece,"The recently concluded twelfth edition of BIFFes was easily the most competently organised in all these years. The crowds have swelled gradually over the years and the first day saw a queue befitting a blockbuster. The serpentine queues were pretty well regulated with the volunteers keeping a hawk’s eye for those who jumped or joined midway. The steep discount on foodstuff was welcome, though the service inside was a mild irritant. The Corona virus was yet to go viral, but people squirmed involuntarily whenever someone coughed continuously.
The quality of films has improved too. More producers are willing to send their work now probably because the digital format makes it much easier than sending reels. Film Festivals are a window to the vast world, from breathtakingly beautiful locales to the various languages, cultures, customs and colours of different people and landscapes. In one week, you get to traverse the globe with a single ticket sans passport or visa. What bind us are emotions and relationships which are universal. 
Andrei Tarkovsky and Anant Nag were honoured with richly deserved retrospectives. While Tarkovsky has inspired many a filmmaker, Anant is the envy of most performers for his sheer effortlessness as a performer. 
The atmosphere was definitely festive. Poring over the menu card of movies and scampering from screen to screen trying to time the next show is a common sight. 
Strangely, there’s a sense of satisfaction in knowing ours is not the only country where heinous crimes are committed against women or where only women are blamed for a childless marriage. ‘Zana’ is about a Kosovar woman browbeaten by her mother-in-law into meeting fertility experts as well as faith healers and witches in an effort to get her to conceive. The rich details about the customs of this clan in Kosovo are captured with a keen eye. In the lead role, Lume infuses an emptiness into her character, reacting with a physical attack only when her husband suggests getting another bride. 
Set in Melbourne, ‘Measure For Measure’ is a gritty tale about morality and mercy set in housing commission apartments. The characters are colourful — from a drug kingpin to an immigrant falling for a musician earning the wrath of her brother, a goon. Love is a key element, but the clash of cultures and egos has a foreboding of doom and gloom.
‘Sister’ from Bulgaria is about a mother and her two daughters. The younger one spins colourful tales to brighten up her dull existence selling the amateurishly crafted figurines they make. The yarns she spins seem innocuous till it alienates her sister and sends their boring existence into a tizzy turning the film into a psychological thriller while throwing relationships in disarray. The poignant climax highlights nature’s ability to bind people irrespective of their inherent nature and morals. 
‘All About Me’ is about a pudgy child who brightens lives around him with his mimicry even as he watches his mother’s health deteriorate after a botched surgery. Based on a best-selling autobiography, the film is about the therapeutic powers of laughter. The highlight of the film is the warm relationship that bonds the family and sees them emerge unscathed from emotional wounds. The film effortlessly makes you laugh and cry, as well. 
Next, we move to Turkey where a censor in charge of screening letters to and from prisoners, becomes fixated with the wife of a particular inmate. Fancying himself a writer, the officer starts imagining a tale that could possibly be true. Soon, curiosity turns to obsession, blurring the line between reality and imagination. 
‘A Regular Woman’ is based on a 2005 honour killing of the eldest daughter in a Sunni Muslim family by her youngest brother in Germany. Sadly, the sufferer is the woman’s child who thankfully wasn’t handed over to the family for whom honour is more important than their daughter’s happiness. ‘A Painted Bird’ from Venice is a three-hour tour of the hell a child undergoes in ravaged East Europe. The film was shot in black and white over several years to show the growth of the boy and his journey from innocence to the depths of despair after his encounters. The graphic scenes make you want to bolt out the door, but the cinematic quality keeps you riveted to your seat.
Film festivals are like train journeys where you may not meet old friends, but definitely make new ones. It’s the annual gathering of cinema gourmets who want to sample everything, but can’t for want of time, rather than an ability to digest.",movies

Users don’t have to download the movies or install a tracker. The streaming app became popular in 2014 for people who wanted to access films that were still running in theaters. However, it faced court orders and IP blocks, leaving to its eventual demise.

"I accept only scripts that resonate with me, says cinematographer Sanu Varughese",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cinematographer-sanu-varughese-talk-about-his-craft-and-his-upcoming-project-malik/article31105518.ece,"With movies in multiple languages, commercials and documentaries, cinematographer Sanu John Varughese is a busy man. His filmography includes movies like Karthik Calling Karthik, Elektra, Vishwaroopam, David, Wazir, Take Off, Badhaai Ho, Jersey and Android Kunjappan Version 5.25. The much-awaited Malik, directed by Mahesh Narayanan with Fahadh Faasil in the lead, is getting ready for release.
In an interview, Sanu talks about his work as a cinematographer and Malik. Edited excerpts.
After Mahesh’s Take Off, you are working with him again in Malik. What was your approach towards the two movies?
Both these movies are in totally different zones. Take Off was more of an internal story where we were travelling along with the character. The geography of the location in Malik is a major factor. The formats and the pitching are different as well.
When you are narrating a story based on true events or on people who actually lived, is it more challenging than narrating a fictional tale?
We have treated both Take Off and Malik as fiction though both are based on real incidents. When compared to Take Off, the visual language of Malik is more dramatic.

Special arrangement  





What were the challenges in creating the time frame in Malik?
That was a combined responsibility of mainly five departments — costume, make up, art, cinematography and direction. Malik has been an exciting project and it was creatively satisfying. I did feel nostalgic on seeing costumes from the 1970s, which brought back memories of my younger days in my home town.
Looking back, what prompted you to become a cinematographer?
My focus was on still photography while studying at the College of Fine Arts. Then I became a news cameraman. One thing led to another and in a matter of six years since the start of my career, I shot my first feature film, Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon in 2003.
Do cinematographers look for ways to leave their signature each time they work on a movie?
I don’t believe in that. Having said that, it is true that there would be some elements that come from our tastes, which could be seen as the director of photographer’s signature work. Cinematography can also be seen as a tool that sets the mood of a story pretty much like music, sound and silence.
So what is your working pattern like?
I accept only scripts that resonate with me. From the time of listening to a script, I make it a point to proceed through constant communication with the director. It is easier with directors like Mahesh who is good at visualising the story. Moreover, being an editor himself, he is sure about what he wants and that initial editing process is evident even in his writing.
When directors can visualise their story, there is more clarity during the shooting. See, movie-making is a collaborative effort. My process is always to find the director’s vision and to move in tandem with that. I have worked with many first-time directors and my effort is to go with them without tampering with their spirit. Usually, a well-written script will have its own visual flavour.
Is there a difference in the way you approach movies belonging to various genres?
Definitely, that difference will be there. For instance, while doing the sports movie Jersey (2019) in Telugu, the treatment was to capture the action as such. I approach each script based on the emotion that it intends to convey. The composition and lighting of every frame depend on the mood of the story.
Is there a huge difference in the shooting of Hindi and Malayalam films?
As the working costs are more in Hindi, I believe there are more experiments in regional languages these days. For instance, it would be quite difficult to make a fresh concept like Android Kunjappan Version 5.25 in Hindi.
Does the performance of the actors matter to a cinematographer?
Where you place the camera, how you light it and how you compose depend on the actor’s performance. There are times when seeing the eye of the actor is crucial to communicate the emotion of a scene. There are certain other times when seeing the body language in the context of the background is more effective in communicating the emotional content of the scene. This is again dependent on what the scene is conveying in the story being narrated. Performance does change the nature of cinematography. But the challenge for the cinematographer is to creatively interpret it in the context of the story being told.",movies

Big B spreads awareness of BMC’s stamp for quarantine,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/big-b-spreads-awareness-of-bmcs-stamp-for-quarantine/article31103579.ece,"
Who better to lend a strong hand to spread awareness of COVID-19 than Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan himself? Late on Tuesday, he tweeted a photograph of a hand with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) home quarantine stamp.
From Monday, the stamp in indelible ink stating: “Proud to protect Mumbaikars. Home quarantined,” is being put on the back of the left hand of people who need to stay isolated at home for suspected exposure to the coronavirus. These are people who do not have any symptoms but have recently returned from the affected countries. They are supposed to self-quarantine or home quarantine for 14 days, wherein BMC will monitor their symptoms. 
Mr. Bachchan tweeted alongside the picture, “Stamping started on hands with voter ink, in Mumbai .. keep safe, be cautious, remain isolated if detected.” The BMC handle in turn thanked him for spreading the word and “reiterating the need for #HomeQuarantine to those select few, for them to be safe, cautious & responsible towards not just near & dear ones, but all!”
However, the good effort also led to a bit of a confusion, with some assuming that Mr. Bachchan had been quarantined himself. However, his spokesperson told The Hindu that the picture was a representational image that had already been in circulation and not of his hand. Mr. Bachchan hasn’t travelled abroad recently, in fact he has been in Mumbai and working towards spreading awareness about COVID-19 among his fans. 
He recently cancelled the Sunday practice of meeting his fans at his Juhu bungalow Jalsa. He advised them to take precautions and stay safe and careful. 
Mr. Bachchan also tweeted about the World Health Organization and UNICEF asking him to send out video messages. A few days back, he had posted a video of the recitation of his self-penned poem on coronavirus. Written in Awadhi, it talks about how people are offering remedies like kalonji powder and amla juice, but the real deal to fight the virus is to maintain hygiene and keep washing hands with soap.",movies
About 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to coronavirus: UN ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/about-25-million-jobs-could-be-lost-worldwide-due-to-coronavirus-un/article31106548.ece," Nearly 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, but an internationally coordinated policy response can help lower the impact on global unemployment, according to a UN agency.
 In its preliminary assessment report titled “COVID-19 and world of work: Impacts and responses”, the International Labour Organization (ILO) calls for urgent, large-scale and coordinated measures across three pillars — protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and employment, and supporting jobs and incomes.
 The ILO said these measures include extending social protection, supporting employment retention (i.e short-time work, paid leave, other subsidies), and financial and tax relief, including for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
 It also proposes fiscal and monetary policy measures, and lending and financial support for specific economic sectors.

 The economic and labour crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic could increase global unemployment by almost 25 million, the ILO said.
“However, if we see an internationally coordinated policy response, as happened in the global financial crisis of 2008/9, then the impact on global unemployment could be significantly lower,” it added.
 The report provides different scenarios of how unemployment and underemployment will be impacted due to the coronavirus.
 Based on different scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on global GDP growth, the ILO estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. By comparison, the 2008-09 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million.
 Underemployment is also expected to increase on a large scale, as the economic consequences of the virus outbreak translate into reductions in working hours and wages.
 Self-employment in developing countries, which often serves to cushion the impact of changes, may not do so this time because of restrictions on the movement of people (e.g. service providers) and goods, it said.
Also read | Is the global economy headed for recession?
 The note said that falls in employment also meant large income losses for workers to the tune of between $860 billion and $3.4 trillion by the end of 2020. This will translate into falls in consumption of goods and services, in turn affecting the prospects for businesses and economies.
 Working poverty is expected to increase significantly too, as “the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line,” the ILO said.
 It estimates that between 8.8 and 35 million additional people will be in working poverty worldwide, compared to the original estimate for 2020 (which projected a decline of 14 million worldwide).
 Underscoring the need for swift and coordinated policy responses, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said “this is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labour market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people.” 
“In 2008, the world presented a united front to address the consequences of the global financial crisis, and the worst was averted. We need that kind of leadership and resolve now,” he added.
The ILO note warns that certain groups will be disproportionately affected by the jobs crisis, which could increase inequality.
These include people in less protected and low-paid jobs, particularly youth and older workers and women and migrants too, who are vulnerable due to the lack of social protection and rights, and women tend to be over-represented in low-paid jobs and affected sectors.
“In times of crisis like the current one, we have two key tools that can help mitigate the damage and restore public confidence. Firstly, social dialogue, engaging with workers and employers and their representatives, is vital for building public trust and support for the measures that we need to overcome this crisis.

 Traders said there is a sense of anxiety among investors as they see the global as well as domestic economy plunging into a deep crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 9,000 and sickened lakhs of people around the globe.
 The steep decline in domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows further dampened the sentiment, they said.

 The domestic unit finally settled at 75.10 against the greenback, down 84 paise over its previous close.
 The local unit had settled at 74.26 against the greenback on Wednesday.

We are consulting with physicians treating the patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects, beyond the usual ones that limit its use in certain populations.”

According to a letter published on March 11 in the journal The Lancet, the authors had claimed without providing any data that certain drugs, including ibuprofen, increase the number of ACE2 receptors on human cells that novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) use to gain entry into epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels. The letter also said that diabetes increases the number of ACE2 receptors.
Since in theory, ibuprofen increases the number of ACE2 receptors on human cells. So patients taking the drug might be more vulnerable to infection with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The letter also said ACE-2-stimulating drugs “increase the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19”.
Letters published in any journal, The Lancet included, are not peer-reviewed. Hence, any claims made in a letter should be treated with abundant caution.

Weightlifting | Mirabai Chanu sure-shot for her second Olympics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/mirabai-chanu-sure-shot-for-her-second-olympics/article31122476.ece,"Weightlifting’s Olympic qualifying schedule has gone haywire due to the Covid-19 pandemic but India’s Mirabai Chanu is a sure-shot for the Tokyo Games, if they are held, while young Jeremy Lalrinnunga is also set to make the cut for the mega sporting spectacle.
Former World champion Mirabai currently occupies third place in the women’s 49kg world rankings following the cancellation of the Asian Championships, the last Olympics qualifying event of the continent due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Japan Olympic panel official has coronavirus 
She has taken part in five events out of the six mandated in the new qualification rules.
In a meeting of the Executive Board of the International Weightlifting Federation held on March 17-18 via video conference, the world body has made some recommendations to the International Olympic Association (IOC) regarding the Olympic qualifying events.
One of the key recommendations, sources said, may close the qualification process as all the five continental championships were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This would mean the Olympics qualification slots will be decided based on the current world rankings. The IOC will, however, take a final call on the recommendations of the International Weightlifting Federation.
“Mirabai is certain to the qualify for the Olympics, she is currently at third spot in the world rankings. The top eight from the world rankings after the end of the qualification period automatically qualifies for Tokyo Olympics,” Indian Weightlifting Federation secretary-general Sahdev Yadav said.
“She has competed in five qualifying events but the sixth one, the Asian Championships in Tashkent was cancelled. I think there will be no more qualifying events and the world rankings is set to be based on what it currently is.”
Under the new rules, to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, a weightlifter must compete in at least one event in each of the three periods of six months (spread over November 2018 to April 2020), at least six events overall and in at least one gold and silver-level event.
The 25-year-old Mirabai has now collected 3869 Robi points — the IWF’s official calculation method — to be placed third behind Hou Zhihui (4703) of China and Ri Song Gum (4209) of North Korea.
Regarding the 17-year-old Jeremy (men’s 67kg), who won a gold in 62kg in the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, Sahdev said, “In the Olympics, there will be 14 competitors in each weight category, men and women. Besides the top eight from the world rankings, the top ranker from each of the five continents will also qualify. Jeremy is at the top of Asian rankings and if the international federation’s recommendations are accepted by the IOC, he will also qualify.”
Jeremy is at the top of Asian rankings with 3119 Robi points, far ahead of second-placed Mohammed Almazyadi Nawaf (2672) from Saudi Arabia. He is set for his maiden Olympics.
The last slot will be from the host country, if that country (Japan) has not qualified from this method. But if a weightlifter from the host country has qualified, the last slot will be given through the tripartite commission process.",other sports
"NRAI postpones Olympic selection panel meeting, coaching camps ",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nrai-postpones-olympic-selection-panel-meeting-coaching-camps/article31122422.ece,"The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) has postponed the Olympic selection committee meeting which was scheduled for Friday.
With the growing uncertainty triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, the NRAI also decided to postpone all the coaching camps scheduled for April.
“We urge all Olympics-bound shooters and national coaches to refrain from coming to the range till further notice, and request that they continue with their respective training schedules from their home base, as best as they can,” said the president of the NRAI, Raninder Singh, in a statement.
Requesting the senior coaches to refrain from travel, the NRAI president urged the shooting fraternity to not lose focus on the main goal of best performance in the Olympics in Tokyo, as and when it was held.
With 15 shooters having qualified for the Olympics, the original plan was to announce the Olympic team after the World Cup in Delhi, which has subsequently been postponed to May.
In an attempt to compensate for the requisite scores, the NRAI went ahead and conducted the selection trials for all the Olympic qualified shooters. 
Even though most of the shooters would comfortably be holding on to their Olympic quota that they had won in the World Championship, World Cups and the Asian Championship, there could be some suspense in a couple of events, as to who would be chosen by the national federation to represent the country in the Olympics.
With the situation fluid, the NRAI realised that there was no urgency to finalise the Olympic team, as the world of sports had been compelled to face weeks of inaction, owing to the global concern for everyone’s health.
Meanwhile, the public dealings at the NRAI House in Tughlakabad have also been stopped till the end of the month. 
 It has been stated that no visitors would be allowed at the shooting headquarters, and senior NRAI officials would work from home.",other sports

The American lost, as his second-seeded Chinese rival finally was able to post a point.
Ding had lost both his previous games and looked worried when Caruana, playing the black side of a Slav Defence, sacrificed two pawns. The top seed succeeded in sowing doubts in his opponent's mind with his novelty on the ninth move. Ding had fallen behind the clock by about an hour after 20 moves.
But, soon he found that Caruana had little compensation for the two pawns. Black then gave up a knight for two pawns, on the 35th move, but he was clearly losing. He resigned seven moves later.

Food+travel and comedy are good distractions. Learn: The MIT lecture, ‘How To Speak by Patrick Winston’. It is amazing. Also, the sound of chalk on blackboard is really soothing! Listen: Nischay has a playlist, P&S Top Picks, on Spotify — everything here sounds really good. Read: Anything that appeals to your interests, but doesn’t excite or disturb you overmuch. Good writing, like good sound, can be inherently soothing.

Catch Don’t be that Guy (my comedy special on Amazon Prime Video), The Most Important Person in the Room (my soon-to-be-released Netflix special), and Bahubali part 1 and 2! And play Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Need for Speed Heat. They are so immersive, they help while away time effortlessly. My comfort viewing is usually classic Hollywood films from the ’80s and ’90s that I grew up with. I recently binged the Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, and Matrix series. I love watching older specials like Dave Chappelle’s Killin’’Them Softly. My favourite go-to platform is YouTube. From when I was 17, I love watching videos of all genres; it is how I learned my skills! I am also reading Creativity, Inc by Ed Catmull.

Most folks I know have way too many shows they need to catch up on. But if you are that rare human who is being confronted with free time for the first time, here is how you can do some quarantimepass. Exercise: while this is what I like to do least, I’m using this forced confinement to build the disciple muscle. Yoga is my weapon of choice. Try ‘Yoga for Beginners’, a free app (my favourite kind) and the routines can be short and sweet or longer and sweatier. It is up to you. Watch: I’ve just binged two shows on Netflix. After Life, the most darkly hilarious take on death [OK, I know that perhaps a show about death isn’t the best recco at a time like this, but if we are going to die then you really wouldn’t want to miss this], and The IT Crowd [it is so well done that even if you are as far from an IT nerd as it gets, you will find yourself fully identifying with everything that happens]. Listen/Watch: I am slightly obsessed with Hollywood gossip. I am pathetic. Why do you think I outted that whole ‘do yoga’ business up front! YouTube houses my beloved Wendy Williams and Heather MacDonald. Wendy has a TV show, but they stream long segments. Same for Heather’s podcast, Juicy Scoop. Both women are hilarious and give you their unfiltered take on stupid Hollywood celebrity behaviour. Our Bollywood celebs would never behave that badly.
 







Manoj Bajpayee, actor: I watched ‘The Irishman’ twice. ‘Fleabag’ is a must for all, just to see the brilliance of every department, all in sync. Its a great series to catch while you are isolated.







Santosh Sivan, cinematographer-filmmaker: I am all alone in Mumbai feeding fish in the aquarium at home, doing terrace gardening, reading and browsing. Watch the web series, ‘Abstract: The Art of Design’ on Netflix.







Taapsee Pannu, actor: I rarely watch films multiple times; I feel you’re wasting time when there are so many new ones you can watch. My advice to the homebound: watch ‘Homeland’.







Adil Hussain, actor: I’m watching films and shows [many recommended by friends] on OTT platforms. I found the documentaries ‘Dirty Money’ and ‘The Bleeding Edge’ very revealing. I’m also working my way through a hard drive with films curated by my acting teacher in Pondicherry. I saw this wonderful Chinese film from 2013, The Nightingale, directed by Philippe Muyl. I think Mubi has some wonderfully-curated films.







Twinkle Khanna, actor-author-columnist: I am reading books based on movies and then watching the movie with my family. We are watching ‘Electric Dreams’ on Amazon Prime Video and I am rereading an anthology by Philip K Dick. 






Ankur Tewari, singer-songwriter: Right now, I’m playing a lot of ‘Last of Us’, a zombie killing game in a post-apocalyptic world, because it is similar to what’s happening outside. I also suggest playing ‘FIFA’ because it is such a social game; you can play it online with your friends. I’m reading Leonard Cohen’s ‘The Flame’, compiled by his son Adam — a collection of his poems, some of which have been made into songs. 






Alicia Dsouza, Illustrator: 1) Salt, Fat, Heat, Acid: Based on Samin Nosrat’s best-selling book, the show premiered on Netflix in October 2018. ""It's my favourite food show."" 2) Pushpavali: The second season of Sumukhi Suresh's show is out (on Amazon Prime). ""I know and love the characters.""
3) Peep Show: The series follows the lives of Mark Corrigan and Jeremy ""Jez"" Usborne, two dysfunctional friends who share a flat in London. It's my favourite British comedy.







Anurag Kashyap, filmmaker: Watch ‘Succession’ on Hotstar. Revisit ‘Watchmen’ and ‘Breaking Bad’, as well as the entire body of work from your favourite directors.

It is beautiful filmmaking.

Raghu Dixit, indie musician: Watch Kannada movie ‘Love Mocktail’ — because I have made interesting music in it. ‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ has a simple storyline made powerful by incredible acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon. 






Rajiv Menon, director: This time has given me a chance to catch up on fiction books. I just finished ‘A Man Called Ove’ by Fredrik Backman. Apart from Carnatic music, I’ve been listening to ‘The Planets’ [a seven-movement orchestral suite] by English composer Gustav Holst. From the UK Top 40, my picks are ‘Blinding Lights’ by The Weeknd and the new James Bond track, ‘No Time to Die’, by Billie Eilish.







Rasika Dugal, actor: Having just finished ‘The Spy’, I’m now watching ‘Unbelievable’. I would recommend ‘I Lost My Body’, a drama/fantasy animation film. Beautifully scripted and skilfully visualised, it takes you through a journey of loneliness and love in a city. 






Richa Chadha, actor: I’m watching everything I think I should catch up on and some releases that I missed, like the Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer ‘Dream Girl’ and director Rohena Gera’s ‘Sir’. I’m also watching ‘High Maintenance’ on Hotstar, though I’m a little late to the party. I am also reading a book by [Serbian political activist] Srdja Popovic called ‘Blueprint for Revolution’, which is about laughter and activism.

Right now, I’m playing a lot of Last of Us, a zombie killing game in a post-apocalyptic world, because it is similar to what’s happening outside. I also suggest playing FIFA because it is such a social game; you can play it online with your friends. This is a great time to read books. I usually pick up non-fiction, and William Dalrymple’s Anarchy is a great one to keep you away from screens and social media where there’s a lot of half-baked information and hysteria. I’m reading Leonard Cohen’s The Flame, compiled by his son Adam — a collection of his poems, some of which have been made into songs. I’ve also been making playlists and old-school mix tapes, and sending them to friends [I did a deep dive into the ’80s for a friend’s birthday]. And live jams on Instagram.







Appupen, graphic artist
When I am not well, I want to read Bone, the American comic book series by Jeff Smith. It is the most comfort I can think of. It has some darkness but it is also a fantasy, an epic kind of thing. I also enjoy anything by Mœbius [the pseudonym used by French artist, cartoonist and writer, Jean Henri Gaston Giraud]. Visually, it is the best parallel universe or escape fantasy. He has the key to that other world where I try to go. Finally, there are films by Rolf de Heer, the Dutch Australian filmmaker. It is beautiful filmmaking.

There’s something about those feel-good 90s films such as Forrest Gump, Cast Away, You’ve Got Mail, and Home Alone. When you watch them, you feel like a kid again. There’s a show called Community, by the creator of Rick and Morty. It was super niche [every episode was a different genre] and hilarious, and something that people need now. At times you want an escape, just like The Office. This is also a good time to catch up on quality music. Some of my favourite tracks include ‘A little bit like magic’ by King Harvest [it reminds you that the world is not such a bad place], ‘Lovely Day’ by Bill Withers [a great morning song], and ‘A satisfied mind’ by Bobby Hebb [tells you to enjoy the simple things in life].

I’ve been spending time with my family for the last two weeks. I’ve watched Love Mocktail on Amazon Prime Video. It is a hit Kannada film and I have made interesting music in it. Ayyappanum Koshiyum is another one. It has a simple storyline made powerful by incredible acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon. A good series is Mindhunter on Netflix, one of the best psychological investigative thrillers around. Heal is a documentary (on Netflix), if you need something to inspire you in troubled times as this. And finally, there is Punch Brothers - Live at Paramount Theatre on YouTube. One of the best live acts, it is a stimulating concert video by a great band performing live.







Jaya Jaitly, activist
I have been watching Dirty Money on Netflix. It has got me thinking how so much of what is wrong in the world, including the way we’re suffering now, is about the loss or the desire for money. Surely it is time to rejig our minds and our priorities. Vikram Sampath gave me his new book, Savarkar. There has been so much opposition to it by people who have not read it – it’s only archival material; they’re not taking anyone’s side. It’s just fact and we should know the facts before we take decisions or form opinions. I went to a lit fest recently, and the whole audience was not even prepared to even think about looking at it objectively. I don’t like that sort of thing, so I’m reading that now.

I’m watching Salt, Fat, Heat, Acid, the Netflix show based on Samin Nosrat’s best-selling book. It is my favourite food show. The second season of Sumukhi Suresh's Pushpavali is out on Amazon Prime Video. I know and love the characters. And there is Peep Show. The series follows the lives of Mark Corrigan and Jeremy ‘Jez’ Usborne, two dysfunctional friends who share a flat in London. It is my favourite British comedy.",entertainment
The living room edit: A social distancing to-do list curated by the film fraternity,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/the-living-room-edit-a-social-distancing-to-do-list-curated-by-the-film-fraternity/article31119450.ece,"They say, rules are meant to be broken. We say, don’t. For some, the suddenly-imposed social distancing has a strange way of playing mind games. Misanthropes may get a strong urge to party, children and parents may drive each other up the wall. But while seclusion, and the uncertainty about coronavirus, could take a toll on our mental health — loneliness, anxiety about the future, concern for loved ones — it can also be a time to rediscover simple pleasures. Creative people across the world are sharing how self-isolation needn’t be all bad; they do it all the time, to introspect, learn, create. And they are extending a helping hand, curating what we could try in the days to come to keep our sanity and sense of self intact.

The living room edit: Indian artistes on how to social distance and chill








Naseeruddin Shah, actor-filmmaker
I’ve been catching up with the Anthony Burgess books I haven’t yet read. There are few better writers of the English language; I’d suggest giving him and Bernard Shaw a try. Read and spend time with the family rather than binge-watching some series. I’ve also been [brushing up on] Urdu poetry and teaching myself to read and write the script since it is time [approaching three score and ten and possibly Alzheimer’s!] that one must learn something new.







Adil Hussain, actor
With shoots cancelled, I’m mostly watching films at home. I spend most of my free time reading pending scripts. I’m watching films and shows [many recommended by friends] on OTT platforms. Succession; Nadine Labaki’s Capernaum; The Loudest Voice on the CEO of Fox News, Roger Ailes — it has Russell Crowe in a fantastic performance after Beautiful Mind. I found the documentaries Dirty Money and The Bleeding Edge very revealing. I’m also working my way through a hard drive with films curated by my acting teacher in Pondicherry. I saw this wonderful Chinese film from 2013, The Nightingale, directed by Philippe Muyl. I think Mubi has some wonderfully-curated films.







Twinkle Khanna, actor-author-columnist
Self isolating is not unique for people who write; I’ve had periods when I am trying to finish a manuscript. The only conundrum this time: you have a house full of people competing for the remote and desk space. I am trying to do an interesting experiment where we can all give each other space and yet do things together. So I am reading books based on movies and then watching the movie with my family. We are watching Electric Dreams on Amazon Prime Video and I am rereading an anthology by Philip K Dick. Strangely enough I never got around to reading RK Narayan’s Malgudi Days, so I am ordering a copy of Swami and Friends and then will see that on Prime as well. Since F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is part of my son’s course work, we will also watch the movie. I’ve had Satyajit Ray’s Feluda Omnibus for a while and plan to do the same [read it and then watch the adaptation], so we can all discuss it together. I am listening to podcasts like the Slate’s The Secret History of the Future while I walk my dogs. I’ve visited the Van Gogh exhibit at the Tate last year, but now want to take a virtual tour of the one in Amsterdam. A lot of museums have virtual tours, so this would be the time to travel the world of art without leaving your couch. And finally, I had signed up for a masterclass with Margaret Atwood — because I adore her — and now I may just find the time to do it.
 







Manoj Bajpayee, actor: I watched ‘The Irishman’ twice. ‘Fleabag’ is a must for all, just to see the brilliance of every department, all in sync. Its a great series to catch while you are isolated.







Santosh Sivan, cinematographer-filmmaker: I am all alone in Mumbai feeding fish in the aquarium at home, doing terrace gardening, reading and browsing. Watch the web series, ‘Abstract: The Art of Design’ on Netflix.







Taapsee Pannu, actor: I rarely watch films multiple times; I feel you’re wasting time when there are so many new ones you can watch. My advice to the homebound: watch ‘Homeland’.

Ankur Tewari, singer-songwriter: Right now, I’m playing a lot of ‘Last of Us’, a zombie killing game in a post-apocalyptic world, because it is similar to what’s happening outside. I also suggest playing ‘FIFA’ because it is such a social game; you can play it online with your friends. I’m reading Leonard Cohen’s ‘The Flame’, compiled by his son Adam — a collection of his poems, some of which have been made into songs. 






Alicia Dsouza, Illustrator: 1) Salt, Fat, Heat, Acid: Based on Samin Nosrat’s best-selling book, the show premiered on Netflix in October 2018. ""It's my favourite food show."" 2) Pushpavali: The second season of Sumukhi Suresh's show is out (on Amazon Prime). ""I know and love the characters.""
3) Peep Show: The series follows the lives of Mark Corrigan and Jeremy ""Jez"" Usborne, two dysfunctional friends who share a flat in London. It's my favourite British comedy.







Anurag Kashyap, filmmaker: Watch ‘Succession’ on Hotstar. Revisit ‘Watchmen’ and ‘Breaking Bad’, as well as the entire body of work from your favourite directors.







Appupen, graphic artist: I enjoy anything by Mœbius [the pseudonym used by French artist, cartoonist and writer, Jean Henri Gaston Giraud]. Visually, it is the best parallel universe or escape fantasy. He has the key to that other world where I try to go. Then, there are films by Rolf de Heer, the Dutch Australian filmmaker. It is beautiful filmmaking.







Bina Paul, film editor: Definitely feel-good films. Not the time to feel depressed and sad. My selection would include Hollywood classics such as ‘Casablanca’, ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’, ‘The Sting’, ‘Roman Holiday’, ‘Guess Who’s Coming for Dinner Tonight’ etc







Geetu Mohandas, actor-director: I am re-reading for the nth time Amitav Ghosh’s The Hungry Tide. He is one of my favourite authors. In addition, I am fine-tuning my script for my next film.

Jaya Jaitly: I have been watching ‘Dirty Money’ on Netflix... It has got me thinking that actually so much of what is wrong in the world, including the way we’re suffering now is about the loss or the desire for gain of money…. So much of this world is balanced on money; surely it’s time to rejig our minds and our priorities.







Kajal Aggarwal, actor: Among podcasts, I enjoy listening to [Indian American entrepreneur and investor] Naval Ravikant. I [often catch] Ted Talks and one of my favourite motivational speakers is Brene Brown (in photo). I also listen to Simon Sinek. 






Kenny Sebastian, comic: Play ‘Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order’ and ‘Need for Speed Heat’. I love watching older specials like Dave Chappelle’s ‘Killin’ Them Softly’. My favourite go-to platform is YouTube. From when I was 17, I love watching videos of all genres; it is how I learned my skills! I am also reading ‘Creativity, Inc’ by Ed Catmull.







Naveen Richard, comic: There’s something about those feel-good 90s films such as ‘Forrest Gump’, ‘Cast Away’, ‘You’ve Got Mail’, ‘Ferris Bueller’s Day Off’ and ‘Home Alone’. When you watch them, you feel like a kid again. 






Jivraj Singh of Parekh & Singh, musicians: Watch ‘Ugly Delicious’ and ‘Dave’ (Lil Dicky). Food+travel and comedy are good distractions. Nischay has a playlist, ‘P&S Top Picks’, on Spotify — everything here sounds really good. 






Radhika Vaz, comic: I’ve just binged two shows on Netflix. ‘After Life’, the most darkly hilarious take on death [OK, I know that perhaps a show about death isn’t the best recco at a time like this, but if we are going to die then you really wouldn’t want to miss this], and ‘The IT Crowd’. 






Raghu Dixit, indie musician: Watch Kannada movie ‘Love Mocktail’ — because I have made interesting music in it. ‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ has a simple storyline made powerful by incredible acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon. 






Rajiv Menon, director: This time has given me a chance to catch up on fiction books. I just finished ‘A Man Called Ove’ by Fredrik Backman. Apart from Carnatic music, I’ve been listening to ‘The Planets’ [a seven-movement orchestral suite] by English composer Gustav Holst. From the UK Top 40, my picks are ‘Blinding Lights’ by The Weeknd and the new James Bond track, ‘No Time to Die’, by Billie Eilish.







Rasika Dugal, actor: Having just finished ‘The Spy’, I’m now watching ‘Unbelievable’. I would recommend ‘I Lost My Body’, a drama/fantasy animation film. Beautifully scripted and skilfully visualised, it takes you through a journey of loneliness and love in a city. 






Richa Chadha, actor: I’m watching everything I think I should catch up on and some releases that I missed, like the Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer ‘Dream Girl’ and director Rohena Gera’s ‘Sir’. I’m also watching ‘High Maintenance’ on Hotstar, though I’m a little late to the party. I am also reading a book by [Serbian political activist] Srdja Popovic called ‘Blueprint for Revolution’, which is about laughter and activism.

Richa Chadha, actor
I’m watching everything I think I should catch up on and some releases that I missed, like the Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer Dream Girl and director Rohena Gera’s Sir. I’m also watching High Maintenance on Hotstar, though I’m a little late to the party. Like the rest of the world, I watched Contagion and now I am watching Pandemic. I am also reading a book by [Serbian political activist] Srdja Popovic called Blueprint for Revolution, which is about laughter and activism. I’m enjoying my other hobbies, too, like gardening on my balcony. I’m getting back to a lot of work I had left behind and I’m writing my book finally [on an outsider’s struggle in Bollywood]. I worked on a pitch presentation for a show last night, for something that Ali [Fazal] and I are trying to set up. Comfort film:Mr India. Read:Autobiography of a Yogi because it is about spirituality and happiness. Watch: documentaries on health, environment and sustainability like What The Health and Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret.







Rasika Dugal,actor
I’ve scheduled specific activities for myself. A running challenge — 3 km a day for 10 days. I’ve always been scared of committing to a challenge, so this is a new one for me. I am two days down, let’s see how I fare. This is in addition to my regular workout/yoga class (we might all need good immunity soon). I am starting music classes from Monday. I love singing; it calms me. I’ve also signed up for a free online course on edX — on religion, conflict and peace. With all that’s been happening in our country, I’ve felt a sense of hopelessness like never before. An academic insight into polarisation and religious conflict might help. Meanwhile, I’m cooking — the only skill I feel I imbibed genetically. I’m also reading my backlog of scripts and watching a film or a series every day. Having just finished The Spy, I’m now watching Unbelievable. I would recommend I Lost My Body, a drama/fantasy animation film. Beautifully scripted and skilfully visualised, it takes you through a journey of loneliness and love in a city. A Marriage Story is another. I think the subject [a marriage gone wrong], though fairly common, is one of the hardest to capture in cinema. Yet this film makes you feel the frustration, sadness and confusion of a failing marriage as if you are in it. And, finally, Gulon mein rang bhare. Currently on top of my list of favourites is Ali Sethi’s version (from Coke Studio season 12) of the Faiz Ahmad Faiz ghazal. Interestingly, it was written when he was in jail in Rawalpindi in 1954.







Santosh Sivan, cinematographer-filmmaker
I am all alone in Mumbai, feeding my fish, doing terrace gardening, reading and browsing. I’m watching the web series, Abstract: The Art of Design on Netflix, reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time and listening to world music.







Kajal Aggarwal, actor
Among podcasts, I enjoy listening to [Indian American entrepreneur and investor] Naval Ravikant. I love how he talks about his learnings and gives his suggestions. This confidence comes from a place of knowledge and time invested in reading. The Stuff You Should Know podcast, hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W Chuck Bryant, is super interesting. I [often catch] Ted Talks and one of my favourite motivational speakers is Brene Brown. I also listen to Simon Sinek. There are a lot more fantastic talks out there. I like listening to audio books, especially while cooking, working out [doing my cardio] or any activity that doesn’t require my 100% attention. Listening to these while completing your mundane chores is a great way to multitask and make it interesting.







Anurag Kashyap,filmmaker
You should watch nothing soppy because that will make you touch your face to wipe away the tears. Or even horror because that will also make you touch your face. I would suggest thrillers and drama: Watchmen, the series; all seasons of Breaking Bad; Succession;stand-up comics; and the entire body of work of your favourite directors.







Taapsee Pannu, actor
Honestly, I am just catching up on films that I missed watching last year and reading all the scripts [on which] I have to get back with an answer. I rarely watch films multiple times; I feel you’re wasting time when there are so many new ones you can watch. My advice to the homebound: watch Homeland.







Bina Paul, film editor
I’m watching feel-good films. It is not the time to feel depressed and sad. My selection includes Hollywood classics such as Casablanca, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, The Sting, Roman Holiday, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, etc. Then there are some really good Iranian films to binge watch — works by Majid Majidi, Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panâhi. Old Indian films are always a favourite, like Guide, Umrao Jaan and DDLJ. It is also a good time to catch some good documentaries on Netflix.







Geetu Mohandas, actor-director
I’m not someone who binge watches. I enjoy my solitude and, when I am on a break, I enjoy reading. Right now, I am re-reading for the nth time Amitav Ghosh’s The Hungry Tide. He is one of my favourite authors. At one time, I wanted to adapt his Sea of Poppies and I wrote to him in Goa. He said the rights of the book were with someone else. However, I am so happy I was able to interact with him. In addition, I am fine-tuning my script for my next film. It is in the last stages. Now that my daughter, Aradhana, is at home, my ‘me time’ is extremely limited. I have to keep her engaged. She is allowed only one hour of TV viewing. So I am really busy.







Rajiv Menon,director
I was running a writers’ room that, of course, has been put on hold. But I still come into the office to write. This time has also given me a chance to catch up on fiction books. I just finished A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman; it was light reading. Apart from Carnatic music, I’ve been listening to ‘The Planets’ [a seven-movement orchestral suite] by English composer Gustav Holst. From the UK Top 40, my picks are ‘Blinding Lights’ by The Weeknd and the new James Bond track, ‘No Time to Die’, by Billie Eilish. It is quite distinct from earlier Bond theme songs, and I like the lyrics as well. I managed to watch a couple of Malayalam movies too — Anjaam Pathiraa and Ayyappanum Koshiyum. The latter’s soundtrack was also great.







Manoj Bajpayee, actor
I am stuck in Uttarakhand as my shoot got suspended for 10 days. I’m catching up on films and TV shows. I watched The Irishman twice. It is a must for actors. I am amazed at the sheer persistence of the legends to evolve at this age. I recommend Succession. There is something about the show that is so damn exciting. Apart from the performances, it is the complications and unpredictability of the relationship that I found so intriguing. Fleabag is also a must for all, just to see the brilliance of every department, all in sync. It is a great series to catch while you are isolated.",entertainment

Kanika had travelled from London to Mumbai by the Air India flight AI130 on March 10, since there is no direct flight  from London to Lucknow. It is expected that as per GOI orders, screening would have been done at Mumbai for the singer. Passenger screening is being done for international flights only in India.
According to reports, the singer is currently at the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), where she has been kept in isolation. Kanika attended three events recently since her return: two in Lucknow and one in Kanpur, and had also thrown a party for friends and family, that was attended by politicians and socialites. Efforts are underway to trace the guests now, as well as quarantine the apartment Kanika was staying in.
According to a statement by the Lucknow District Magistrate the administration has temporarily shut down the Taj Hotel in Lucknow where Kanika stayed.
In a statement, the Taj Hotels said: “Kanika Kapoor stayed at the hotel but did not host a function or gathering at the hotel premises. The room occupied by her has been quarantined and disinfected. The staff who intersected with her have withdrawn into self-quarantine.  There have been no further symptoms or incidents reported.”",entertainment
 COVID 19: Southern film buffs more reluctant to go to the movies ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/covid-19-southern-film-buffs-more-reluctant-to-go-to-the-movies/article31112349.ece,"Film buffs in the south are far more cautious when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic than the ones in the north, a survey has shown. 
The latest State-wise figures from Ormax Media’s ongoing study of the impact of the outbreak on theatre-going behaviour show that 78% of Kerala viewers polled said they would stay away if theatres were open and a film they wanted to watch was showing. This was followed by 74% from Karnataka saying they would not go to cinema halls, while West Bengal was in the third spot with 70%, followed by Andhra Pradesh-Telangana with 63%. 
The exception to the rule in the south was Tamil Nadu, featuring 12th among 13 States polled, with 48% viewers claiming they would stay away. Uttar Pradesh stood at the very bottom, with 45% viewers saying they won’t be flocking to cinema halls because of the virus.
“While 61% viewers in Maharashtra claimed they will stay away, the percentage in Mumbai alone was relatively higher at 69%,” said Ormax CEO Shailesh Kapoor. According to him, the constant conversations on media and social media have added to the awareness of the crisis and led to a rising restraint.
The fourth in the series of surveys, conducted between March 16-18, showed a sharper spike with 58% of the country’s regular theatre-goers likely to stay away from theatres till the threat of the novel coronavirus has reduced. This was an increase from the 23% in the poll conducted between March 6 and 8, 26% in the one conducted between March 9 and 11 and 33% between March 12-15.
As many as 57% viewers in the Hindi-speaking markets said they will stay away, as opposed to 39% in the previous one and 28% and 26% in the ones before that. In the south, the rise was far more substantial — 58% said they will stay away from 30%, 21% and 17% previously.
Mr. Kapoor said things look uncertain for the industry for some months to a year. But it is getting increasingly clear that it will be one of the most crippling years for the industry in recent times. “With shoots stalled, the planned October, November, December releases are looking uncertain and will get pushed further. Some single screens were thinking of renovating in this interim, but even for that you need people.” 
According to him, even when theatres reopen, it will take at least four to eight weeks for things to get back to the normal routine. In other words, it’s a long haul ahead.",entertainment
I think it is time I launch my campaign: H.S. Doreswamy,https://www.thehindu.com/society/i-think-it-is-time-i-launch-my-campaign-hs-doreswamy/article31110267.ece,"A frail old man, a few weeks shy of 102, is keenly watching the proceedings of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on television, reclining on a cot in his modest house in South Bengaluru. H.S. Doreswamy — freedom fighter, Gandhian and civic activist — is more absorbed than usual in the cacophonous news telecast because it is him that the Assembly is discussing.
The Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka has launched a virulent attack on the centenarian, starting with a former Union minister calling him a “fake freedom fighter” who behaves like a “Pakistani agent”. Several BJP leaders have joined in, alleging that the freedom fighter was partisan because he had done the unthinkable — criticised Hindutva icon V.D. Savarkar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Despite a pushback by the Opposition for three days in the Assembly, the BJP did not budge and refused to apologise for their comments. Instead, there were more vicious attacks, even dubbing him “anti-national”.
Comfortable in khadi
Doreswamy, clad in his signature khadi dhoti and kurta, does not seem very perturbed by what he was watching on TV. 
“My life is an open book and I am confident the people will stand by me,” he says, baffled though he clearly is by the virulence of the attack. The untiring activist has been a leading voice against the CAA-NRC-NPR in the past few months. This also explains why he has been in the crosshairs of the BJP and Hindutva activists.
“Despite ideological differences, I could count many as friends in the BJP, and our arguments have been civil till now,” he says. “It is testimony to the complete intolerance of this regime to any criticism. Other critics have suffered far worse, being jailed or even killed. There is a systematic campaign to discredit and attack all voices of dissent.”
Drawing parallels with the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, he says the present regime is fast hurtling towards a situation that is far worse. 
“Now you don’t need to impose Emergency,” he says with a wry smile. “During the Emergency, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister saying the British were more magnanimous than her in dealing with political prisoners. I was arrested but the court let me off, saying that as a citizen I was free to write a letter to my Prime Minister, however critical it was,” he recounts.
What he is doing now is quite the same: exerting his rights as a citizen to be critical of government policies he thinks are disastrous. “I have called for the defeat of this regime and will continue to work towards that. It doesn’t make me anti-national. We need to differentiate between the government, the state and the nation.”
Witness to Partition
He has been a vocal critic of CAA-NRC-NPR because he believes that it not only seeks to polarise the country on religious lines, but is also antithetical to the founding principles of our nation. “I was a witness to Partition. Pakistan became a Muslim nation, we remained secular. Only a handful of Muslim families went to Pakistan from Karnataka. The Muslims here chose to be Indians. They cannot be asked to prove their citizenship now,” he says. Moreover, he believes that CAA-NRC-NPR is also a “tyranny of documentation” that is not part of the culture of a majority of Indians, and its implementation will only create chaos.
Freedom movement
The campaign against him has gone so far as to even question his age. The Opposition had to marshal documents to confirm that he had been jailed for over a year in the city in 1942 during the Quit India Movement, as proof of both his age and the fact that he indeed participated in the freedom movement. This “test” has left Doreswamy more amused than angry. “We have elected people who don’t know history, no harm telling them.”
He walks down memory lane to the early years of his association with the freedom movement. “Back then, we ensured three major textile mills in the city were shut down. These mills were preparing parachute cloth used by the Air Force. So this hit the war effor. I used to supply time bombs that were put into government record rooms to destroy records. But none were hurt,” he recounts. It was only later that he turned Gandhian in an absolute sense. He brought out a weekly, Pouravani (Citizen’s Voice), that the British banned, pushing him underground.
But post-Independence, he slowly distanced himself from the Congress and emerged as a leading voice of civil society. He was active in Vinoba Bhave’s Bhoodan Movement, the JP Movement against the Emergency and, more recently, India Against Corruption. He has also been an urban activist, fighting for Bengaluru’s lakes and sustainable solid waste management, asking the civic authorities to stop dumping waste into landfills in villages. As a result, the city got six waste processing plants in 2014. He led an effort to mainstream left-wing extremists, along with the slain editor-activist Gauri Lankesh, who often described him as a “rockstar.” He now heads a trust in her memory. He also leads a struggle that demands land for the landless.
 
Conscience of the state
Describing him as the “conscience of the state for the last 70 years,” historian Ramachandra Guha recounted how as a student in the 1980s he was part of movements for the rights of farmers and other vulnerable communities with Doreswamy. “He was already in public life for 40 years. I was inspired by him then. Now in my 60s, I am still inspired by him,” Guha said at a recent anti-CAA protest where the two shared a stage.
Doreswamy is enthused by the organic spurt of protests against CAA-NRC across the country, but cautions that unless well co-ordinated they may fizzle out. “Ideally such movements need leadership. But we have to accept there is no such leadership today even in the Opposition. This calls for more reflection, caution and strategy to ensure the movement is not misled,” he says. “Hindu-Muslim unity is key and we must not allow the regime to paint this as a ‘Muslim issue’. It is advisable that all protests have both Hindus and Muslims.” 
Meanwhile, his well-wishers have been trying to “manage him emotionally” from the double onslaught of the recent death of his wife, a companion of over 70 years, and the attacks on him by the Hindutva right. But a seemingly unaffected Doreswamy is busy thinking of his next campaign. 
“I have only participated in protests others have organised against this regime till now. I think it is time I launch my campaign. Narendra Modi has only been diverting attention from real issues. The economy is in the doldrums and there is severe unemployment. If the government doesn’t shift its focus to people’s issues by year end, I will launch a non-cooperation movement.”

Washing and bathing so often, have single-handedly run our building out of water supply. Like I care. I have to protect myself. 
Used up husband’s alcohol supply as hand sanitiser on self and child. Drank enough to sanitise my insides too. 
Child has fever. Children are carriers of Corona. Must not keep child at home and risk her infecting us. Gave her paracetamol and sent her to school. 
Do not panic, says PM. Be responsible. 
Panic, says WHO, take this seriously. Be responsible. Be smart. 
I was smart. I pretended to cough and bought up the pharmacy’s stock of masks. To be safe.
To be even safer, let me buy up rice and dal for three months at least.
What? Empty shelves? Which selfish slug has already bought up all the rice and dal that I wanted to buy up? Paranoid idiots! Let me buy up whatever is left. Toothpicks, red chillies, toilet paper. In an emergency shut down, we can eat toilet paper for the next few months. 
I sneezed today. OMG, I have only a few days to live. Or is it the red chillies? I went around hugging neighbours. Life is short, spread love.

"Empty beaches, postponed weddings, people work from home: India grapples with COVID-19",https://www.thehindu.com/society/empty-beaches-postponed-weddings-people-work-from-home-india-grapples-with-covid-19/article31116611.ece,"When wedding season begins in Delhi, starting in November and lasting till April, it’s brisk business for Simran Bedi. The enterprising beautician always has a gaggle of excited aunts, cousins, grand-aunts and brides lining up at her tiny single-storied pink salon, ready to be rouged up. This year though, her 10-year-old business has taken a beating.
The big fat Indian wedding has been hit by COVID-19, and it has dragged salons down with it. For Simran, the name of the virus has become a verb. “I have been coronaad,” she says. From making ₹6,000-10,000 a day in wedding season, Bedi’s earnings have dipped to ₹2,000.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal shut down clubs, swimming pools, gyms and malls last week, but left out weddings from his list of proscriptions, leaving it to people’s good sense to not congregate. And they seem to be listening. Not just weddings but many social activities are skidding to a halt as people themselves decide to practise ‘social distancing’, that new health mantra.
Business is bad
Social distancing might be the way to fight the virus, but it also means that businesses, big and small, are feeling the coronavirus heat. The airline industry is the worst off, with losses crossing $500 million. Without government aid, carriers say they may shut shop by May. 
Kerala’s hospitality industry is also badly struck. With business conferences, retreats and B2B meetings cancelled, room occupancy is as low as 20%. “It’s come down to one or two rooms. Our operational costs are not being met,” says Sooraj Ramakrishnan, Senior Sales Manager at Zuri Kumarakom, a five-star resort. Many hotel chains are talking of 15-30% pay cuts for upper management and unpaid leave for junior staff. 
Bengaluru’s restaurants have seen a staggering 70% decline in footfall — be it fine dining or the small darshinis. “The impact is going to be long-lasting and deep,” says Manu Chandra, the proprietor of several restaurants and Bengaluru Chapter Head, National Restaurant Association of India. “Hospitality depends on daily transactions to break even. Human resources and rentals are our highest costs. If this crisis doesn’t abate soon, we could be looking at closures and layoffs.”

But it’s those on the lowest rungs who might suffer the most. Birender Yadav is a spot boy from Mumbai’s Juhu Koliwada, a daily wage earner whose earnings have stopped because Bollywood has stopped shootings. “Ghar par hain. Shooting ruk jaane se ghar ka kiraya to nahin ruk jaata. Gareeb log kya khayenge, bachche kaise paalenge? (I am stuck at home. The shooting is stalled but we still have to pay rent. How will the poor eat, feed kids?)” he says. Yadav was working on Hungama 2. He makes ₹1,500-1,800 a day for a 15-16 hour shift. He hopes the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) will do something to help members.
With commutes dropping sharply, thousands of cab drivers just can’t make ends meets. And, as of Thursday, aggregator companies did not have any compensation plan in place. In other sectors too, companies are laying off people or sending them on unpaid leave. Without a vaccine in sight yet, things are beginning to look grim. 
All shut down
Shows, movies, malls, gyms, pools, zoos, amusement parks — they are all closed. Says Mumbai-based comedian Kajol Srinivasan, “All corporate gigs have been cancelled — the OML circuit comedy fest, the Pune Comedy Festival 4.0, all cancelled. And most producers have shut open mics until March 31.” Srinivasan has turned to designing to make money. How is she coping? “I am trying to write,” she says, “but mostly making gloomy calls to other comedians. And oh, I made orange marmalade, I am so bored.” 
People have begun self-isolating. They have begun to call off addas, birthdays, gym and yoga classes. “I decided to stay away from yoga class today as it was pranayama day, which involves inhaling and exhaling air,” says Nirupa, who lives in a gated community in ATS Society in Delhi’s Indirapuram. She has just received a residents WhatsApp alert that the society gym and club have also closed. Her housing society plans to get infra-red thermometers to screen visitors. 
Many complexes in Chennai and Bengaluru have already acquired these. Even though its efficacy is disputed, it’s being wielded faithfully everywhere — outside gyms, gated communities, office buildings, even Parliament.
In the heart of New Delhi is the sprawling Lodhi Gardens, a 15th-century legacy of the Lodhi dynasty, which doubles up as the capital’s green lung. Young couples can always be found here, romancing under the trees, oblivious to the walkers and runners around them. But Corona has frightened them away, and only a few couples can be seen now. 
The famous middle-class mantra of shaping up for summer has also been put on hold. But Chirag Khurana of Anytime Fitness club, with its 45 centres around Delhi, has not given up. His 32,000 members have paid steep annual fees ranging from ₹28,000 to ₹50,000, and he has plans to e-mail them fitness tips, balanced diets and more. “We are not even looking at how the closure will impact business right now. Who knows, we may open by end-March,” he says with optimism, adding, “After this phase is over, more people might become health conscious.”

Cities are shutting down one after another. Even Mumbai, nonchalant till last weekend, got cautious. As the number of patients reached 48 in Maharashtra on Thursday, its jam-packed trains, metros and stations are no longer so full. Marine Drive is finally deserted, and restaurants have begun to down shutters.
Although Chennai’s malls, cinemas and shopping districts are shut, it is otherwise looking normal. Bengaluru seems more circumspect, with people staying off the streets. The railway station in Kerala’s capital wears a deserted look. In Kochi, we saw a deliveryman waiting outside the gate, hands resting on the bars. The lady of the house came out, took the package, then started wiping the gate down to sanitise it. This scene has quickly become a part of daily life.
In Pune, a retired Army officer says they have “stocked medicines, hygiene supplies, a month’s dry rations and drawn cash to prepare for coronavirus.” With 50-plus members and two cancer patients in his family, “we are proactively social distancing,” he says. “No visits except the most essential and we have stopped the domestic help too.” Even the protesting women of Shaheen Bagh have decided to limit their numbers at the protest site and take all the precautions prescribed by the Ministry of Health.
Panic stations
The bigger crisis right now seems to be panic. People have begun to stockpile: flour, rice, lentils, milk and medicines. Many stores are seeing empty shelves as people prepare to stay indoors. BigBasket’s website says deliveries will be delayed as there’s “an unprecedented increase in demand”. Grofers says “average ticket sizes are way higher than normal,” and warns customers that “excessive buying or multiple orders to bypass inventory limit can lead to order cancellation.” 
Hand sanitisers and masks are in great demand even though medical advisers have repeatedly said that soap and water is a better cleanser. Both have vanished from shelves, despite the government requesting people not to hoard. A ₹100 pack of hand wipes sells for ₹190 in Mumbai while in Kochi, masks were ₹18 apiece. In Tamil Nadu, the Health Ministry issued notices to shops warning them against selling masks, sanitisers and thermometers at higher prices.
Stay home
“Mass work from home — this is uncharted territory,” says Amit Hardi, CEO of Bengaluru-based gaming firm Nukebox Studios. He began working from home this week, converting his guest bedroom into a home office. His colleagues are doing the same. “The dynamics will evolve over time, but we have no choice but to make this work for now,” he says.
Many offices along Chennai’s IT Expressway have declared work-from-home, with some firms insisting their employees sit in front of videocams as proof of working!

This might have an unexpected fallout. As more people stay home, infrastructure in these suburbs is likely to be hit hard. Residential complexes are worrying about how many more water tankers they have to order and how much oftener the sewage trucks have to come by.
With schools and colleges shut, people are trying to “reinvent family time”. Ranju B. in Bengaluru has ordered home several board games; the old dusty carrom board has been brought out, while some families say they are gardening together. People gather in fours and fives for yoga or dance and music lessons, while parents struggle to keep young kids engaged. Streaming services are in high demand, as are online schooling resources, virtual museums and operas, and free online Ivy League courses. Is the virus going to lead to deeper bonds being forged between family members?
Gods must be careful
The pandemic is changing how people pray. In Mumbai, the hugely popular Siddhivinayak and Mumbadevi temples have shut their doors. March is festival season in Kerala but temples, including Sabarimala, have cancelled cultural programmes and feasts, holding only rituals. Even the hugely popular Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati has been shut down, but Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has allowed Ram Navami celebrations in Ayodhya to go ahead.
Mosques are asking the faithful to pray from home; while some worshippers are coming to prayer in masks. It is Lent, but many Kerala parishes have cancelled daily prayers and religious heads are asking devotees to pray from home. Some churches have cancelled confessions, holy communion, and blessings by hand. 
“Last Sunday, our priest forbade touching or kissing statues and the cross,” says Nitin Antony Francis, an entrepreneur in Kochi. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India has sent out a list of dos and don’ts, which includes asking people to make the sign of peace with folded hands, to not kiss the cross on Good Friday, and for priests to dip their hands in  sanitiser before holy communion. 
Funny side up
As virus fears get stronger, governments are getting tougher against people who break rules. In Pune, a case was registered against the father of a young woman who encouraged his daughter to escape quarantine. In Kerala, when Bigg Boss contestant Rajith Kumar’s fans thronged Kochi airport on March 15 to welcome him, the police filed cases against 79 of them, including against Kumar. 
But every depressing story has a silver lining. And nothing breaks the ice like the irrepressible Rakhi Sawant’s Twitter video imploring all the gods she knows to halt the virus in its tracks. Corona memes and COVID-19 jokes are at their best. Sex isn’t being ignored either, as people circulate images of complicated positions where face-to-face contact can be avoided during the act, and social media asks people to stockpile copies of the Kamasutra.
As India prepares to hunker down and wait for the virus to reach its expiry date, perhaps people might turn to books, writing and old-fashioned friendships? Life as we know it might have come to a halt but it’s certainly not at an end. Who knows, this sense of an ending might also herald a year of magical thinking.

SEBI steps in to tackle volatility,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-steps-in-to-tackle-volatility/article31122261.ece,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India has raised the margins in the cash segment while tightening norms for position limits in derivatives, as volatility continues to rise in the stock market. 
 The aim was to ensure effective risk management and market integrity, a statement said. The marketwide position limit in certain stocks in derivatives has been revised to 50% and the penalty on an entity found to exceed permissible limits has been enhanced to 10 times of the current minimum and five times of the maximum penalty structure.
Further, for stocks with a price band of 20% and witnessing an intra day (high-low) price movement of more than 10% for three or more days in the last one month, the minimum margin rate would be increased to 40% in a phased manner. 
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds among others will be allowed to take short positions in index derivatives only to the extent of the notional value of their holding in the underlying stocks.
“Unlike most markets where short-selling was banned to curb speculation as a fallout of COVID-19, SEBI has prudently restricted market-wide position through this initiative,” said Ajay Kejriwal, president, Choice Broking.
“With increase in margins for cash segments in selective stocks, it will also reduce the volumes in the market and ensure less leverage and volatility for an investor worthy market which in recent times had seen India VIX at the highest level since the 2008,” he added.",business

The announcement comes amid the outbreak of COVID-19. “At the Tata Group, we have asked all of our companies to exercise extreme caution. The health and safety of our employees, their families and our suppliers, vendors and our larger ecosystem is of paramount importance. 
“Our companies have largely enabled a ‘work from home’ (WFH) environment,” said a statement from Tata Sons, adding the group has asked its companies in India to rapidly and extensively adopt WFH to ensure that the employees travel only in the most essential cases, excluding situations in which they are involved in the delivery of products and services for the larger public good. 
The current situation is likely to have a large and deep financial impact on the weaker socio-economic segments of the society. 
“During this time of crisis, our group companies commit to ensuring full payments to the temporary workers and daily wage earners who are working in our offices and at our sites in India for the months of March and April, 2020, even if these workers are not able to work due to either quarantine measures, site closures, plant shutdowns or other reasons,” said the statement.
The other segment of particular focus is the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector. 
“Our group companies follow a policy of making timely payments of legitimate dues. Under the current situation, we will monitor this closely to ensure that such dues are paid on an immediate basis in order to provide liquidity,” said the statement.

“A significant 53% of Indian businesses indicate the marked impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations even at early stages,” the survey, which saw participation from 317 companies between March 15-19, 2020, said. Almost three-fourth of the businesses indicated big reductions in orders. “Of these, almost 50% indicated a 20% and more decrease in the orders,” it said. 
Likewise, almost 80% of companies reported a decrease in cash flow, with more than 40% respondents reporting a fall of 20% or more in cash flows. Asked about the expected time for normalcy to return, 45.21% respondents said it would take six months, while 42.47% expected it in three months.

"Egg, broiler prices slump as virus fears take heavy toll on sector",https://www.thehindu.com/business/egg-broiler-prices-slump-as-virus-fears-take-heavy-toll-on-sector/article31122209.ece,"Chicken prices have crashed from ₹90 a kg last month to ₹20 in Mumbai, as retail buyers are staying away from consuming poultry for fear of the COVID-19 disease.
Despite several awareness campaigns to demolish misconceptions that poultry had something to do with the dreaded virus, people are still steering clear of chicken.
Poultry companies listed on the exchanges, such as Venky’s (India) Ltd and Simran Firms Ltd (SFL) are likely to report lower revenues this quarter as business has suffered. “Poultry prices are at all time low. Ex-farm broiler price is ₹10-15 per kg ( cost of production is ₹75 per kg) and egg prices are ₹1.5 per egg ex-farm (cost of production is ₹3.50 per egg). 
Due to reduction in chicken and egg production, feed demand and prices are coming down on daily basis. The price of the main raw materia, like corn and soyabean meal, have dropped more than 10% over the last 2 weeks,” said a spokesperson for Godrej Agrovet Ltd. 
As per a previous estimate, the poultry trade in Maharashtra was losing more than ₹10 crore a day due to lack of appetite for chicken.
“Though there is no direct link between chicken and the virus, people will stay away from poultry as long as the fear is there. It will impact poultry firms like Venky’s and SFL and any other company linked to this business. In this quarter, their revenues will be lower and the trend has been reflected in their share prices on account of this direct impact,” said Ambareesh Baliga, independent equity analyst.
Poultry farmers are bearing the brunt due to the price crash. “The business has collapsed. Now, prices have crashed to ₹20 a kg. Earlier, I used to sell 150 birds day, now it has come down to a dozen,” said Salim Momin, a poultry dealer from Lalbaug, Mumbai. 
In Tamil Nadu, which produces nearly one crore broiler chicken a week, the industry is badly hit.
“The broiler sector in the State has suffered nearly ₹600 crore loss in the last one month,” said R. Lakshmanan, MD of Shanthi Feeds and president of Broiler Coordination Committee. 
He told The Hindu that the farmgate price for broiler in Tamil Nadu was fixed at ₹15-₹20 a kg on Thursday and ₹25-₹30 a kg on Friday. “The prices went to almost nil level and are reviving for the last two days. Retail off-take is improving now,” he said. 
The poultry sector has appealed to the Centre for restructuring of bank loans, moratorium for a year and interest subvention support. “We fear the industry will lose sustainability if there is no support from the government,” Mr. Lakshmanan said. 
Prices of eggs have also seen a decline.
P. Selvaraj, zonal chairman of the National Egg Coordination Committee, Namakkal, said egg prices had slumped to ₹1.25 each (farm gate price). “We fixed the price at ₹2 an egg. The actual price at which it is sold by farms is ₹1.25,” he said. The normal farmgate price at this time of the year used to be ₹3.50-₹3.60. Tamil Nadu produces nearly three crore eggs daily. Eggs are also supplied to Kerala, Bengaluru and in winter, to north India as well. With the virus impact, “there is a daily loss of nearly ₹7.5 crore,” he said. Farmers have reduced production from 3.5 crore eggs to 3 crore. They have stock worth ₹15 crore, he said.
Prices of maize that goes into making poultry feed has reduced significantly. 
Grain merchant Devendra Vora, proprietor, Friendship Brokers, APMC Market, Navi Mumbai, said maize prices have been falling over the last 2-3 months. 
“Since demand for poultry feed has come down, maize prices have suffered. Due to the coronavirus effect, prices have fallen to ₹1,500-₹1,600 per 100 kg from ₹1,900 in January.”",business

"The romantic idealism of 'Moneyball', the pre-eminent sports movie of our times",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-romantic-idealism-of-moneyball/article31121176.ece,"At its core, sport is the celebration of physical traditionalism. Primal instincts like survival, speed, endurance, athleticism and courage become tangible traits under the guise of entertainment. Consequently, like any visual medium, sport becomes an inherent endorsement of beauty over mechanics. We admire winners who turn sport into a science of technical efficiency: Modern-day Australian cricket teams, Cristiano Ronaldo, Novak Djokovic, Michael Schumacher. They make domination look mundane. But we adore winners who turn sport into an art of irresistible naturalism: West Indian cricket teams of yore, Lionel Messi, Roger Federer, Ayrton Senna. They make domination feel memorable.

 In context of storytelling, these two schools of style are mutually exclusive: Raw oldness is the heroic underdog, while slick newness is the impersonal antagonist. Which is why I believe Moneyball is the pre-eminent sports movie of our times. On the face of it, Bennett Miller’s Moneyball, based on Michael Lewis’s non-fiction book, examines the technological transformation of baseball at the turn of the century. 
The two protagonists, Oakland Athletics’ General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), would have been the soulless anti-heroes of any other sports film. They use sophisticated sabermetrics. They disregard scouts’ intuitive experiences. They ditch high-profile players. They turn winning into dry math.
Trouble with the Curve released a year after Moneyball, starring Clint Eastwood as an aging baseball scout in an age of tech-savvy young managers. Eastwood wins with old-fashioned instinct against Matthew Lillard, the film’s corporate newbie. In other words, Moneyball’s Beane and Brand desensitise a sport – stripping it off flourish, fluidity, subjectivity – by reducing it to advanced analytics. Yet, this biographical baseball drama subverts the underdog formula by presenting digital pragmatism as the unlikely hero and paperback sentimentalism as the default setting. Beane is in fact the one engulfed by a stubborn system – an arrogant head scout, skeptical CEO, cynical coach, distrusting players.

 But this isn’t to say idealists are the bad guys. A distinct feature of Moneyball is its elusive balance between the two incompatible schools of style. The story might be a rare endorsement of science in sport, but art informs its filmmaking. For instance, the central music theme (The Mighty Rio Grande) isn’t a conventional sports score: It evokes the wistfulness of memory, of the future becoming history in real time. It suggests that Billy Beane is an incurable romantic. He is driven by chafed affection, by superstition, by the prospect of transcending logic. The understated personality of Moneyball thrives on this paradox – of the old guard updating a purist’s passion. Necessity is the mother of invention. But in Beane’s case, heartbreak is the father of invention. His love – of family (divorced), baseball (scouts ruined his playing career), competition (crippled by budget) – has failed him over the years. Almost reactively, he hires the epitome of reasoning: an Economics graduate for whom science is simply an elevated form of art.
Moneyball’s Peter Brand is emblematic of modern sport’s robotisation. The game is an academic project for him. But the film’s finest scenes have the two men silently feeding off one another. Brand’s calculative head shows signs of Beane’s heartbeat when he celebrates – with a comical fist-pump – on securing a last-gasp transfer deal. 
Brand even agrees to engage with the players, and fire them in person. Only in a late scene does he reveal himself as a modified pragmatist. He shows Beane the footage of an obese hitter tumbling at base before realising his shot is a home run. Brand’s nostalgic narration breaks character, eventually prompting the older man to remember his own love: “How can you not be romantic about baseball?”.

 Beane, too, evidently adopts some of Brand’s cold objectivity. On the cusp of a record streak, Billy Beane breaks his no-game-watching protocol and drives back to the stadium. (The camera continues in his lane even as he abandons it). The team blows a 11-0 lead. The winning play, however, is a hypnotic combination of Beane’s romanticism and Brand’s realism. The coach overrules his own instinct to bat Hatteberg, an undervalued sabermetrics pick. At first glance, Hatteberg scoring looks like a Brand moment – a mathematically inevitable shot. But Beane’s idealism defines it: seconds earlier, Beane left the stands to unjinx the game. Moreover, the home run came from a defensive first-baseman – against strategy, wisdom and...science.
Mundanity is usually sacrificed at the altar of a miracle. But the miracle of Moneyball, like the team it reflects, is merely a sum of tangible mundanities. The Athletics lose the playoffs, because both men eventually resist getting consumed by method; they retain a glimmer of madness. The film closes with Beane on the freeway, contemplating the fickleness of sport. He plays a tape of his daughter’s song. Here’s a die-hard romantic who hates losing, but has lost plenty without shedding a tear. Yet, it’s only when the girl’s unblemished voice breaks into an extra verse of “You’re such a loser, dad,” his eyes finally go glassy. With proud tears. How can you not be romantic about filmmaking?",movies

Even when there isn’t a shoot, I prefer being at home, except for perhaps stepping out to watch a movie. For me, cinema is the best way to unwind. Right now, I have a long list of movies on my to-watch list. A few are on my computer and the rest from Netflix and Amazon Prime. I enjoy films of all genres and can’t wait to see those that have won recognition at film festivals. Another activity that keeps me occupied is sketching. That has always been my favourite pastime, even during breaks on shooting sets. I think it was a welcome move to halt shootings because if one person gets infected, it affects a lot of other people too.

I cook, which I love to do, I work out, I play board games with my daughter, nephews and nieces, I read books, watch movies on OTT platforms, feed my pets, help my family in household work… I now get to spend more time with my family, which is kind of rare in our line of work. I am ensuring social distancing so that I don’t get the virus from someone and spread it. We have stood together as a community, supporting each other, whenever there was a crisis. I hope we will overcome this one as well.
Martin Prakkat
Just five days were left to wind up the shoot of my untitled movie starring Kunchacko Boban, Joju George and Nimisha Sajayan when we reached Kochi after finishing a smooth schedule in Kodaikanal. Since the remaining scenes were to be shot with a crowd featuring junior artistes, we felt that it was better to stop the work because these artistes were to come from different parts of Kerala. However, the editing of the film is on since the scenes were filmed in the same order as they appear in the movie. I am also working on a film that I am producing with a new director at the helm. Otherwise, I am mostly at my home in Changanassery, spending time with my daughter. We even go for a bike ride at times!

I am finishing the post-production work of Sajan Bakery Since 1962, which I have scripted as well. That is the only thing that we can do now until we get back to work again. We had planned to release the film after Vishu, which would seem to be difficult in the current scenario. I am also part of Tsunami and Minnal Murali, which is still in production. As for family time, I always find time for them, whether there is Coronavirus or not!

We were shooting for Lalitham Sundaram. I am more involved in family matters now and step out only if there is an emergency. Now, I also have the time to listen to new scripts, some of which have been pending for long. Then there is television to keep myself entertained. It is a good decision to stop shootings. After all, it is for a common cause because the next few days are going to be crucial in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus.

I am a movie buff and have a list of films that I plan to watch on the OTT platforms. Another task I have undertaken is to clean my house and remove all the clutter! I am also taking care of my health and giving myself the rest I deserve. I was acting in my debut Tamil film, Karnan, opposite Dhanush when it was decided to stop shootings. Nobody knows what is going to happen. The best thing I can do now is stay at home as much as possible.
Waiting list
Among the films that have been halted are Madhu Warrier’s Lalitham Sundaram, starring Biju Menon and Manju Warrier; Martin Prakkat’s untitled film; Lal Jr’s Tsunami and Basil Joseph’s Minnal Murali. While the release of Mohanlal’s Marakkar- Arabikkadalinte Simham and Tovino’s Kilometers and Kilometers have been postponed, Aju Varghese’s Sajan Bakery Since 1962 and Mahesh Narayanan’s Malik will have to push their release dates. Other upcoming releases are One, Kunjeldo, Mohankumar Fans, Halal Love Story and Keshu E Veedinte Nadhan.

"'The Outsider' review: Extensively-plotted, emotionally-layered, and keeps you hooked till the end",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-outsider-review-extensively-plotted-emotionally-layered-and-keeps-you-hooked-till-the-end/article31117869.ece,"It mustn’t be easy to sell the “slow-burn procedural unfolding against the backdrop of a shocking murder in a small town” pitch to a TV audience any more, and so it is no surprise that HBO decided to back “a slow-burn procedural unfolding against the backdrop of a shocking murder in a small town — with a supernatural twist” plot to reel in viewers. 
The Outsider is an adaptation of a 2018 Stephen King novel that combines elements of two genres that enjoy red-hot popularity on TV: supernatural fantasy and true crime. There could not be material more ideal for a miniseries, because while the show offers the comfort (discomfort?) of dark investigative dramas, it also throws in bone-chilling scares and several jump-out-of-your-chair moments associated with adaptations of King’s works.
What highly works in The Outsider’s favour is an unusual yet riveting pilot episode, which sets up the shows’ world beautifully. Detective Ralph Anderson (Ben Mendelsohn) is on his way to a baseball game with his fellow officers to arrest high school coach Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) for the gruesome murder of a young boy. There are multiple witnesses who have offered up damning testimonies, and a mountain of forensic discovery to suggest Maitland is the killer. 
A case that seems like a slam dunk, however, takes a turn when overwhelming evidence about Maitland being present in a different town at the time of the murder turns up. Both scenarios — that of Maitland having murdered the kid, and him being nowhere near the child at the time of the death — seem equally likely. Has Maitland concocted the perfect crime? Is there a doppelgänger on the loose? At one point, I even began wondering if there is an alternate timeline being hinted at.
A lot of this — the crime, the arrest, the conflicting evidence, Maitland’s incarceration, etc — emerges in the first episode itself; an hour packed with enough plot developments to make you wonder what the rest of the show will cover. This is where screenwriter Richard Price (The Night Of, The Wire) excels: the pacing of each episode — and not just the pilot — is exquisite, even as the point of intrigue often seamlessly shifts from one plot-point to another.
And there is a wonderful ensemble to boot. Ever since Mendelsohn broke onto the scene with his marvellous performance on Bloodline, he has been picking up substantial roles in Hollywood movies. But here, he gets to truly dig in and display his wide range as a performer. Bateman plays Maitland with eerie efficiency. Bill Camp, Jeremy Bobb and Mare Winningham are all terrific, and watching all these great actors in the same frame is a real treat. There is also Cynthia Erivo, who only appears in the third episode as a private investigator with a taste for the supernatural — a complete foil to Anderson’s character, who only goes by hard evidence. Their beliefs often clash, making them the perfect duo to play off each other.
The Outsider’s USP, apart from that stellar cast, is that it is a whodunit and a howdunit and a whydunit and even a whatdunit all rolled into one, and it does so without ever turning messy. I did feel that the veil was lifted off its big mystery a bit earlier than desirable, resulting in the show peaking mid-season, but the final act is not disappointing by any stretch of imagination. As far as book adaptations go, it embodies all the qualities of a great novel: it is extensively-plotted, emotionally-layered, and keeps you hooked till the very end.
The Outsider is now streaming on Hotstar.

Cinema journalism in the time of COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cinema-journalism-in-the-time-of-covid-19/article31110058.ece,"As I start this column, the one and only press screening in the near future — Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles much-celebrated Cannes jury prize winner Bacurau — stands cancelled. I bring out my notepad to strike things off from my to-do list. 
No meetings lined up at Soho House, no events at any of the suburban five-star hotels, no interviews in Oshiwara and Lokhandwala. Life in the time of COVID-19 can seem mournfully desolate for a film journalist. Yet, at the same time, it has become decidedly challenging and stimulating. When the world, as we know it, is changing drastically and irredeemably, cinema can’t stay complacent and comfortable in its aesthetic and escapist isolation. So too when it comes to writing about it.
It comes with the awareness that the sense of void I might be feeling is of little consequence given the critical state of affairs across the world. But I cannot brush aside the fact that it’s barely a few days and I am already missing my filmi routine. I miss the American Beauty-inspired interiors of PVR Le Rêve in Bandra and the cheese sandwich and small samosas at Juhu’s Sunny Super Sound preview theatre. I thought this year I would participate in making history by attending the first-ever film festival in Saudi Arabia. Far from it. The fate of one of the grandest celebrations of cinema, Festival de Cannes, also hangs in the balance. 
But more than any of these banalities, it’s your very place in the larger journalistic scheme of things that calls for introspection in such times. Cinema and cricket, two of the most popular news topics, suddenly seem weirdly out of place. In my immediate memory as a journalist, I have felt the churn most during 9/11 and 26/11; it happens briefly during elections (the filmi candidates and campaigners notwithstanding); and it has been happening consistently over the past three months, ever since the Delhi police barged into the Jamia library. 
Beat of the times
It was a defining moment, a tipping point. Disturbed, enraged, not knowing what to do about the unrest within, I had gone the next day to a small, spontaneously held protest at Mumbai University’s Kalina campus only to find a bunch of known faces from Bollywood mingling with the ‘hoi polloi’, perhaps trying to reclaim their supposedly airy world of images and anchoring it in the real. Just as I was subconsciously trying to attune the journalist in me (that is always a step ahead of the cinema writer) to the beat of the times. Protests became sites to forge a larger intuitive connect with the film fraternity in asserting the fact that cinema can’t be peripheral to national discourse.
Much like the stars we mingle with, film journalists are assumed to live in ivory towers. It’s time to step out of the bubble and engage with the real world. More so at a moment of reckoning of the kind we are facing now. Yes, many more people are presumably lapping up mounds of content from the cable and the web within the confines of their homes. I have two Berlinale films and several indies in my inbox, Road to Roma to watch on Netflix, and Virus to revisit on Prime Video.
Cinema has been wrenched out of its cocoon. There are huge losses and uncertainties across the spectrum — from big producers to daily-wage earners, from theatre owners to audiences. The creation, distribution and consumption of cinema is set to change unalterably, and this demands our attention. And give it, we must. Until it’s safe once again to return to feel-good, escapist entertainment.

Since most of us are increasingly working from home and practising social distancing in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19, Sudheer felt the time is right to share fitness videos. “When we are home and not moving around enough, we burn fewer calories. It’s important to take up some activity or the other. Gyms are shut, so I thought I’ll share videos of how to do a few bodyweight exercises and use easy-to-find props at home,” says the actor.

The first video uploaded on Thursday is a ‘chest and biceps’ routine that requires a warm up and a set of exercises — flat chest press, incline chest press, decline chest press, chest press using a ball, reverse palm push-ups, bicep curls and bicep concentration curls. His step-by-step demonstrations teaches the right form to avoid injuries. In addition, he suggests a cardio regimen too.
 




 
The second video Sudheer shared on Friday morning targeted ‘back and triceps’ with back extension, rows, superman, pull ups, tricep dips, extensions and diamond push-ups.
 




 
If push-ups are easy for you, Sudheer shows how you can step up the intensity using a backpack for increased resistance.
The next three days, Sudheer will be uploading exercise regimens for shoulder and abs, legs and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).
Fitness is a way of life for Sudheer. He talks about having been diligent with his regimens for years, with a 45 to 60-minute duration. For his next film, the action thriller V directed by Indraganti Mohanakrishna and co-starring Nani, Aditi Rao Hydari and Nivetha Thomas, he tweaked his fitness routine to be “more agile and stronger.”
V, initially scheduled to release during Ugadi, has been postponed owing to the COVID-19 outbreak.

According to Variety, the organising team confirmed that the festival would no longer be scheduled on the original dates of May 12 to 23, and that other options were being considered, such as towards the end of June. 
A statement was also released by the festival, that comes after weeks of wondering if it were to happen, particularly after the cancellation of other film festivals like Tribeca, South by Southwest, and so on, in the recent few weeks. 
“At this time of global health crisis, our thoughts go to the victims of the COVID-19 and we express our solidarity with all of those who are fighting the disease,” read the statement, adding, “As soon as the development of the French and international health situation will allow us to assess the real possibility, we will make our decision known, in accordance with our ongoing consultation with the French Government and Cannes’ City Hall as well as with the Festival’s Board Members, Film industry professionals and all the partners of the event.”
The organisers also stated, “In the meantime, the Festival de Cannes lends its vocal support to all of those who firmly call on everyone to respect the general lockdown, and ask to show solidarity in these difficult times for the entire world.”
This is the first time the Cannes festival has been postponed since its inception in 1946. It was cancelled once earlier in 1968 during the nationwide students riots in France.",movies

Daniel said, “For all those out there, especially teenagers and millennials who think this is not serious, please know that it is.”
He went on, adding, “If you treat this without care, you are potentially endangering the lives of millions of people, including your loved ones. So for the sake of everyone else, please follow the guidelines: social distancing, self-isolate, stop touching your face, and wash your hands.”
Daniel also apologised to the cast and crew members he had worked with recently, who he may have exposed to the virus and also expressed his gratitude to the healthcare workers helping patients. “I believe that healthcare for all is a right, not a privilege. Everyone who meets the qualifications to be tested should be, because the virus doesn’t care about race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, whether you’re rich or poor,” he added.
Finally, Daniel also addressed the racial discrimination and violence that Asian people have been facing since the outbreak of the coronavirus across the world, including a reference to USA President Donald Trump terming COVD-19 as the “Chinese virus”.
“Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people. Beating elderly, even homeless Asian Americans is heartbreaking and inexcusable. I’m Asian, and yes I have coronavirus, but I did not get it from China. I got it in America, in New York City.”
“Despite what some political leaders want to call it, I don’t consider the place where it’s from as important as the people who are sick. If I had, I would call this thing the New York virus... but that would be silly. This name-calling gets us nowhere. What matters is how best we take care of ourselves and each other.,” he concluded.
Daniel Dae Kim was shooting on the NBC series New Amsterdam, when he was diagnosed. He joins other celebrities like Idris Elba and Game of Thrones actors Indira Varma and Kristofer Hivju who also announced that they were infected with COVD-19.",movies

"Postpone Olympics, says Sharath Kamal ",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postpone-olympics-says-sharath-kamal/article31130854.ece,"India’s veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal is in line to play his fourth Olympics in July-August but he wants the IOC to postpone the mega event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As an athlete, I obviously want the Olympics to happen but it should not happen. 
“The epicentre of the virus will keep changing, first it was China, now it is Italy and Iran too is badly affected in Asia. I don’t see the scenario being safe for the Olympics to start on time,” the 37-year-old told PTI.
“Everyone is talking about social distancing but it is one thing which won’t be possible at the Olympics. Thousands of athletes would be staying in the same village,” he said.",other sports
How long until news if Olympics will open? ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/how-long-until-news-if-olympics-will-open/article31130748.ece,"The Olympic flame has arrived in Japan from Greece. Next comes the torch relay around the country, which is scheduled to start on Thursday from Fukushima prefecture in northern Japan.
Organisers have asked crowds to be restrained, but have been imprecise about what that means. Greek officials last week stopped a relay there on the second day and did not resume because of crowd size.
In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, Japanese organisers and IOC president Thomas Bach say that the Games will open on July 24 at the $1.43 billion National Stadium in central Tokyo.
Bach has repeatedly said it’s too early to announce a final decision, saying he’s taking advice from a task force that includes the World Health Organisation. 
But now there’s push back, mostly from athletes and former Olympians who are complaining: they can’t train, qualifying events have been cancelled, and the chaos is sure to favour some over others. Then there’s the question of bringing 11,000 athletes and staff together in the Olympic Village, and 4,400 Paralympians a month later.
Getting the flame to Japan represents a minor victory for both organisers and the IOC. Its symbolic presence could give the IOC space to postpone the Tokyo Olympics, leaving the symbol behind as a reminder of what’s still to come.
What is the deadline for making a final decision? 
Bach surely knows, but he is not saying. In an interview with the New York Times Bach said cancellation is not on the agenda. That leaves only going ahead, or postponement, as the options. Empty venues seem to have been ruled out.
Who will make the final decision? 
It will be made jointly with the IOC, the city of Tokyo, and the Japanese Olympic Committee. They are the three that signed the 81-page Host City Agreement, which spells out in enormous details all Games contingencies. 
The IOC has all the leverage, though it will have to honour WHO suggestions and the interests of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The IOC has a reserve fund of about $2 billion and insurance to cover losses. The contract says termination can occur “... if the IOC has reasonable grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, that the safety of participants in the Games is seriously threatened or jeopardised for any reason, whatsoever.” 
Tokyo is officially spending $12.6 billion to organise the Olympics, but a national audit says it’s at least twice that much.
How important is the torch relay to the IOC and local organisers? 
It’s important symbolism for the Japanese government and Prime Minister Abe.
 He is Japan’s longest-serving premier and hopes to use the Olympics to argue that the Fukushima area has recovered from the disaster nine years ago. 
The government has dubbed these The Recovery Olympics. However, many residents are still living in temporary quarters after the earthquake, tsunami and meltdown of three nuclear reactors in 2011.
Getting the relay started from Fukushima also helps major IOC sponsors Coca-Cola and Toyota, who pay millions to give their brands exposure during the relay. Crowds are being asked to be restrained. This will not keep the images of the relay from being transmitted daily around the globe on television. Bach is expected to watch the relay when it reaches Hiroshima on May 18-19.
Any bookmaker taking odds?
An Irish bookmaker says 1-7 Games will not open as schedule on July 24. 
A poll by Japanese news agency Kyodo this week showed 69.9% of Japanese questioned do not believe the Games will begin on time.",other sports
OTT platforms are seeing a slew of East Asian historical dramas,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ott-platforms-are-seeing-a-slew-of-east-asian-historical-dramas/article31110218.ece,"With a future that is not foreseeable, the past appears like a welcome revisitation. Even as the coronavirus has a whiplash effect on the hardening of borders across Asia, the OTT space is proliferating with entertainment of an imaginary Asia — with Korea, China and India in the lead — streaming a slew of narratives of nationhood, past heroisms, and fabled spectacle. India’s shows are broadly limited to Ramayana, Jhansi Ki Rani and Baahubali, but the Korean and Chinese shows are a heady mix of fictionalised historicals, often garnished with magic, sci-fi and impossible feats. 
The founding of national history is a big inspiration: the massively staged Mandarin serial Qin Empire Alliance is a virtual history of the conflicts between the Wei, Qi, Chu, Song, Xue, Lu and other warring states and the hard-fought domination of the Qin, the first dynasty of imperial China. The Qin, despite its short rule, set up a system of imperial administration that lasted from 221 BC till 1912 AD. 
Almost in tandem, there is the series The King’s War, which describes the peasant uprising that overthrew Qin rule and led to the founding of the Han dynasty, under the mercurial peasant leader Liu Bang. An extraordinary character in Chinese history, described by Mao Zedong as the most powerful of the feudal emperors, Liu Bang is even today regarded as a folk hero. He rose from a village police official chasing chicken thieves to become the leader of a guerilla army. Shrewd and gritty, he led them to victory and established himself as Emperor Gaozu, going on to set up the Han dynasty for 400 years.
Brave queens
In close tandem are narratives of the charismatic Chinese empresses such as Empress Ki, sold in slavery from Korea to China under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, where she rises to become empress in a court beset by intrigue. Played by the extraordinary Korean actress Ha Ji-won, Empress Ki is a highly emotive tale of how she singlehandedly seeks to avenge the tiny kingdom of Goryeo against the mighty Mongols. 
The narrative of female slavery resonates even in the 20th century with the memory of Korea’s comfort women under Japanese occupation. In similar vein is another historical figure, Wei Young, who in the 6th century is assigned as a maid to the royal palace of the Northern Wei kingdom. She survives intrigue and machinations to marry the emperor Tuoba Jun, and then finally rules as regent during the reigns of her son and grandson.
The courtly systems in play, in Korea and China, the dominant influence of Confucianism, the intrigue and manipulations of favourites within the harem and the role of eunuchs as confidants and advisers, together allow for multiple subplots and the visualisation of cultural norms. Common to both histories is the figure of the historian, such as Sima Qian, the father of Chinese historiography, who appears in several serials.
The Korean narratives portray life in the early Silla kingdom, and the medieval kingdoms that followed, Goryeo and Joseon; the latter survived until the Japanese occupation, which lasted from 1910 till 1945. Archivists and history enthusiasts have pointed out that the much vaunted tradition of the kisaeng or Korean courtesan may have had a chequered history. As celebrated entertainers — such as the 16th-century poet Hwang Jin-i — the kisaeng had proximity to officials and nobility. Seen as purveyors of art, the kisaeng house in Korean serials is also the centre of intrigue, romance and intense drama. 
K-pop history
What is of enormous interest — and contemporary relevance — is the line drawn between ancient and present day cultural fads. K-pop male fashions, of men wearing make-up even with a masculine appearance, find an echo in hwarang, the elite “poet warrior youth” of the Silla period. Depicted in 7th-century Korean paintings, they appear in the eponymous series Hwarang as a cross between protectors of the faith and a boy band. 
But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Korean serials lies in their secondary characters — the scholars and intellectuals, who negotiated with the Ming and Qing dynasties, sought to resist Japanese naval invasions, and in their powerful factions of the Soron and Noron during the Joseon period, fought each other for imperial favour. The Korean nobility, inspired by Confucianism and administrative protocol, are frequently caught in periods of intense transition. The finest work that demonstrates this tension is the somewhat cheesily titled Mr. Sunshine, a beautifully crafted story of a poor Korean émigré to the US, who returns as an official and uncovers a plot to attack Korea.
In these days of lockdown, perhaps this is one way of crossing borders.

"I look for trouble: Naveen Richard on his new stand-up special, ‘Relatively Relatable’",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/i-look-for-trouble-naveen-richard-on-his-new-stand-up-special-relatively-relatable/article31126557.ece,"Try as he might, Naveen Richard cannot escape Hindi. As a South Indian born in Tamil Nadu and bred in Bengaluru, the comedian was forced to learn the language in school and even fared well when it came to scoring in the subject. Conversations, unfortunately, are a different matter altogether. “Hindi as a compulsory second language is not going to work. The words just don’t flow,” says the 29-year-old, who first shed light on his linguistic impediments in the web series Star Boyz (2016). In it, three South Indians in outer space miserably, albeit hilariously, fail to communicate in Jat (pronounced ‘Jaaat’ by the Boyz) with an alien of the Raj Kachori species.
Now the former lawyer revisits his shortcomings in a new comedy special, Relatively Relatable,that premièred on March 20. “I feel like I belong in Bengaluru and it has got the right mix of everybody,” says Richard about the location of his special. “I did not want to go too Bengaluru with my jokes or viewers would feel disconnected, but something like me not being able to speak in Hindi would land especially large there.”
The special comes after a year-and-a-half of meticulous writing and countless trial shows. With comedy specials aplenty floating about on streaming platforms, making his stand out was essential. “I cannot sit through a whole special and you have to be a huge comedy fan to sit through one,” laughs the comedian, adding that he has tried really hard to incorporate changes in the tone of comedy. Like a humorous journey, the set traverses observational jokes, silly stories and a surprise in the middle of the show. “It has not been done before and I hope it is taken well,” pauses Richard, then admitting after a beat, “It is weird and strange, something that will take away from the monotony of a long special.”
Guaranteed to be family-friendly, Relatively Relatable is chock-full of anecdotes — some bizarre and others downright outlandish. But Richard vehemently insists that they are all true incidents. Like when he was being harassed by a non-profit whose sales strategies for a sick baby were obviously too far out. Digging for the truth made him do some serious sleuthing, even resulting in a visit to their office with a face-to-face inquisition. “I had to do the joke in clear conscience; if it did not exist, I could write a great ending,” he says.
But as luck would have it, Richard has always attracted misadventures, and the NGO was a legitimate institution. “I felt terrible but now I am really involved in helping them get donations,” he chuckles, adding that they even invited him to be the chief guest for the inauguration of five new public toilets. A situation eerily similar to the plot of his show, Better Life Foundation. “I look for trouble and most people would run away from the things that I walk into. But I have survived so far,” he says. “[In the show] I say some pretty outlandish things like learning kung fu as a child, but I am not lying. There is very little that is made up.”
In the last few years, the comic has transcended the stand-up stage and paved the way for scripted comedy when it comes to original Indian content. He has played a benign NGO founder on Better Life Foundation; a South Indian space adventurer; an angry profane librarian; and a host of crazy characters in his sketches — case in point an annoying child in the special Go Straight Take Left.
But in real life, Richard is the antithesis of what we have seen. “I relate to Rowan Atkinson who is quite dull in real life.” Though he admits that channelling whimsy and the silly comes naturally during the creative process. “I do not have to try too hard,” he says. That is Richard’s signature brand of humour: light-hearted, warm and fuzzy, just like he promises Relatively Relatablewill be. “I wanted to talk about things that would carry people away in a hot air balloon for a little while and make them forget everything,” he concludes.
Relatively Relatable is now on Amazon Prime Video.",entertainment
"Kenny Rogers, country music icon and actor, dead at 81",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/kenny-rogers-country-music-icon-and-actor-dead-at-81/article31126396.ece,"Actor-singer Kenny Rogers, the smooth, Grammy-winning balladeer who spanned jazz, folk, country and pop with such hits as “Lucille,” “Lady” and “Islands in the Stream” and embraced his persona as “The Gambler” on record and on TV died Friday night. He was 81.
The Houston-born performer with the husky voice and silver beard sold tens of millions of records, won three Grammys and was the star of TV movies based on “The Gambler” and other songs, making him a superstar in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Rogers thrived for some 60 years before retired from touring in 2017 at age 79. Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer. 
“You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don’t invite comparison,” Rogers told in 2015. “And I chose that way because I could never be better than Johnny Cash or Willie or Waylon at what they did. So I found something that I could do that didn’t invite comparison to them. And I think people thought it was my desire to change country music. But that was never my issue.” 
A true rags-to-riches story, Rogers was raised in public housing in Houston Heights with seven siblings. As a 20-year-old, he had a gold single called “That Crazy Feeling,” under the name Kenneth Rogers, but when that early success stalled, he joined a jazz group, the Bobby Doyle Trio, as a standup bass player. 
But his breakthrough came when he was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels, a folk group, in 1966. The band reformed as First Edition and scored a pop hit with the psychedelic song, “Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).” Rogers and First Edition mixed country-rock and folk on songs like “Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love To Town,” a story of a Vietnam veteran begging his girlfriend to stay. 
After the group broke up in 1974, Rogers started his solo career and found a big hit with the sad country ballad “Lucille,” in 1977, which crossed over to the pop charts and earned Rogers his first Grammy. Suddenly the star, Rogers added hit after hit for more than a decade. 
“The Gambler,” the Grammy-winning story song penned by Don Schlitz, came out in 1978 and became his signature song with a signature refrain- “You gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em.” The song spawned a hit TV movie of the same name and several more sequels featuring Rogers as professional gambler Brady Hawkes, and led to a lengthy side career for Rogers as a TV actor and host of several TV specials. 
Other hits included “You Decorated My Life,” “Every Time Two Fools Collide” with Dottie West, “Don’t Fall In Love with a Dreamer” with Kim Carnes, and “Coward of the County.” One of his biggest successes was “Lady,” written by Lionel Richie, a chart topper for six weeks straight in 1980. Richie said in a 2017 interview with the AP that he often didn’t finish songs until he had already pitched them, which was the case for “Lady.” 
“In the beginning, the song was called, ‘Baby,’” Richie said. “And because when I first sat with him, for the first 30 minutes, all he talked about was he just got married to a real lady. A country guy like him is married to a lady. So, he said, ‘By the way, what’s the name of the song?’” Richie replies, “Lady.” 
Over the years, Rogers worked often with female duet partners, most memorably, Dolly Parton. The two were paired at the suggestion of the Bee Gees’ Barry Gibb, who wrote “Islands in the Stream.” 
“Barry was producing an album on me and he gave me this song,” Rogers told the AP in 2017. “And I went and learned it and went into the studio and sang it for four days. And I finally looked at him and said, ‘Barry, I don’t even like this song anymore.’ And he said, ‘You know what we need? We need Dolly Parton.’ I thought, ‘Man, that guy is a visionary.’” 
Coincidentally, Parton was actually in the same recording studio in Los Angeles when the idea came up. 
“From the moment she marched into that room, that song never sounded the same,” Rogers said. “It took on a whole new spirit.” 
The two singers toured together, including in Australia and New Zealand in 1984 and 1987, and were featured in a HBO concert special. Over the years the two would continue to record together, including their last duet, “You Can’t Make Old Friends,” which was released in 2013. Parton reprised “Islands in the Stream” with Rogers during his all-star retirement concert held in Nashville in October 2017. 
Rogers invested his time and money in a lot of other endeavors over his career, including a passion for photography that led to several books, as well as an autobiography, “Making It With Music.” He had a chain of restaurants called “Kenny Rogers Roasters,” and was a partner behind a riverboat in Branson, Missouri. He was also involved in numerous charitable causes, among them the Red Cross and MusicCares, and was part of the all-star “We are the World” recording for famine relief. 
By the ‘90s, his ability to chart hits had waned, although he still remained a popular live entertainer with regular touring. Still he was an inventive businessman and never stopped trying to find his way back onto the charts. 
At the age of 61, Rogers had a brief comeback on the country charts in 2000 with a hit song “Buy Me A Rose,” thanks to his other favorite medium, television. Producers of the series “Touched By An Angel” wanted him to appear in an episode, and one of his managers suggested the episode be based on his latest single. That cross-promotional event earned him his first No. 1 country song in 13 years. 
Rogers’ family is planning a private service “out of concern for the national COVID-19 emergency,” a statement posted early Saturday read. A public memorial will be held at a later date. ",entertainment
How restaurants in Coimbatore are coping with the Coronavirus outbreak,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-restaurants-in-coimbatore-are-coping-with-the-coronavirus-outbreak/article31127735.ece,"For Chippikul Muthu, who sells dosas at his roadside stall, it was business as usual till the authorities asked him to shut down. He hopes he can reopen as soon as he gets permission, as there are enough people who, he says, will return to eat his food. Till he shut down, “we did brisk business.” Muthu is praying fervently that things will get better. “I cannot afford to close it down for long. I have loans to repay.”

Coimbatore’s favourite haunt is facing the Coronavirus brunt too. “Our business has come down drastically over the weeks,” says Executive Director, Jegan Srinivasan of Annapoorna. RHR’s group’s M Sivakumar agrees that walk-ins have seen a drastic drop of 30-40%. “We have cut down on production for two weeks. Our employees are at work but they are idle most of the time.” Sivakumar is optimistic “We haven’t thought about any other activity to engage them, as this is a temporary issue. Soon, hopefully, things will improve.” 
But both point out that hygiene has always been priority and they are taking extra precautions now to ensure the staff and the equipment in the kitchens are in good health and condition. Sivakumar adds that the employees have health insurance.

These are trying times. Uncertain ones for restaurant owners and their staff. As customers peter out, there is the very real worry of what to do with the employees. Some have done the best they can and are hoping their regular clients will now order through food aggregators. “We are urging out customers to order online. We are doing everything we can to reassure them that the food is being prepared in the most safe and hygienic way,” says Shreeya Adka of the fine-dine restaurant The French Door.

Speaking of her three restaurants (On The Go, That’s Y Food and Café Totaram), Ranjana Singhal says, “Even online business is not doing that well. But, of the three, Totaram is doing a little better.” 
Arun Viswanathan of Infusions Café prefers to be more upbeat as he says, “While there is a 15% decrease in the number of people walking in, sales through apps have increased by 30%.”

Neel Chhabria, who runs Kailash Parbat (Brookefields Mall) and The Noodle Theory (RS Puram), repeatedly uses the phrase, ‘need of the hour’. “If it had been anything else, we would have felt bad about shutting down. But given the magnitude of what’s happening, no complaints,” he says. Both restaurants are not allowing any dine-in. “The need of the hour is prevention, so we decided to close down.” 
Shreeya, Ranjana, Neel and Arun are using the extra time as productively as they possibly can. Neel laughs. “I am telling them to go play in the open area. There is no one round and they’ll never get a chance like this,” he says before adding more seriously, “We can’t send them away. What will they do? So we’re bleeding doubly but I believe our loss is fractional compared to what’s happening around the world.” 
Ranjana is ensuring that her team’s morale does not go down. “We are using the time to upskill the staff. We are working on a new lunch combo menu, the logistics for that, picking out new crockery and constantly talking to the staff about customer relations, soft skills... all this is keeping us occupied. I can’t clutch my head in despair and give up. I prefer to stay active, mentally at least. I am hopeful that, sometime in April, I will be well prepared with the new menu and we can have a trial run.” Of course, all dependent on the situation, as “once I launch the menu, I cannot roll back.” 
The staff of Infusions Café is also following suit with having trials for new goodies to be introduced in the future. Says Arun, “We will use the time productively and concentrate on delivery service. While I have no immediate plans of shutting the café, I will do so if things do not improve.”

This ensures less possibility of contagion and keeps the restaurants going By not demanding hand sanitisers. Restaurants provide handwashes and you might want to leave your table, go to wash your hands. Or bring your own hand sanitisers
Shreeya is a combination of resignation and positivity. “Things are not good at all with a drop of nearly 50 per cent in our guests. It is tough. But someone told me that the pollution is coming down and what is happening is Nature’s way of giving herself time to rest and recuperate. This break has given us more time to focus on a new menu. All of us are involved in it, so that is good. We had set aside many small projects, and we can work on them now. So that when all this down, the tedious back-end work will be over and we can concentrate on our guests.” ",society

Panic buying: Much ado about toilet paper,https://www.thehindu.com/society/panic-buying-much-ado-about-toilet-paper/article31110182.ece,"So, you’re living in a so-called developed country and an epidemic starts spreading like wildfire. The world is falling apart. You realise your best chance is to stay at home, minimise contact with other people, and try and survive the best you can. 
But before you batten down the hatches, you must make a run to the nearest supermarket to capture whatever essential supplies you can for yourself and your family. Now, watching from this corner of the planet, one would imagine you would try and pick up long-lasting food supplies such as rice, flour, pasta, cous-cous, canned food, meat and veg that you can freeze and defrost later, a fair bit of alcohol perhaps, and soap, hand sanitisers and disinfectants. As everybody else also rushes into panic buying, one can imagine fights breaking out as people reach for the last packets of sugar or UHT long-life milk cartons. 
But none of this happens — the brawls break out over packets of toilet rolls; you actually try to claw out some fellow shopper’s eyes as you wrestle with them over a 36-pack of ‘double-ply, extra soft’; somebody puts somebody else in hospital over a carton of ‘unscented, re-cycled’; shoppers are seen stumbling out into the parking lots with teetering towers of toilet paper and stuffing them into their cars as though they’re pulling off a heist of gold ingots from Fort Knox — if only I can get these 96 rolls home safely, everything I’ve always dreamt of will be mine! 
Absurd product
 Sitting where we are, one could be forgiven for thinking — what’s wrong with these people, has someone told them the water supply is going to be turned off? 
The next bit of thinking could take the following route: What a wasteful culture the West has created! If only someone had taught them during toilet training how to wash themselves properly with water, and how that was much cleaner and healthier, there would not be this billion-dollar industry cutting down country-sized swathes of trees every year to manufacture this absurd product. Just a simple lota or mug in each toilet would take away this unseemly panic about the most simple act of daily hygiene. 
After the brawls and semi-riots come the jokes on social media. A middle-eastern man posts a picture on Twitter of a lota with a spout and the comment: ‘Perhaps use this while others are killing each other over toilet-paper?’ To which an irate Englishwoman replies: ‘This is NOT the time for a cup of tea!’ Then there is a video from Australia where a man wearing a suit and a traditional bush hat sits in a bar and recites a poem that imagines looking at this moment from the future and examining why exactly toilet paper became such an issue. Talking about a moment when ‘the nation s***t itself’, the poem describes the hoarding of toilet paper : ‘…while other rocked on the verandah, their shotgun fully manned/ to protect their precious stock — they’d rather die than use their hand!’ 
After a while, the humour subsides and the seriousness kicks in. A few years ago, I was witness to a public transport strike in London that stretched over two or three days during which most of the underground rail network was shut down and very few buses were running. 
On the first day, people stayed in queues, more or less observing the daily civic courtesies for which Britain is known. On the second day, with buses on each route becoming more and more rare, tempers began to flare, and I began to notice increased pushing and shoving. By the evening rush hour on the third day, central London’s bus stops began to resemble Bombay’s Churchgate of yore, or Delhi’s Connaught Place or Calcutta’s Dharmatala, with people surrounding bus doors in feral swirls, shouting, clawing and body-slamming their way into each infrequent bus. It was startling to observe the thin cladding of the first world fall apart so quickly in the face of a little scarcity. 
Herd logic
 By now, there are articles on the Net about the run on toilet paper and how panic sets off ‘herd’ behaviour in people even in developed societies. When people feel things spiralling out of control, they strive to grab some agency in their daily lives and often this comes through the act of over-purchasing necessities; when people see others stock-piling some item, everyone starts reaching to corner ‘enough’ of the same product, leaving aside logic. 
In India, we’ve often seen this kind of behaviour during crises and the repercussions of anticipated scarcity. Historically, we saw it before the famine of 1943; and recently we witnessed it during the demonetisation disaster. 
We may see it yet again in the near future as the actual virus and the panic virus beset us in tandem.

Variations,https://www.thehindu.com/society/variations/article31110558.ece,"No one made a bad bid, but the obstructive East-West bidding jockeyed North-South into a game contract that was far from cold. The opening club lead was covered by the queen and king and ducked by South. East shifted to the king of hearts, won by dummy’s ace. Declarer led a spade to his queen and West’s king. West led his remaining heart — low, eight, ruff. South led a diamond to dummy’s ace and led a spade. There was nothing East could do to defeat the contract at this point. He won and led a club to South’s ace. Declarer drew the last trump and then took the marked diamond finesse for his contract. 
East could have defeated the contract by shifting to his singleton diamond at trick two. Leading into dummy’s ace-king-jack might seem like a dangerous play, but we don’t think so. On the auction, South didn’t need much help in playing the diamond suit. Also, didn’t West rate to have a spade entry? Did West really open the bidding with just one queen and one jack? 
South could have made it more difficult by winning the opening lead and leading the queen of spades from his hand. A diamond shift would still defeat the contract, with best defence, but that shift would be much harder to find from the West hand.",society
Fighting fear ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/fighting-fear/article31126125.ece,"Even in times of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine, a lot of us are keeping our spirits up by singing, dancing, cooking, and making up hilarious Corona memes. However, there is a small, yet significant section of people that is not laughing. The spread of the pandemic has meant something very different to them.
“These are troubling times for people who live with contamination obsessions,” says Dr C J John, chief psychiatrist of Medical Trust Hospital. Since the Corona outbreak, he has seen a couple of people who were in a state of panic. The viral outbreak could trigger irrational fears in those who have mild to severe contamination obsessions and washing compulsions. “It may exacerbate the condition in a few patients,” says Dr John.
Those who are predisposed to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or have illness anxiety are at a higher risk of being affected by the fear caused by the spread of the virus. OCD is defined as a mental disorder in which a person has recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make him or her feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviour, such as hand washing, checking on things, or cleaning, can significantly interfere with the person’s daily activities and social interactions, according to the DSM 5 (Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) of the American Psychiatric Association.
While awareness and information are vital, there is a literal “infodemic” (an information pandemic) that is adversely affecting people with anxiety disorders, says Dr John. “A lot of the information passed around on social media may be authentic, however, this information overload could prove distressing to patients who keep tracking news compulsively, worsening their condition.”
Mental health experts suggest that those with pre-existing emotional disorders such as health anxiety and depression, those being treated for OCD or anxiety, and those who are experiencing distress, seek medical help. If you have a family member who has OCD, help them by regulating the flow of information at home, and by avoiding real-time tracking of the news.
However, the situation, says Dr John, is also an opportunity to trace signs of obsessive disorders in a loved one. “Even to remove contamination by a deadly virus such as Corona, you need to wash your hands only for 20 seconds.” If you or someone close to you is doing this more than necessary, do check in with a psychologist.",society
Centre releases local body grants to States ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-releases-local-body-grants-to-states/article31131366.ece,"The Centre has released ₹2,570 crore in the 14th Finance Commission grants that had been withheld from the States for not conducting elections to the local bodies, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.

Chicken and maize prices crash as COVID-19 takes a toll ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/chicken-and-maize-prices-crash-as-covid-19-takes-a-toll/article31131361.ece,"Chicken prices have crashed from ₹90 a kg last month to ₹20 in Mumbai as people are staying away from consuming poultry in fearing COVID-19.
Despite several awareness campaigns to demolish misconceptions that poultry had something to do with the dreaded virus, people are still staying away.
Listed poultry companies such as Pune-based Venky’s (India) Ltd. and Indore-based Simran Firms Ltd. (SFL) are likely to report lower revenues in this quarter as business has suffered enormously.
Despite several attempts a senior official from Venky’s was not available for comment.
“The poultry prices are all time low. Ex-farm broiler price is ₹10-₹15 per kg (cost of production ₹75 per kg ) and egg prices are ₹1.5 per egg ex farm ( cost of production is ₹3.5 per egg). Due to reduction in chicken and egg production , feed demand and prices are coming down on daily basis. The price of main raw material , like corn and soya bean meal , have dropped more than 10% in last 2 weeks,” said a Godrej Agrovet Ltd. spokesperson. 
As per a previous estimate, the poultry trade in Maharashtra was losing over ₹10 crore a day due to lack of appetite for chicken.
“Though there is no direct link between chicken and COVID-19, people will stay away from poultry as long as the fear is there. So it will impact the poultry companies like Venky’s and SFL and any other company that is linked to this business. In this quarter, their revenues will be lower and the trend has been reflected in their share prices on account of this direct impact,” said Ambareesh Baliga, independent equity analyst.
Poultry farmers are bearing the maximum brunt due to the price crash and there has been no compensation from the government.
“The business has totally collapsed. Prices have crashed to ₹20 a kg and there has been no demand. Earlier, I used to sell 150 birds a day, now it has come down to a dozen,” said Salim Momin, a poultry dealer from Lalbaug, Mumbai.
Similarly, prices of maize which goes into making poultry feed has reduced to a great extent. 
Grain merchant Devendra Vora, proprietor, Friendship Brokers, APMC Market, New Mumbai, said maize prices had slumped since last two to three months when COVID-19 started spreading around the world. 
“Maize prices have slumped because there is no global demand. Since demand for poultry feed has come down, maize prices have suffered. Due to COVID-19 effect, prices have reduced to ₹1,500 to ₹1,600 per 100 kg from ₹1,900 in January.”
“Farmers are the worst suffers,” he added.
In Maharashtra, the minimum support price for maize has come down to less than ₹1,300 per 100 kg from ₹1,700 last year. 
This indicates the lower income for farmers.
“Demand for maize, a crucial component for the poultry industry is hit and there has been an dip in prices as well. This is owing to the food processing industry facing issues such as shortage of staff owing to COVID-19. However, we believe that if we as a society are able to control the spread of Corona virus in the next couple of weeks, we would witness the prices will springing back to normal. The graph of food grains prices will rebound quickly as demand from food processing industry will rise in order to upsurge capacity utilizations from the low levels of operations presently,” said Amith Aggarwal, CEO, Agribazaar.
“We believe that this is the right time for government agencies to collaborate with private companies like us and plan for greater MSP procurement to protect the interest of our farmers. Any current stress to farmers may spill over and adversely impact sowing in the Kharif season,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

CUB will end the current fiscal with a total of 700 branches. It had invested about ₹10 crore in opening 50 branches this fiscal.

About 25% of new branches would be in un-banked rural areas.
“At the given run-rate, we might be opening 200 branches over the next three to four years. The investment per branch works out to ₹15-20 lakh in fixed cost. Each branch would hire about six people, including one manager and one officer,” he said. 
According to him, the bank had enough staff. Every year, the probable candidates are selected through campus recruitment during June-August and provided training. That is why new branches are opened during the fourth quarter, he said.
Asserting that all the that 600 branches were profit-making, he added that it took at least two years for a branch to attain break even. 
“On an annual basis, each branch would fetch an average business of about ₹100 crore, while a new branch would account for about ₹25 crore in the third year,” he said.",business

"The best Tamil ‘comfort films’ to watch, while self-isolating ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-best-tamil-comfort-films-to-watch-while-self-isolating/article31129307.ece,"Yes, we are tired too of seeing Friends and Breaking Bad on every recommended binge-watch list to get through days (and possibly weeks) of social distancing and self-isolation to weather the coronavirus scare. With films being our easiest escape from these worrying times, doesn’t it make sense to fall back upon regional movies we have grown up watching, fallen in love with multiple times over, and most importantly, view along with everyone at home?
So what does define a ‘comfort list’ then? It could mean different things for different people: maybe it’s something that takes you back to your high-school memories, or the first time you fell in love with a movie theatre or your favourite star, or heck, even bond with your family... after all, you are stuck with them now.
Without further ado then, here’s our list of ultimate Tamil comfort watches.. sentiment, love, action, family, class and mass all thrown in together for good measure.
Gautam Sunder’s picks:
Kushi







Long before Vijay cared too much about empowering farmers, women, the country, vegetable prices... he cared most about himself and the girl he liked. Ah simpler times, which resulted in one of the the best rom-coms of the 2000s. Kushi had it all: in SJ Suryah, a director hungry for success, two incredibly popular leads who sizzled with chemistry, a smash-hit soundtrack from Thenisai Thendral Deva that complimented the witty repartee in the film, Vivek at the peak of his powers, and the mother of all item songs in Kattipudi Kattipudida which catapulted Mumtaj to magazine front-cover fame. What’s not to love?
PS: The almost fleeting banter/ bromance between Vijayakumar and Vijay in the car is one for the ages.
Padayappa







Nope, we are not going to make this about Rajinikanth at all for a change. Of course you’ve seen the viral Neelambari meme already: she literally invented social distancing —and how! If she could do it for 18 years, we really shouldn’t be complaining about two weeks.
But we digress; like any quintessentially great Superstar offering, Padayappa plays out its winning formulaic tropes in immaculate form — and style — aided by a surprisingly effective supporting cast, led by an outstanding Ramya Krishnan.
After watching it a 100 times over the years, you know every scene by the book, yet it’s as charming, cheerful and comforting as ever. As Abbas says, What a man.. indeed.
Minnale







I was conflicted for the third choice: Vikraman’s masterful Suryavamsam which is the movie equivalent of thaachi mammam (it also gave us the best olive branch dialogue in movie history with Payasam saapdunga friend) vs Gautham Menon’s winsome, almost-before-he-came-of-age debut in Minnale that further heightened Madhavan’s Alaipayuthey stardom towards making him the chocolate boy for an entire generation.
In the end, the latter wins for three reasons: It’s endearing to see GVM’s quirks in a flat-out silly script before he became the master of romance dramas/ redefined cop portrayals; the legendary album by Harris Jayaraj in his debut that inspired nostalgic comparisons with Rahman and Raaja; and finally, Madhavan himself as Aminjikarai Rajesh wooing Reema Sen: I mean, Abbas, go back to fanboying over Rajinikanth’s biceps.
Srivatsan S’s picks:
Kadhalika Neramillai (1964)







What’s there to say/write about Kadhalika Neramillai that has not been said/written already? With two (metrosexual?) men at the centre, CV Sridhar made what could possibly be one of the best urban, madly funny, musical drama Tamil cinema has ever produced. Yes, the plot might seem silly, even dated today. But Kadhalika.. is one of those silly-good movies that was quite self-aware about its absurdness. Will this generation (yes, the ‘90s kids) ever get the greatness of Baliah? Another common factor you’d find in my ‘comfort’ list is Nagesh. His omnipresence shall continue in every listicle I write. At least I owe him this much for his contribution to Tamil comedy. There will be theses written about how to set up a great comedy stretch, like the one with Nagesh and Balaiah’s.
P. S: What great songs by the great MSV? Naalaam Naalaam is my go-to song. What’s yours?
Moondru Deivangal (1971)







Is there a more comforting watch than Moondru Deivangal, the criminally-underrated movie in Sivaji Ganesan’s oeuvre? It had everything in its premise — from Crime and Punishment to Sense and Sensibility. It tracks the lives of three morally-ambiguous characters (Sivaji Ganesan, Nagesh and Muthuraman), who are forced to take refuge in a family, which forms the moral epicentre of the film’s universe. What captivated me when I first watched the film, apart from the maligai kadai track, is the chiffon shirts worn by the characters. It might seem out of fashion now, but I’m assuming it was cool back then. The title, basically, is an allegory on our acting Deivangal — Sivaji, Nagesh and Muthuraman.
Utharavindri Ulle Vaa (1971)







Wasn’t Utharavindri Ulle Vaa far ahead of its time? I’ll tell you why. It’s a movie that escapes from Tamil cinema’s conventions. It’s a movie that doesn’t judge a woman for seeking comfort in a house, filled with (urbane?) men. Of course, the men never miss a chance to flirt with her. Their approach, however, doesn’t come across as intrusive or vulgar, and was handled with great sensitivity. In other words, it was Modern Love. Plus, it had a terrific ensemble starting with thalaivan Ravichandran and Kanchana (I had a massive crush on her, I admit). Let me not get started on Rama Prabha’s phenomenal ‘naadha’ act with Nagesh. Four men take a vacation and sh*t happens. Doesn’t it read like the synopsis of The Hangover directed by Todd Phillips? Utharavindri Ulle Vaa could have been our very own Hangover franchise.
Pradeep Kumar’s picks:
Annaamalai







Sure, the Coronavirus has put us humans on the back foot. It is forcing us to step up to the challenge it poses, and it seems like the virus would want us to prove a point at the end of it all. Who is that one man I could think of, who, when faced with similar odds, rose to the challenge and leapt up high just to prove a point? Who indeed! And cue Deva’s inspired lift off the James Bond theme music... When Rajinikanth thunders: “Assshooook” at Sarath Babu’s character, we know things were about to change. We just didn’t know it would happen over the course of a song.
Soon enough, when a vaccine is developed, it would be us (as Annaamalai) making the Coronavirus (sorry Sarath Babu) get off the chair, and I believe we will have the last laugh at the virus when we say, “Malai da... Annaamalai!” Cue Deva again for added comfort.
Kaathala Kaathala







“Lingam?” “Yes... I’m Ramalingam, he is Sundaralingam” And Nagesh goes: “I’m Chokkalingam”. One of the finest comedies to date in Tamil cinema, Kaathala Kaathala is a laugh riot, and with an absolute riot of a song like Kaasumela Kaasu Vanthu thrown in the mix for good measure. A film which brought to light the underrated actor in the late MS Viswanathan. The ‘Appane Muruga’ gags, the impersonations, an effervescent Vadivelu and some clever dialogues make Kaathala.. the perfect antidote for a gloomy day at home.
Winner







How do you better Kaathala Kaathala? Winner is the answer. The meme king of Tamil cinema, Vadivelu runs away with the film, our hearts and our laughs in this Sundar C film, which is, for all purposes and reasons, less of a film and more a 150 minute comedy marathon. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Vadivelu was the one to introduce the concept of social distancing long before it became a trend forced down on us? Hey Coronavirus! Remember: “Intha kotta thaandi neeyum vara koodathu, naanum vara maaten!”
Srinivasa Ramanujam’s picks:
Panchanthanthiram







This one is right up there in the Kamal Haasan-Crazy Mohan combination series. It tells the story of Ramachandramurthy alias Ram all right, but also gives us a peek into the lives of his four best friends and how they bring the roof down by getting themselves into all sorts of trouble. Along with rib-ticking performances, the film also packs adequate doses of sentiment and songs. Watch out for the funny one-liners...a note of caution though: if you laugh too much for a joke, you will actually miss the next.
So yes, if you want to smile, watch Panchanthanthiram. If you want to laugh, watch Panchanthanthiram. If you want to roll on the floor laughing, watch Panchanthanthiram.

What better to do in these troubled times that to watch a film whose title translates to ‘happiness’?
This Lingusamy-directed flick has every element that you would associate with a ‘rural family subject’: the ones in which a doting family just can’t live without each other. Watch out for that one special sequence in which actor Abbas, away from home, telephones his family... every one, including the household help, must speak to him. With sappy music and emotional sequences, this film will make you long for a similar family — one that’s filled with happiness and smiles.

Those young fans of Superstar Rajinikanth who are used to his ‘mass moments’ ought to watch this charming-yet-sad 1979 film to celebrate the performer in him. Rajinikanth raises a family with much love and concern, but they all leave him, one by one, in pursuit of opportunities and better lives.
This isn’t a happy film by any stretch of imagination, but the sheer way in which it communicated a point would put many message-drive films of today to shame.
In the end, we are all alone. Rajinikanth and SP Muthuraman told us this way back in 1979.",movies
‘The Office’ is Netflix’s most-watched acquired show during the coronavirus outbreak,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-office-is-netflixs-most-watched-acquired-show-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/article31128568.ece,"The Office has always been one of Netflix’s most-loved shows since it was acquired by the streaming platform, and now it seems like people are turning towards the mockumentary and Michael Scott for reassurance, more than ever before!

He was at Lamakaan’s 10th anniversary celebrations and on the occasion, spoke of his love for Urdu and shared many anecdotes from his formative years. He recalled how he overcame problems in Urdu diction because of two people — Meena Kumari and renowned lyricist (late) Majrooh Sultanpuri. He mesmerised the audience with his poems in Urdu. 
On the sidelines of the event, the actor recalls his visit to Hyderabad in 1980 to shoot for T Rama Rao’s Judaai but has known about the city because of his blockbuster movie Geeta Gaat Chal that ran for a long time at Ramakrishna Theatre in Abids. “I have many fond memories of Hyderabad; I have nawabi tastes and love Urdu. I do not treat Urdu as a language, it is part of my mind and body,” he says.
Sachin recalls his shoots in Annapurna Studios. “I had the privilege of meeting Akkineni Nageswara Rao ji in his studio. Judaai set was erected at Annapurna Studio.” Sachin decodes his journey and says his ability to adapt and be versatile helped him survive in the entertainment field. “I started my acting career when I was four-and-half. I also got fascinated with direction; Music became a part of my life and I started singing. My command over Urdu was useful as an actor and anchor. I began directing films and also writing.”
With wife Supriya Pilgaonkar and daughter Shriya also in films, Sachin admits it is impossible not to discuss movies at home but they are not obsessed with films. He credits Supriya for imparting values to their daughter. “Supriya’s parents are from the education background — her father was a principal of a college and mother, a retired school teacher. There is a lot of importance of education at home. The kind of upbringing Supriya got from her parents, she has passed it on to our children.”
Calling himself a romantic person, Sachin says he romanticises food also. He plays badminton two hours, five days a week which keeps him fit. “I play with youngsters. Though I cannot match their energy, I try.”
In the interactive two-hour session, a member in the audience wanted to know if he ever failed in life. Presenting a realistic view on stardom and success, Sachin recalled the train journey he had to Kolhapur for an audition but returned disheartened as he was not selected. 
Md. Abdul Nayeem, a faculty at IBS, (ICFAI Business School) Hyderabad said, “It was a special session. Seeing Sachin, from a Maharashtrian-Goan background, speak in Urdu and also convince us that if he can do it, we can also do it. It is just a matter of one’s dedication and love for the language undoubtedly.”",movies

“This is why our PM Narendra Modi has advised everyone to stay indoors and practise social distancing all day on March 22. In fact, in Italy, the government asked citizens to follow the same practise, but they didn’t take it seriously. Hence, thousands of lives were lost and we can see how they are suffering due to the pandemic. Let the same not happen in India,” he added.
Rajinikanth also asked people to spare a minute to remember the selfless doctors, nurses and medical workers who are risking their lives on the line to fight the coronavirus. “Let’s praise them, pray for them and their families and support them wholeheartedly by cooperating with the government’s request.”

Reality show ‘Big Brother’ contestants in Germany and Canada informed about coronavirus on live TV,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/reality-show-big-brother-contestants-in-germany-and-canada-informed-about-coronavirus-on-live-tv/article31126544.ece,"Contestants of the German reality show Big Brother were informed about the COVID-19 pandemic on camera during the show.
The contestants entered the Big Brother house over a month ago, and the first cases of COVID-19 were barely being reported from Wuhan in China when they walked in. They had no idea that the disease had acquired pandemic proportions over the past weeks.
At the last count, over 6,000 cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths have been reported in Germany, reports bbc.com.
Some housemates broke into tears when they were shown a video that made them aware of the situation outside. They were then allowed to ask questions to the show’s resident doctor. The housemates also watched video messages from their relatives. One contestant started crying, and worried about her mother who has a lung condition.
The relatives of the contestants tried to lighten up the atmosphere. Some of them joked that the Big Brother contestants were probably in the safest place in Germany right now, and asked if they could bring some toilet rolls back. There has been a shortage of the product in many western countries.
The makers decided to inform the contestants about the pandemic after facing severe criticism from viewers for keeping the 14 men and women locked inside the house in Cologne in the dark. Four contestants who joined the show on March 9 had been told not to talk about the coronavirus.
Standard rules of the game lay down that housemates would be informed about happenings in the outside world only in the case of the death of a close relative or friend, the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.
However, the broadcasting channel SAT. 1 decided to update the rulebook after “consultation with relatives” of the contestants.
German contestants were not the only ones who were not aware about the crisis.
Contestants of the Canadian Big Brother had been wondering for a while why they weren’t hearing a live audience outside during a recent eviction. While one of the contestants felt the house might be soundproof, they were not aware that live audience had been stopped from attending the show since March 12.
The housemates have since been updated “on the domestic and international status of COVID-19”, and informed that all their family members are doing fine.
The Canadian show’s resident doctor also “determined that no houseguests have exhibited any signs or symptoms related to COVID-19”.
Upon being informed, the housemates have decided to stay on the show.",movies
"There is a trend to put politics over aesthetics, says 'Midsommar' director Ari Aster",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/there-is-a-trend-to-put-politics-over-aesthetics-says-midsommar-director-ari-aster/article31126390.ece,"In 2018, Ari Aster’s Hereditary both spooked and impressed critics — a rare feat for a debut filmmaker. With the supernatural horror, starring Toni Collete, the 33-year-old American writer-director carved out a space for himself in the already cluttered genre film universe, mostly occupied by big studios and franchises. His second indie feature, Midsommar, a folk horror, took him around the world on a festival run, but the film generated a divided house. Inspired by his own break-up, the film follows a group of ignorant American students who go to a remote Swedish village and are caught in the workings of a bizarre cult. While some applauded the attempt to set a horror in broad daylight, others found it hollow and gimmicky. But irrespective, Aster has enjoyed both critical and audience attention. In an interview with The Hindu in Mumbai, Aster discusses what it means to have Hollywood horror under the festival spotlight and the politics of genre films. Excerpts from an edited interview…
As a genre filmmaker who has received critical accolades, do you see horror films experiencing a revival of sorts at recent film festivals?
 It does seem that “elevated horror” is having a moment now. [But] if you go through the last 70 years, you will find exceptions to the rule. Psycho (1960) was an exception to the bad B-horror movie. Even, Rosemary’s Baby (1968), The Exorcist (1973) and Alien (1979). It is still happening now, where people react with shock [when] a horror film [is] made artfully. There’s arguably a thin, but a clear line, between horror movies that are made cynically — these franchise horror films, which you can tell are made by a committee — and films that are coming from a more personal place. There’s a long tradition of both these kind of horror films, so for me it’s a new point in the same cycle. But there are a lot of really wonderful films coming out in the genre space today.
What do you think has triggered the appreciation of horror and genre films at festivals?
 The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby were nominated for a bunch of Oscars. The Shinning was nominated for a bunch of [Golden] Raspberry Awards, and now people don’t agree with that assessment either. It’s all kinda silly to me. Ultimately, genre films are art and of course, some aren’t. I don’t think art is an elastic term. It seems like [horror films] are being taken more seriously now than they used to be. It seems [that] there are a large number of exceptional horror movies being made now. 
But in the end, David Cronenberg started in the late 70s and worked in the 80s and 90s. He’s another example of what people are saying is happening right now, so it’s not a bubble. It’s an urge people have to put things in bubbles.






Thrills and chills: A still from Hereditary; (below) director Ari Aster.  






What’s also interesting is that a lot of contemporary horror films have political undertones, for instance, Jordon Peele’s movies. How do you view this trend, where horror films in America are becoming allegorical and not just about jump scares?
 You have film like Get Out (2017), which is more satire than horror, and it’s great satire but it’s obviously drawn from the school of Ira Levin [American novelist and playwright], and people like him. But movies and TV in general, not just the horror genre, is becoming extremely political, which I think in some ways is extremely exciting and in some ways, it can be a handicap. Because there is a trend in some corners to put politics over aesthetics, so what makes a film like Get Out so exciting that it feels sincere. You have the aesthetic, brilliantly made socio-political satire, that is not like a product of strategy but it is coming from an authentic place, which makes a film like that more valuable than maybe others. I also feel that it’s a trend to survey a bunch of films coming out at a time and say that this is a movement. Ultimately most filmmakers, or the ones that I like, are in their own little bubbles, making what they want to make and reacting to the world around them, rather than films being made by a committee and to answer the call of one agenda or another.







Speaking of the politics of Midsommar -- the film is folk horror, but there’s been a long-standing criticism of the sub-genre as exoticising a certain culture. How did you ensure not to exoticise or appear as ignorant Americans, like the characters in your film?
 Firstly, by engaging with the culture, doing a lot of research and working closely with the Swedes who are on my team. We had a Swedish production designer, producer and a lot of Swedish actors. Ultimately, exoticising them is sort of the point, and it’s part of the comedy of the film. It’s hard to say that we were doggedly avoiding one thing and pursuing another. It’s a matter of instinct, and trying to let any sort of political correctness get in the way of telling the story in the right way. 
But also trying to be politically minded and layering the film with political ideas and nods to certain things in Sweden’s history. Where to be serious and where to be cheeky? That was the question.
So where does the politics of Midsommar lie?
 I’m going to be cryptic and say that there are things in Sweden’s recent history that are suggested in the film. 
They are a little bit overt in the director’s cut and hopefully, the film gets some things that are inherent in Swedish culture that is by turns funny, charming, disturbing, strange and at the same time, the film takes a lot of liberties. I’ve heard from the Swedes who have seen the film, [that] they find it very funny and that for me is the best outcome. Of course, some not everyone is happy and they can't be. But ultimately, it is a dark comedy.",movies
‘Maa Bhoomi’ memories: Telugu actor Saichand completes 40 years in the industry ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/as-saichand-completes-40-years-in-the-industry-he-reminisces-the-making-of-maa-bhoomi/article31126055.ece,"He made a mark with his debut starrer, Maa Bhoomi a movie that defied conventional norms till then existent in Telugu cinema and, with its huge box office success paved the way for the genre of progressive movies. After a successful stint in that genre for close to 15 years, Tripuraneni Saichand opted out voluntarily from facing the arc lights to wield the megaphone for short films tracing the history of Telugu cinema. Twenty five years hence he had returned to acting with a pivotal role in Fida and played a significant cameo in Syra Narasimha Reddy, with his signature hallmark — the son of the soil.
It is celebration time for Saichand as he completes 40 years of acting this March 23. Mention this to him, he says in all humility, “No sir... Maa Bhoomi completes 40 years of its release.” Saichand reminisce his experiences during the making of Maa Bhoomi.
“G Ravindranath and B Narasinga Rao founded Chaitanya Chitra International and at the suggestion of Mrinal Sen, signed Goutam Ghosh to direct Maa Bhoomi, based on Krishan Chander’s Urdu novel Jab Khet Jage (translated into Telugu as Jaithra Yathra). Ravindranath’s brother Narayana Rao who had played the lead in Oka Oori Katha was their natural choice for the protagonist’s role.
A miracle
“Quite unexpectedly one day B Narasinga Rao sent word for me to come and meet him at their office. It was also my first meeting with Goutam Ghosh. While I was talking to Narsinga Rao, he kept on observing me from various angles. Then he and Narsinga Rao held discussions in another room. After a while, Goutam Ghosh asked me to remove my shirt. I was aghast and looked at Narsinga Rao. He smiled and said, “do as he said, I will tell you the reason later.” Still looking baffled, I removed my shirt, wondering why. Goutam Ghosh and Narsinga Rao were closeted once again. Emerged after a few minutes Ghosh smiled and said, ‘you are my hero.” I couldn’t understand a wee bit what he was saying. Then Narsinga Rao explained to me that Narayana Rao who had gone to Karlovy Vary Film Festival as part of Oka Oori Katha unit lost his passport and his return was delayed. Since they cannot afford to postpone the shooting, they were on the lookout for another actor and decided on me. I was in a dilemma. I just turned 22. I was unsure whether I can pull off such a strong character. Narsinga Rao assured me, ‘”believe in yourself, the rest we will take care.” It all happened like a miracle.
The first shot
“Since the story is set in 1940s, we needed a remote village without electric poles. Mangalaparthi in Medak district was chosen as the location. Goutam Ghosh asked me whether I smoke cigarettes. When I replied in the negative, he told me to learn to smoke beedi as the character requires it but also advised me not to make it a habit.
The first shot taken on me was as I walk with the heroine (Hansa Warnekar), I meet the newly married couple Ramulu (Yadagiri) and his wife (Samudrala Rajeswari). As soon as I saw Ramulu I have to run towards him. After the shot was over, Goutam Ghosh shouted ‘fantastic.’ However, after finishing the scene, Ghosh said ‘let’s do the first shot one more time.’ Then I understood that the first shot has not come out well but he complimented me to instil confidence in me.”
Dirty clothes
I was given used, smelly and dirty clothes to wear. I was wondering whether one needs to wear such clothes for realism’s sake. Later, Goutam Ghosh’s wife and the movie’s costume designer Nilanjana Ghosh told me since the costumes were not ready they have to borrow clothes from a local and assured me that my costumes will be ready in a couple of days.
Memorable scene
“From an oppressed rustic, Ramaiah rises to become a leader of the oppressed class. One night he visits his father (Kakarala). Worrying about his son, the father says, “Yemora Ramaiah... appudappudu nee sangati naaku bayamouthaadi. Naa okkagaanokka koduku. Aa nalugurunnaaru okadu pothe yemaithadi anukunenduku lekapaaye”(Ramaiah, at times I am worried about you. You are my only son, there is no way for me to think that I have four sons and what if, if one of them is gone). And I reply: “Prajala kosam paatubade daani kanna manchi bathukemuntadayya” (what better life is there than to work for the good of the people). It was shot in a tiny hut and I still wonder how cinematographer Kamal Nayak had done such amazing lighting in that small dwelling. After the scene was over, Goutam Ghosh’s assistant Munna ran towards me and said “you have performed like a seasoned actor, not a debutant.” Then I realised that Ramaiah has entered into me.
And the best compliment I cherish was the one from Narsinga Rao. After we shot the factory scene in Hyderabad, he told me, “With this movie, you will earn the name that your grandfather (Tripuraneni Ramaswamy) and father (Tripuraneni Gopichand) have earned.” Narsinga Rao and Pran Rao wrote the dialogues which were a live force for the movie.

Character artiste Jayaprakash Reddy’s dream Telugu film project ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jayaprakash-reddys-dream-telugu-film-project-alexander/article31126011.ece,"Character artiste Jayaprakash Reddy aka JP Reddy held a screening of the film Alexander a few days ago to a select few and he hopes it gets appreciated. JP Reddy has made this stage play popular by portraying the central character. He says he is aware that since there are no commercial elements and no hero or heroine to sell it, it might find place in the digital media if not a theatre. It has him play a retired major who establishes a helpline on his name ‘Alexander Helpline’ and counsels people who are in problems and suggests solutions to them.
The play Alexander, written by the late Poosala, has been staged 66 times times in the Telugu states. The writer believed the content will help future generations. It has been directed by Davala Satyam.
The movie takes place in a penthouse. We see Alexander living alone, waking up and wearing his military dress and singing the National Anthem and saluting the flag on his terrace every day. He loves his drink as much as he loves cutting vegetables and cooking them. He is mostly on the phone and the conversations with various people gives us an insight into their problems. Alexander has people from various walks of life, of all ages calling him and discussing their issues and he has an instant solution. They call him again later to tell him that his suggestions worked and they are thankful to him. 
There is a hitch here, the people who JP speaks to are only heard and those who watch Telugu cinema can immediately guess who these people are. Sadly none of their voices match the age of the characters they play and the intensity with which they speak is very shallow. For instance, a couple who are in their 20s, about to kill themselves on a railway track, call him and ask him for a solution which seems highly improbable and incredulous. The voices belong to popular comedians who have worked with him in many of the films and have obliged to be a part of it. Some of them have passed away years back which obviously means the film had taken time to come this far and has stripped the content of its emotion. 
These days too, we do have helplines for people with suicidal tendencies and help is offered in terms of advice and a patient listening. Here too in retirement, JP as Alexander encourages people to treat life like a battlefield and not give up. The concept is good but perhaps a new director with fresh thoughts might have dealt it differently. The high drama in the climax notwithstanding, the advice to the people in need is nice and sensible.",movies
"Netflix announces $100 million coronavirus relief fund, to help workers in the creative community",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-announces-100-million-coronavirus-relief-fund-to-help-workers-in-the-creative-community/article31123754.ece,"Streaming giant Netflix has come up with a $100 million relief fund that will be used to support members of the entertainment and creative community, who are struggling for employment in the wake of all television and film productions shut down due to the impact of the COVD-19.
Beyond helping workers on Netflix’s own productions, the company also wants to support the broader film and television industry, stated Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos.
“The COVID-19 crisis is devastating for many industries, including the creative community. Almost all television and film production has now ceased globally — leaving hundreds of thousands of crew and cast without jobs. These include electricians, carpenters and drivers, many of whom are paid hourly wages and work on a project-to-project basis. This community has supported Netflix through the good times, and we want to help them through these hard times, especially while governments are still figuring out what economic support they will provide,” he said, in a statement.
With the entertainment industry at a standstill across countries, jobs are hard to come by, especially for daily-wage earners. The Producers Guild of India had announced earlier in the week that it would be setting up a relief fund for daily-wage earners most affected by the shutdown of film, television and over-the-top productions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Most of the fund will go towards support for the hardest-hit workers on Netflix’s own productions around the world. “We’re in the process of working out exactly what this means, production by production. This is in addition to the two weeks pay we’ve already committed to the crew and cast on productions we were forced to suspend last week,” continues Sarandos.
“$15 million of the fund will go to third parties and non-profits providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast in the countries where we have a large production base,” he added.
Of that, the company will donate $1 million each to the SAG-AFTRA COVID-19 Disaster Fund, the Motion Picture & Television Fund, and the Actors Fund Emergency Assistance in the U.S., as well as $1 million between the AFC and Fondation des Artistes. Sarandos also said that Netflix was working closely with industry organisations to bolster relief efforts in Europe, Latin America and Asia, where they have a big production presence. The details of donations to groups in other countries will be announced next week.
“What’s happening is unprecedented. We are only as strong as the people we work with and Netflix is fortunate to be able to help those hardest hit in our industry through this challenging time,” Sarandos concluded.",movies
Long-tailed macaques show rich tool-use behaviour,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/long-tailed-macaques-show-rich-tool-use-behaviour/article31129250.ece,"In recent times, there has been a lot of interest among primatologists in studying object handling and tool-use in non-human primates such as apes and chimpanzees. A study from IISER Mohali has looked into how long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis umbrosus) in Greater Nicobar Island handle objects and use tools to simplify their efforts.
 The researchers observed interesting behaviour related to object manipulation and tool use in six behavioural contexts involving eight different types of objects. They also saw that males were more frequently involved in tool use than females. The results of the study are published in the International Journal of Primatology.
There is a crucial difference between tool use and object use. A tool helps the user get better outcomes. Jayashree Mazumder, first author of the paper explains in an email to The Hindu: “When we change either the function or structure... of an object, we make it a tool. But when we use an item in the manner it is supposed to be used, we are not making it a tool… it is an object use.”
Observing the long-tailed macaques from a distance of about 10 metres for close to four months, Ms Mazumder, who is working for her PhD at IISER Mohali, has developed a catalogue of the individuals studied. Each individual was identified based on marks on the face or body. “Identifying adults is easy. They are like humans with distinct features, for example, presence of black or white spots in different locations of the face, scar marks, body size, sex and behaviour. The juveniles and sub-adults were slightly difficult but they too can be identified in a similar fashion,” says Ms Mazumder. 
Stefano S.K. Kaburu, professor at the University of Wolverhampton, U.K., a co-author of the paper introduced her to the behavioural data collecting software and guided her in designing the study methods.
As per their observations, 14 individuals used tools, and tool-use was more common among males. “The biased nature of tool-use could be due to many reasons. It has been hypothesised that the weight of the individual has something to do with the tool-culture. Again, the tool activity itself also defines who uses them more often, says Ms Mazumder. 
She gives the example of how among chimpanzees, females excel in fishing, which they learn from their mothers. Males, on the other hand, become adept in hunting, which they pick up from their peers. “Thus there could be social, ecological as well as demographic factors that could decide how tool-culture is divided among the animals. But we need more studies to come to any conclusion,” she says.
According to her, the most exciting part was how the macaques decide what tool and technology to use. “Some of the macaques had few trials and errors, but it did not take them long to understand that the technique or tool was not providing the best outcome, and therefore, they were very quick in switching,” she says.
Though the long-tailed macaques are further from humans in relatedness than chimpanzees or apes, this study could offer a perspective on evolutionary origins of tool use behaviour.",science
A step closer to developing a potent drug against novel coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/a-step-closer-to-developing-a-potent-drug-against-novel-coronavirus/article31129220.ece,"Designing better antivirals that would prevent the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from infecting human cells may now become possible thanks to a team of researchers producing the crystal structure of the main protease of the virus. Main virus protease is an enzyme that processes proteins critical to virus development. An antiviral that blocks this enzyme, as in the case of drugs used against HIV virus, effectively prevents the virus from replicating. Hence, such an inhibitor will be effective against the novel coronavirus. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.
A team led by Rolf Hilgenfeld from the University of Lubeck, Germany developed the crystal structure of main protease of the virus at 1.75 angstrom resolution. And by redesigning an existing inhibitor developed for other coronaviruses, the researchers have been able to develop a potent inhibitor that can effectively block the enzyme and neutralise the novel coronavirus. “Based on the structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2,” they write.
Main virus protease is one of the best characterised drug targets among coronaviruses. The inhibitor against the main protease targets a specific region of the enzyme. And any antiviral that targets this region of the enzyme will be specific to the virus and will not be toxic to human cells. 
The researchers had earlier designed broad-spectrum inhibitors of the main proteases of other coronaviruses. One of the inhibitors showed good antiviral activity against other coronaviruses. Now, the team chose that inhibitor and modified it to increase the amount of time the drug is present in the body and to improve its solubility in plasma.
After the modification, the half-life of the inhibitor (compound 13a) increased three-fold, and the solubility improved by a factor of about 19. And to enhance the antiviral activity, the researchers further modified the inhibitor (compound 13b).
The researchers found that the IC50 (concentration of the compound to produce 50% inhibition) to inhibit the novel coronavirus is 0.90 microMolar. The inhibitor showed good potency to block the replication of the virus at half maximal effective concentration of 1.75 micromolar. In human cells infected with the novel coronavirus, a higher half maximal effective concentration of the inhibitor was required.
The metabolic stability of the 13a inhibitor originally modified was found to be “good” in both mouse and human microsomes (a fragment of endoplasmic reticulum and attached ribosomes). Even at the end of 30 minutes, around 80% of the residual compound in mouse and 60% in human cells remained metabolically stable. When the inhibitor was administered subcutaneously into mice, the inhibitor was present in the plasma for as long as four hours but was excreted via urine for up to a day.
The half-life of the compound 13b was found to be 1.8 hours. But most importantly, even after 24 hours there was some amount (33 nanogram per gram) of the compound 13b in the lung tissue. The presence of the inhibitor in the lungs even at the end of a day is particularly signifiicant as the virus affects the lungs.
The team tested for any adverse effects when mice inhaled the inhibitor 13b. “Inhalation was tolerated well and mice did not show any adverse effects, suggesting that this way, direct administration of the compound to the lungs would be possible,” they write.
Given the “favourable results” the study provides a “useful framework for development” of drugs to combat the novel coronavirus, the authors claim in the paper.",science
Musical scales are a prehistoric gift to us,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/musical-scales-are-a-prehistoric-gift-to-us/article31129214.ece,"During the last a few months, several groups have come up with interesting publications on how music affects the mind. The first is a report on March 1 from a group from Indiana University in the U.S., stating that music may overcome delirium in critically ill patients (https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2020175). Such patients experience acute mental disturbance, with speech disorder and hallucinations. The researchers attempted to try music as a drug-free intervention in 117 such patients, and gave half of them music - either their own personally chosen music (PM), or relaxing slow tempo music (STM), and compared them with a control group which was not offered music. The music was offered to the experimental group for 1 hour, twice daily for a week, and their progress noted. Results revealed that such music delivery (PM or STM, either was OK) reduced the incidence of delirium. When audio-books were offered instead of music, it did not help! The STM chosen had relaxing (60-80 beats per minute) classical music, native American flute sounds, or relaxing piano music — all preselected by a board-certified music therapist. They concluded that music is a useful non-pharmacological intervention for critically ill patients.







 
A little earlier was published a report in Current Science (118(4), 612-620; 2020 ) from Dr. B. Geethanjali of SSN College, Chennai, and her colleagues, titled “Evaluating the effect of music intervention on hypertension”. They did a randomised controlled assessment of 200 high-blood-pressure patients, measuring their heart rate, respiratory rate (RR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), and found that these parameters declined after music intervention for one month. The researchers chose to offer music intervention, along with the regular treatment, and chose the raga Hindolam (or Malkauns) — a pentatonic, ‘low arousal’, and pleasant one. (As we all know and experience, fast music and rhythms are ‘high arousal’, and excite us).
About this time also, the well known music therapist, Rajam Shankar of Hyderabad came out with a scholarly and well-researched monograph: “the healing power of music”, with details on the kind of ragas that can be used in therapy, and a detailed description of as many as 35 known Carnatic music ragas (many common to Hindustani music too), and some case studies.
Note that while America’s Indiana University researchers used music that was familiar to the patients of the ‘Western’ cultural background, and the Chennai authors used the music familiar in the South, the question is can music penetrate cultural differences with its ability to evoke emotions? This is the question that was studied by the brain researcher Nandini Chatterji Singh of the National Brain Research Centre at Manesar, Haryana, and the results of her studies have appeared six months ago in the journal PLos One (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222380). Here, she and her group played excerpts from twelve ragas from Hindustani music, online to 144 people from many parts of India, and 112 participants from non-Indian cultural backgrounds ( from the U.S., the U.K., parts of Europe, Japan, Korea). They played the aalap part (a slow paced introduction of the swaras of the raga, which define the sequence of the notes of the octave, with no rhythm) followed by the gat (the same melodic sequence of the swaras but in a faster pace, and with the accompaniment of a percussion instrument (usually a tabla) with an explicit rhythmic cycle). These were played on a sarod. When ragas such as Hansadhwani were played, both the ‘encultured’ listeners from India and the ‘non-encultured’ group from abroad felt ‘happy’ or ‘romantic’, and when the raga Marwa was played, they described a feeling of ‘sadness’. The non-encultured group responded to the rhythmic part, the gat, more readily. This, the researchers point out, is in agreement with other reports wherein American members in the audience reacted more readily when they witnessed traditional Indian classical dance. There thus appears to be an ‘universality’ in emotions in the auditory domain. They further note that a similar kind of reaction when foreigners were invited to listen to music of the Javanese people.
This raises the question of how this universality has come about, and how music across the world uses the basic tonal alphabets and rhythms. Is this an evolutionary gift to us, much as DNA sequences are? What are the origins of music in us humans? A whole field termed ‘biomusicality’ has come about since the 1990s, which studies the origins of music, what areas of the brain are involved in music processing and the functions, uses and costs of music making, and what universal features can be detected across various cultures. Some researchers have suggested that prehistoric humans played the ‘drum’ from whatever material they found suitable, and that it is an evolutionary borrowal from our ancestral cousins, the primates. And some archaeologists have looked at the kind of music from prehistoric, Paleolithic ages of humans (Neanderthals) about 4000-5000 years ago. The first such prehistoric musical instrument was a ‘flute’, made of the bone of a young bear, in Slovenia; this find has at least three holes in the hollowed out bone, perhaps there were more, which were broken away when found.
Another set of flutes, found in the Jiahu region of China, was dated even earlier (7000 -8000 years ago, using isotope dating methods), and when the researchers played them (vertically like a shehnai), they found the music reminded them of the traditional do, re, fa, so la, ti (or sa, re, ga, ma pa..) scale! (More on this in my earlier column in The Hindu, of October 14, 1999). Recall what Saint Thyagaraja wrote: Sobhillu Saptaswara ( worship the goddess presiding over the seven swaras- from the navel to the heart to the throat, tongue and the nostrils)!

"All efforts will go waste if Games are cancelled, says Mirabai Chanu",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/all-efforts-will-go-waste-if-games-are-cancelled-says-mirabai-chanu/article31136397.ece,"Mirabai Chanu has only one prayer on her lips, that the Tokyo Olympics go on as per schedule despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Otherwise, all her efforts of trying to win an Olympic medal will go down the drain.
 For the last four years, Mirabai has laboured for a successful Olympics outing but all she can think of right now is about the fate of the July 24-August 9 Games, which could be postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. 
“If the Olympics don’t happen all our efforts for the last four years will go to waste. I don’t want it to cancel, I am praying to God every day. I just want to get an Olympic medal for myself,” Mirabai said.
 Mirabai’s maiden Olympic campaign had ended in disappointment as she failed to lift the weight in any of her three attempts in the clean and jerk section.
“The pressure (of winning a medal) has changed to the Olympics and it should not be cancelled. That’s all I’m thinking. 
“The rest, training, etc. I am not worried about right now. Even if it’s postponed there will be a lot of problem because a lot can change in a short period of time for us,” she said.
 Weightlifting’s Olympic qualifying schedule has also gone haywire. 
The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) had to cancel five continental championships, including the Asia event.
 The Asian Championships, which was relocated from Kazakhstan to Tashkent in Uzbekistan was the last tournament before the Olympics for Mirabai. She had missed out on a bronze by a whisker last year.
 The Manipuri, had aimed to improve her total effort of 203kg (88kg+115kg).
“I was preparing for Asian very well. There was a lot of uncertainty whether it will happen or not. I have already qualified for the Olympics but in the Asian Championship we would have got a clear picture,” she said.
“I wanted to improve my effort here so that I could go to the Olympics high on confidence. That was the target. If the Asian Championship had taken place it would have been a good platform for me to better my performance.”",other sports
Bhaker looks at the bigger picture,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/bhaker-looks-at-the-bigger-picture/article31136358.ece,"Postponement of tournaments, and cancellation of trials and camps hardly matter at this point to Manu Bhaker, one of India’s biggest young achievers in sport. The 18-year-old is hoping to see the world win the battle against COVID-19.
The pandemic has cast serious doubts over the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, but Manu, a medal prospect at the quadrennial extravaganza, is not thinking about things beyond her control.
“Trials and events should be postponed in the current situation as there are other very important things for the world to deal with,” said Manu. 
She says the shooters are abiding by the protocols and guidelines issued by the concerned authorities. “We are strictly following the instructions of the health ministry and the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO).” 
The pistol ace was one of the few shooters who participated in a trial organised not long ago by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI). The trial was arranged to allow the shooters to register their scores after the postponement of the New Delhi ISSF World Cup and the Indian team’s pull-out from the Cyprus World Cup owing to the coronavirus outbreak.
“The camp situation was fine as there were only a few shooters, there was no large gathering and it lasted only three days.” 
Asked about the Olympic Games which has a cloud hanging over it, Manu said she will look to carry on with her routine that is part of her preparation. 
“I am relaxed at home. The current situation doesn’t affect my preparation and mindset. I am continuing with my yoga sessions, meditation and things that help me stay calm and composed.
“The Olympics, whenever it happens, is huge, so we need to be prepared. I am preparing for the Olympics as planned,” she said. “Shooting is very competitive now, especially 2019 and after, and it is evident from the scores.” 
Manu, who secured an Olympic quota for India in women’s 10m air pistol, enjoyed a successful season last year where she won five World Cup gold medals in individual and team events. 
She burst on to the National scene at the start of 2018 with a victory at the ISSF World Cup in Mexico, and has not looked back since. ",other sports

Mary Kom along with the Indian boxing squad returned home on March 12 after taking part in the Asia-Oceania Olympic qualifying event in Amman, Jordan. Mary Kom was among the nine Indian boxers who earned Olympic quota places at the event.
The Indian team — which was training in Assisi, Italy — left that country on February 27, prior to the scheduled departure owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The boxers competed in the Olympic qualifier in Amman before returning home.
“By the time the boxers returned home, they had been 14 days out of Italy, one of the worst-affected by the coronavirus. However, in the best interests of the athletes and support staff we decided that everyone would go on self-isolation on their return from Jordan,” said a BFI official.
Mary Kom, a Rajya Sabha member who was spending time with her family since her return, reportedly attended a breakfast get-together for MPs organised by President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on March 18. “It’s very difficult to ignore the President’s invite.

“We are making alternative plans — plan B, C, D — looking at different postponement time-frames,” said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays.







 
Other sources within the Olympic movement said the IOC was likely to hold an unscheduled executive board meeting as early as next week. One source told Reuters the meeting could be “very, very early next week.” The IOC did not comment.

Serbia and Croatia joined the Olympic committees and sports bodies opposing the IOC’s plans to proceed, while German former world champion fencer Max Hartung, who has already qualified for Tokyo, said he would boycott the Games.
“Japan has invested a lot of resources into the Olympics and they are adamant that the Games should go ahead, but that defies common sense and we cannot support it because human lives come first,” Serbian Olympic Committee president Vanja Udovicic said.
His Croatian counterpart, Zlatko Matesa, said it was “impossible” to proceed with the Olympics under the current circumstances.
Germany’s Hartung, a four-times European champion who also heads the German Olympic Committee’s athletes’ commission, said he could no longer justify competing in Tokyo and said everyone had to play their part in stopping the spread of the virus. “I have taken my decision.

Winfrey announced the show on social media and for its first episode, she sat down with actor Idris Elba via Facetime to talk about his coronavirus diagnosis.
“Like millions of people all over the world, I’ve been staying safer at home for over a week now. I know a lot of people are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, & uncertain. Because of that, I want to offer some hope & gather thought leaders & people going through it to add some perspective. Which is why I FaceTimed @idriselba and his wife Sabrina who are safely quarantined together after he tested positive for COVID-19. Idris fills me in on his journey and Sabrina reveals the result of her test after they decided to quarantine together,” Winfrey posted.
In the episode, Elba, 47, said he has been dodging interviews with the press but wanted to talk to Winfrey as a “friend” because “journalistic approach to doing things like this is probably one of the best“.
About his decision to go public with his diagnosis, Elba said, “COVID-19 has come to a sort of pressure point right now but for the last two weeks, it’s been a talking point and I really felt that a lot of people didn’t know what was gonna come ... It didn’t really feel relatable. There were a bunch of theories going around: it’s a conspiracy! Is it even real?""
“And when I got tested and it came back positive, it became very real. It was always real for me but it became very real. And I just felt compelled to tell people this is very real. Someone like myself, in the public eye, can press a button and 30 million people will get a message the next day, I think is a really important component in the messaging around COVID-19 right now,” the actor said.
Sabrina, who sat besides Elba, said she has also been tested positive for COVID-19.

Ask Us March 21 ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ask-us-march-21/article31131060.ece,"Q. My spouse, a homemaker, plans to trade in the stock market with an investment of less than ₹1 lakh. Kindly advise on the tax implications of trading in equities (intraday trade and others). 
Brokers informed us they collect various statutory charges apart from their brokerage. I also want to know whether one should pay tax on the profit earned per annum or on the basis of turnover. If so, what is the rate and how should she file I-T returns? Kindly advise.
V. Sarath
A. Stock market trading is a risky activity with a high possibility of capital losses. 
We hope your spouse has studied companies and markets carefully and has a risk-management strategy in place before undertaking this.
The profit you make on stock trading can be subject to income tax as long and short-term capital gains or taxed as business income, which can be speculative or non- speculative. 
Capital gains taxation usually applies to investors in stocks — those who take delivery of their positions and hold their stocks for one day or more. Whether your profits from trading get treated as long-term or short-term capital gains depends on how long you held the stock before selling them. 
If you hold a stock for 12 months or more, the profit you make on selling (over and above your purchase price) get treated as long-term capital gains. All long-term capital gains you make during a year will be taxed at a flat 10% (without indexation benefits) after exempting ₹1 lakh of such gains each year. 
If you hold a stock that you bought for between 1 day and 12 months, the profit you make on the sale will be treated as short-term capital gains and taxed at a flat 15%. 
 The profit you make through intraday trading in the cash markets (where you don’t take delivery but close out the position within a session) is usually treated as business income. 
Business income is clubbed with your other sources of income (say salary, interest, rent etc) and taxed at the income tax slab rate applicable to you. When your trading profit is classified as business income, you are allowed to deduct all the costs you incurred towards this activity (securities transaction tax, brokerage, Internet and phone bills) from your total income before calculating the tax on it. 
For traders with no other source of income apart from trading, the income tax rate could work out to be quite low in this route, because they would get taxed at the lower slab rates (zero tax on up to ₹2.5 lakh a year and 5% on the excess up to ₹5 lakh). Losses on speculative business income can be carried forward but only set off against profit from similar income in future years. 
Apart from income tax, all transactions through the stock exchanges in listed securities in India attract the securities transaction tax (STT) which will be automatically charged by your broker on the trade. 
STT is levied at 0.1% of the transaction value on delivery-based purchases or sales of shares and at 0.025% on the sale transaction on intraday trades or non-delivery trades. 
Besides the brokerage payable to the broker on your turnover, States levy stamp duty at different rates on the total turnover, exchanges levy transaction charges, SEBI levies a flat turnover fee and you need to pay GST at 18% on the brokerage and transaction costs. The depository you are with may levy charges too. 
As the classification of your profit from stock market trades as capital gains or business income can be subject to interpretation, it would be best to use a qualified accountant to file your returns if you engage in stock trading. ",business
Chhavi Thakur: Making the difference for Prabhu Deva,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/making-the-difference-for-prabhu-deva/article31136485.ece,"Artistes sporting flashy costumes for dance sequences was a thing in the ’90s. Prabhudheva was no different. His choice of costumes stood out like his choreography — which had him bend his body and, with it, your mind. 
In recent times, however, the actor-filmmaker’s apparel choice has reflected a generational change, although his penchant for being a part of foot-tapping numbers filmed with an elaborately designed and constructed set as backdrop remains. Whether it is Devi, Gulaebaghavali or the recently-released Street Dancer 3D, Prabhudheva’s outfits set the actor apart but does it subtly.
Credit for his changeover, the actor attests, to his stylist Chhavi Thakur, whom we recently caught up with when the shoot for Bagheera, the Adhik Ravichandran film that has Prabhudheva essay multiple characters, was halted due to the Coronavirus scare. A Delhiite based in Mumbai, Chhavi switched over from a career as cabin crew with the now-defunct Jet Airways to be a stylist in films.

“I knew in my mind that [being an air hostess] wasn’t going to be a long term career. When I wanted to change [career], I wanted to pursue something where I knew I could give my 100% and flourish. That is how it happened,” she says. 
For someone without much on-the-job experience in fashion, Chhavi adds that she relied on YouTube videos and Google to brush up her knowledge. And when she landed her first opportunity, as an assistant in the costume department, it was for the Sanjay Gupta film Shootout at Wadala (2013).
“It is not everyday you get to work on a period film (Shootout at Wadala was set in the ’80s) as your first project. I learnt a lot on how to age clothes, and the kind of research I did with the film’s stylist to understand the kind of clothes that were used then...it gave me a lot of insight into the industry,” she says. 
After Shootout at Wadala came the offer to work for National Award-winning costume designer Neeta Lulla. “I jumped at the opportunity. She is very hands-on with her work. Most of the designers let their assistants handle things on set. But she was out there doing her work to perfection, keeping actors at ease and providing the director with what he/she wants,” she adds.
That work ethic she absorbed from Neeta could well be why Adhik Ravichandran speaks in hyperbole when asked of her contribution in Bagheera. “She is the mastermind [for Bagheera’s costumes]. The film has a lot of characters, and each one has its own way of dressing, colours and styles. To handle these many characters is difficult for a costume stylist, but the outfits she has picked makes the characters stand out. When the first look was released, many were asking what Prabhu master was wearing,” says Adhik.

While both Adhik and Chhavi hold the mystery of Bagheera’s “different characters” close to their chest, the latter hints that there weren’t many references she could rely on for drawing up her outfit choices — unlike the previous Prabhudheva films she worked on like Devi or the unreleased film Yung Mung Sung. 
“Yung Mung Sung is a period film, and we wanted to depict the characters as kung fu students of a bygone era. I had to watch a lot of kung fu films as homework. In Devi, the director (AL Vijay) wanted a South Indian rural look for characters; we discussed about the jewellery that elderly women wear. I watched a lot of Tamil films because I wanted to make myself aware of the culture before delivering,” she says.
“In Bagheera, we have crafted the looks based on the character’s personality trait and age. There is a lot of out-of-the-box thinking involved,” she adds.
Like in any profession, costume designing and styling is also a cut throat business. “You have to make your mark, especially since there are a lot of stylists and designers who cater to the same person,” says Chhavi. She says she owes it to Prabhudheva for choosing her from the crowd, “He is the person responsible for what I am today. In that sense, he is my godfather [in cinema]. I never thought I’d be an air hostess or a stylist. I keep evolving with the moment,” she concludes.",movies
Cover for a pandemic,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cover-for-a-pandemic/article31131086.ece,"While pandemics such as COVID-19 are not new to the world, it is important to stay protected in every manner possible. While you may take all required precautionary measures such as maintaining social distancing to stay protected, what is more important here is to understand how you can secure your health. 
In case you get infected by COVID-19, you must have a comprehensive health insurance plan to coverhospitalisation expenses. 
If you are still confused as to whether your health insurance policy will cover hospitalisation expenses incurred due to COVID-19, it is important for you to know that any claim for COVID-19 will be payable by your insurer if you are hospitalised for at least 24 hours.
As per a circular from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to all health insurers regarding the guidelines on handling of claims reported under COVID-19, the regulator has made it clear that all such claims shall be handled as per the usual norms i.e. just like any other ailment requiring hospitalisation. 
As per the guidelines, all claims will be processed as per regular norms and will be covered as any other illness.
 However, it is mandatory for the policyholder to stay hospitalised for a minimum of 24 hours. 
IRDAI has even made it clear that the entire cost of admissible medical expenses during the course of treatment, including the treatment during quarantine period, shall be settled in accordance with the regular health insurance policy.
Also, the infection caused due to COVID-19 does not fall under the pre-existing disease category and hence, the claims will be covered for the illness from day one. Every basic health insurance plan will compensate the policyholder for expenses incurred on pre-hospitalisation, post-hospitalisation, in-patient treatment, OPD and ambulance expenses, should one seek treatment for COVID-19.
 While the above features are for an indemnity-based health plan, those looking for a fixed benefit health plan that compensates them for loss of income due to hospitalisation following COVID-19 can invest in the fixed benefit health plan offered by Digit Insurance. 
Offered under the IRDAI’s regulatory sandbox framework, Health Care Plus plan is available for a sum insured of between ₹25,000 and ₹2 lakh. 
The premiums start at ₹299 at the lower end, while the maximum sum insured entails a premium of ₹2,027 plus GST. 
As to the payout process, in case a policyholder tests positive for COVID-19, the insurer will pay out the entire sum insured. If a quarantine is advised in a government or a military hospital, the insurer will pay 50% of the sum insured. 
Retired people may consider it for additional benefits even if they have a standalone plan since they are more vulnerable to the virus. Those suffering from symptoms of cold or respiratory diseases will not be able to purchase this plan.

Why has the rupee fallen against the dollar?,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/why-has-the-rupee-fallen-against-the-dollar/article31131349.ece,"The story so far: The rupee slumped on Friday to a record closing low of 75.20 against the U.S. dollar as deepening concerns about the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic sent global investors scurrying to dump most assets, especially emerging market holdings, and opt for cash and the relative safety of the greenback. The rupee has now depreciated by more than 5.3% in 2020, with the bulk of its losses, a 4.1% slide, having occurred in March.
Just as it happened in 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the widespread economic uncertainty triggered by the latest COVID-19 outbreak has forced most investors and businesses across the world to seek to conserve that most crucial asset during times of crisis: cash and more specifically the U.S. dollar. In 2008, the dollar strengthened about 22% against the Euro as enterprises, especially in the world’s largest economy, hoarded the U.S. currency. 
Since the start of the month, overseas investors have dumped Indian equities and debt on a scale not seen since the taper tantrum of 2013, when news that the U.S. was going to gradually wind down its GFC-triggered quantitative easing spurred an exodus out of emerging market assets. As on March 20, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had sold a net ₹95,485 crore, or more than $12 billion, of shares and bonds. This outflow has coincided with the sharp fall in the equity market’s key gauge, the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex, which has slumped 22% so far in March.
The rupee’s decline in March has been part of a broad trend as most currencies across the globe have weakened against their U.S. counterpart. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, has gained almost 4% so far this month. The risk aversion as a result of the pandemic triggered by the global outbreak of COVID-19 has been so intense that it has not spared most perceived safe havens including U.S. Treasuries (government bonds) and significantly even gold. The yellow metal too has been sold by investors looking to hold the most liquid and most fungible of all assets — the U.S. dollar.
Given that the increasing possibility of the global economy heading into a recession has been a key driver of the dollar’s appreciation against other currencies, including the rupee, there is clearly more pain ahead for the Indian currency. Add to it the fact that India’s own domestic economy has been struggling to reverse an extended slowdown — with both private consumption and investment by businesses substantially becalmed — and it is hard to see sentiment on the rupee improving appreciably in the short-term.
However, a few offsetting factors offer just a little comfort. For one, India’s foreign exchange reserves are still at a fairly robust level and as on March 13 amounted to a total of almost $482 billion. Armed with this war chest, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stepped in every now and then, both to smooth volatility in the foreign exchange market and to ensure that a sudden shortage of dollar supply does not exacerbate the weakening trend in the rupee. The central bank, in fact, last week provided $2-billion of dollar liquidity through a forex swap on Monday, and is set to provide a similar line on March 23 as well.
Also, the price of oil, which is one the largest contributors to India’s import bill, has dramatically declined this month with Brent crude oil futures having slumped more than 46% to $26.98 as on March 20. With neither Saudi Arabia nor Russia appearing to be in any hurry to de-escalate their price war, and energy demand likely to remain depressed in the foreseeable future on account of the global economic downturn, oil may remain one source of respite for the rupee.
And were the U.S. economy itself to go beyond a recession and possibly head for a massive unemployment featuring depression — if more States join California in enforcing severe movement curbs such as the large coastal State’s statewide “stay-in-place” order to contain the spread of the viral pandemic —the dollar too could become a risky holding.
Still, to complicate matters on the outlook, the RBI is most likely to cut interest rates in the very near future to support the sagging economy at this juncture, a move that could potentially again add to the downward pressure on the rupee.",economy
Diversification of investment is not in numbers,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/diversification-of-investment-is-not-in-numbers/article31131075.ece,"We all like to diversify our investments. We spread our fixed deposits among three or four banks as we believe that the likelihood of all these banks failing to repay our deposits at maturity is low. Using the same logic, we also invest in several equity funds. However, investing in multiple investment products may not, necessarily, reduce investment risk.
Suppose you invest in five different equity funds to diversify your investment risk. What if all of them have large holdings in the same stocks, say, Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank? If these stocks decline sharply, so will the net asset value (NAV) of all these funds. So, investing across multiple funds may not necessarily prevent your investments from declining in value.
Diversification is not about spreading your investment across multiple products. It is about how each of these investment products correlate with (or relate to) each other. Ideally, you want your equity investment products to increase in value when the market moves up. 
On the flip side, you want some of these investment products to move up when other products in your portfolio move down in line with the market.
But, gathering such products to form a portfolio requires application of rigorous statistical and mathematical tools. This is because you have to determine how these products relate to each other when markets move up as well as when they drop. Now, most investors cannot engage in such exercise for want of time and effort. So, what should you do? Stop buying multiple investment products. 
It will save you from the ordeal of managing a bulky portfolio. Also, you will not draw false comfort that you have reduced your investment risk. That said, you should draw comfort from the fact that you are already reducing risk through your asset allocation process. This involves allocating your investments across assets such as equity and commodities. You should preferably use two assets in your goal-based portfolios — one that offers higher-than-expected return and the other that provides stable cash flows.
 Assume you want to buy a house ten years hence and decide to invest in equity and bonds. By bonds, we mean any interest-bearing instrument offering you stable cash flows, and a pre-defined value at maturity. It is easier to map cash flows from bonds to the cash flows needed to achieve your goals. For goal-based portfolios, bond investments should typically be in bank deposits, public provident fund and tax-free bonds. They must preferably pay interest at maturity, not annually. So, if you are investing to accumulate money to finance your vacation three years hence, you should invest in a three-year recurring bank deposit (RD). Your equity investments will be in mutual funds, preferably a Nifty Index fund.
Now, your bond investments will provide stability to your portfolio because of the known cash flows at maturity. But bonds offer low post-tax returns because of higher tax rate and lower-than-expected return, and do not beat inflation.
Hence, you need equity investments. While equity offers higher-than- expected return, the cash flow you will receive when you sell your equity investments is uncertain. Diversification is, therefore, all about how judiciously you mix a higher-than-expected-return asset (equity) with a stable-return asset (bonds). We believe it is best you pay greater attention to your asset allocation — the proportion of equity and bonds in each of your goal-based portfolios. Often, investing in one RD and in one index fund will suffice to achieving a goal.

Driving tips can light up an investor’s path,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/driving-tips-can-light-upan-investors-path/article31131049.ece,"Both driving and investing / savings are integral parts of our lives. Both take an individual from point X to point Y either physically or financially.
In driving, you use the road to travel and reach your physical destination. In investing, you use various investment assets such as equity, gold, debt, real estate, fixed deposit or insurance, use the platform (an analogy to the road) to achieve your financial goals in a timely and safe manner. 
The time taken to reach the destination or financial goal, the speed (read return on investment) and safety (permanent loss of capital) and volatility (read risk involved in investing in various types of assets) and the intermediate experience are all based on four important factors: the number of vehicles on the road; other drivers’ behaviour; your own behaviour while driving; and, the ability of the vehicle.
The number of vehicles on the road is likely to be high during peak hours. In the early hours, driving will be peaceful because of fewer vehicles on road. 
Driving in the early hours is like investing in years such as 2008 (post-correction) or 2012 or when no one wanted to invest in equity markets. 
There is less competition and you can pick and choose funds or stocks at a reasonable valuation that could yield desired returns over a long period. 
Driving in peak hour traffic is like investing during a crazy market run such as in 2007 or 2017, when there is heavy competition. This could lead to higher valuations and hence give lower returns — due to either prices being stagnant or due to a significant fall in prices, as was the case with the correction in mid- and small-caps in the 2018-2019 period.
Equity investing in the short term is largely affected by the behaviour of market participants. Over the last 1-2 years, price correction in a lot of mid- and small-cap companies have been severe due to valuation de-rating (this stems from a lower expectation of future growth from market participants). 
Being cautious during market highs and being aggressive when the market falls is essential to realising better returns. 
During a peak market, you need to manage risk by investing in tier-1 (ie, the best companies) and by not investing in tier-2 and -3 companies though the latter’s valuation may seem lower and could see higher speculative activity.
During market lows, build a portfolio for future returns by investing in firms that have the balance sheet to fund growth using internal cashflows and which have large reinvestment opportunity; avoid investing in ‘cigar butt’ ideas where only valuation re-rating is possible and no growth in intrinsic value may be expected.
Change your behaviour if you want to change what happens to you or around you. By wearing a seat belt, coupled with cautious driving, you choose to drive safe and avoid major accidents, or at least protect yourself in a mishap should one take place. 
The probability of an accident is low but its impact could be high. In investing, the amount to be invested in various assets such as equities and fixed deposits needs to be considered based on the risk tolerance of the investor and the time factor.
A poor decision could mean a portfolio that belies expectation. For example, investing in equities with a short time horizon could lead to loss and increase the risk level of the portfolio. Similarly, investors need to step up purchase of equity assets at lower multiples (valuations) to improve returns. 
A fall in the markets can been seen either as a risk or as an opportunity. A temporary fall in the market is considered risky by investors who panic and exit the market; the same temporary fall is seen as a call to action by those who wish to deploy capital for the long term. 
Any net saver should welcome a fall in markets as the net incremental money is deployed at lower levels and not at higher levels. A market fall gives investors enough time and opportunity to research on companies or funds and invest at attractive valuations. (ie, good stocks bought post a crisis such as in 2008, 2013 and early 2016 have, in general, yielded better returns). 
Being defensive in a declining market is the equivalent of driving too slow in a highway where you need to be in top gear instead of in third gear. 
Not taking risk by accepting short-term volatility in the portfolio could lead to long-term risk of not reaching the desired corpus target. 
Some vehicles are designed for high speeds and some, for reasonable speeds. You choose a vehicle or an investment instrument based on your comfort and need. If your style fits an aggressive form of driving, then you need a vehicle with a high-power engine. 
Similarly, in investing too, choose instruments such as stocks, mutual funds or fixed deposits depending on what suits your temperament and what your needs are, to reach your financial goals in a safe and timely manner.
Happy Investing!

To be or not to be?: Four philosophy podcasts you can listen to during Coronavirus lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/to-be-or-not-to-be-four-philosophy-podcasts-you-can-listen-to-during-coronavirus-lockdown/article31144445.ece,"Staying indoors for a while? We have you covered. For your weekly list of podcasts, we begin with the ones that cover philosophy. To be or not to be? You might get answers to such questions. Or, perhaps, you will end up with more existential dilemmas (like ‘Did I order an Oreo milkshake at the cafe yesterday out of free will or am I just part of a simulation?’) Nevertheless, we hope the following podcasts make you ponder about topics that aren’t considered quotidian.
One of the major criticisms of this podcast is that it doesn’t delve deep enough on philosophical concepts. Fair enough. This podcast won’t suffice if you are looking to get a PhD on the works of Plato. But podcaster Stephen West doesn’t promise that. He aims to introduce listeners to philosophy, usually with examples that are relatable. 







You won’t feel like you are in a lecture hall. It is ideal, albeit not necessary, to start listening from the first episode as West covers philosophers through the ages — from the shabbily clothed Socrates, who roamed the streets of ancient Greece to the more fashionable 20th-century American philosopher Robert Nozick and others.
Episode length: 30+ minutes (on average). Available on: philosophizethis.org, Spotify, Apple Podcast and more. 
It is self-described as “A philosophy podcast by some guys who were at one point set on doing philosophy for a living, but then thought better of it.”
Mark Linsenmayer, Seth Paskin and Wes Alwan — classmates at University of Texas, doing a master's degree in Philosophy — along with Dylan Casey run this podcast, which has crossed over 200 episodes.







With more than 27 million downloads since its inception, The Partially Examined Life Philosophy Podcast marked its 10th year anniversary last April with a public discussion of Aldous Huxley's iconic novel Brave New World at Manhattan. 
Episodes usually involve the four guys discussing the topic with a special guest (including, at times, Hollywood celebrities) — you are, hence, spared of montone. And, the tone of the discussion itself is casual. 
Episode length: 50+ minutes (on average). Available on partiallyexaminedlife.com, YouTube, Spotify and more. 







With three Stanford University professors (John Perry, Ken Taylor, and Joshua Landy) co-hosting the show, Philosophy Talk is probably the most academic podcast in this list. It’s a bit formal but never boring. The show is produced by KALW, a San Francisco-based public radio station, on behalf of Stanford University, as part of its Humanities Outreach Initiative. 
The usually hour-long show is available in chunks on major podcast-streaming apps. It focuses on a philosophical concept or a philosopher and usually features an expert on the episode’s topic. As its motto suggests -- “the program that questions everything, except your intelligence” -- the topics vary from Descartes to genetic engineering.
Episode length: 10+ minutes (on average). Available on: philosophytalk.org, Google Podcasts, Spotify and more.







Well, this isn’t strictly philosophy. You probably won’t find discussions and debates on Friedrich Nietzsche on BBC’s The Big Idea. The show, instead, talks about the events and concepts that have shaped and are shaping the world. It picks the best ideas from economics to psychology, neuroscience to philosophy, political science to anthropology, and makes them into nine-minute, easy-to-follow episodes. 
It introduces an idea and provokes your thoughts on it. For instance, in the last episode on the podcast (published in September 2018) on afterlife, American philosopher Samuel Scheffler asks, “Suppose you knew that after your natural death the human race would die out – perhaps, for some reason, humans had become infertile. How would that alter how you live your life?”

How the gaming community is benefitting from social distancing,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/muli-players-fitness-experiences-gamified-learning-and-more-heres-why-the-gaming-community-is-benefitting-from-social-distancing/article31143959.ece,"Movie theatres and sports grounds might be experiencing restrictions but a small number of groups have benefited from the ongoing social distancing, and one of them is gamers. Yes, being stuck at home does have its perks.
Social media allows interaction to a certain point. You can rarely go beyond double-tapping for a like, popping in a comment or dropping a DM, but social gaming offers new types of communication. One is not just playing a game and streaming the progress live; there are active live chats for commentary and multi-player options. 
Another bright side: no longer do you have to go out to buy a game disc (a reality which ended almost a decade ago), you can just install the game from the comfort of your couch.
Cosplayer Sameer Bundela is in lockdown in the U.S., having represented India at Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo 2020. Unable to explore the tourist sites, he has been indulging in a fair bit of gaming until the travel bans and social distancing restrictions lift, so that he may return home to Mumbai. “I have been able to discover games, especially on mobile, which I would not have been able to otherwise! Gaming is also a great heart-lightener as I can play with my friends back home. I’ve played multiplayer games like Call Of Duty: Warzone and Teamfight Tactics but I always find my way back to Dota.”

Developed by Electronic Arts, FIFA has seen more gaming sessions across India — given going outside in groups is discouraged. The game franchise is one of the biggest in the industry with annual releases since 1993, selling more than 350 million copies worldwide. FIFA falls into the sports simulation category of gaming, with trademark technologies such as Human Intelligence and True Player Motion. Sri Krishna Charan, a self-proclaimed FIFA addict living in Chennai, has been working from home, too. He says, “Since I live alone, it’s all I’ve been doing to beat the stress. Plus it’s a great way to connect with friends overseas. We’ve all been bingeing on FIFA 20 as well as Call Of Duty mobile battle royales.” 
While he is not sure how long this shutdown will last, he still loves a good in-person live game-a-thon. “However, if social distancing is the way to go for a few months, then remotely playing together is the only option.”

Former gaming journalist Gagan Gupta, in Mumbai, has been gaming his whole life and has been working from home for the last year, so he sheds some light on what is trending in this industry. “MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role playing games) like World Of Warcraft and Final Fantasy are actually on the lower-end in terms of popularity in India, as of the past few years. I’m seeing a lot of MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) games — like League Of Legends and Dota — as well as PUBG trending now,” he points out, “There are other popular games like Overwatch. I obviously play with my friends so I’ve been playing Destiny 2 (a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter) and Doom Eternal (a first-person shooter).” Gagan adds that he does not stream his gaming sessions at all.
According to Amazon-owned gaming streaming platform Twitch, there are just over 100 active Twitch streamers in the country. In the light of social distancing, the platform has seen a surge in views over the past couple of weeks globally. The idea with Twitch is that people follow their favourite let’s-players live-broadcast their progress in video games. Though the service is free, there are additional features such as subscriptions to each let’s-player costs around ₹375. 






A screenshot of Twitch TV, the app for televisions
 






Data from Twitch Tracker shows that just between March 1 and March 15, there was a boost of 2,18,500 live viewers across channels and 14,500 active live channels, around the world. And, of course, on weekends, there are 16% more viewers than on weekdays; for them there are 17% more streams to choose from on Twitch. 
For the younglingsOf course, students at home from school will not have access to Twitch but they do have their own gaming experiences, but all to gamify learning and well-being.STEPapp by Eduisfun Technologies is an educational gaming app launched recently. The company had approached the Tamil Nadu State government to launch this app in government schools so to help children learn maths and sciences concepts faster. Family favourite Animal Crossing is widely popular among families who want to steer away from the usual tropes of video games. On March 20, Nintendo-exclusive Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released and Delhi-based Leena Gupta says her two children, aged 8 and 11, were long awaiting for the release. “While working from home, I have to understand that video games are not their babysitter but a supplementary recreation to their existing at-home school syllabus while also helping them improve reflexes.” During the social distancing, Nintendo’s Ring Fit Adventure sold out internationally, too. The exercising action-RPG, popular across all ages, has a fitness-focussed experience in which there are two physical components: the Ring-Con, a flexible, hard-plastic ring held by the player and which one Joy-Con slots into, and a Leg Strap, a piece of fabric affixed to the user's leg that holds the other Joy-Con.
Plus, in the first 20 days of March, Twitch had already observed 671 million hours of livestream gaming while the average hours per month is around 750 million. 
Why have let’s players become such a big deal now? A form of passive gaming for viewers who vicariously live through the moves made by the let’s-player, they also become a way to connect with a gamer. Some of the big let’s-players right now, locally and internationally, include TheRadBrad, Ninja, Indian Gamer and, of course, PewDiePie. “Watching someone is a skill-based experience. You watch to pick up on tips and to understand their choices, and it is a great entertainer, just like live sports,” explains Gagan.
Twitch is quite aware of the boost; in a March 17 blog post titled ‘How to use Twitch to support charities responding to COVID-19’, the company has listed out ways for gamers to link up with charities — such as Italian Red Cross, Save The Children, Direct Relief — which are active on the platform. They have also detailed a list of Best Practices for charity streams.
Whatever the (stereotypical) image of a gamer that comes to mind, one cannot refute that they have mastered social distancing long before many of us could. Want to join this gaming revolution? We recommend Minecraft (of course), The Walking Dead, Firewatch, Mario Party, Monument Valley, Pokemon Go and Sayonara: Wild Hearts.",technology
Tech giants partner with U.S. government to provide resources for COVID-19 research,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/tech-giants-partner-with-us-government-to-provide-resources-for-covid-19-research/article31140458.ece,"
U.S.-based global tech giants, including IBM, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have partnered with the White House to “unleash the power of American supercomputing resources” for combating the novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump has said.
From volunteering to manufacturing masks and ventilators to ramping up production of essential medical supplies and general items, the country’s private sector have joined America’s war against coronavirus in a big way, Trump said on Sunday, while launching a new public-private consortium organised by the White House, the Department of Energy and tech company IBM.
“The outpouring from the private sector (in the fight against coronavirus) has been extraordinary,” he said 
The public-private consortium will “unleash the power of American super computing resources” to fight the deadly viral infection, the President said. 
IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the National Science Foundation and the NASA will be primarily computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccines.
“They’ll be working along with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and all of the people that are working on this (COVID-19 research),” Trump said.
The NIH is the primary agency of the U.S. government responsible for biomedical and public health research.
Trump said U.S.-based multinational conglomerate Honeywell will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks for the U.S. government strategic national stockpile. These masks will then be delivered to various States. 
“This expansion is already under way and it’s going to provide a lot of jobs for that state (Rhode Island), probably around 500,” Trump said. 
The President said the White House has been receiving calls from private sector companies, volunteering to manufacture essential commodities.
“Hanes, who makes things of cotton...They call us and said we’re going to make millions of masks. We got a call today the head of 3M, they’re going to make tremendous products, and they’re more or less in that business,” he said, adding that major auto manufacturers, like the General Motors and the Ford, too have talked to the White House about manufacturing ventilators.",technology

The 79-year-old Spanish tenor revealed his diagnosis on his Facebook page.
“I feel it is my moral duty to announce to you that I have tested positive for COVID-19. My Family and I are all in self-isolation for as long as it is deemed medically necessary,” he wrote.
Domnigo said he decided to get tested after experiencing “fever and cough symptoms”, but he and his family are in “good health” now.
“I beg everyone to be extremely careful, follow the basic guidelines by washing your hands frequently, keeping at least a six-foot distance from others, doing everything you can to stop the virus from spreading and please, above all, stay home if you can,” he wrote.
“Together we can fight this virus and stop the current worldwide crisis, so we can hopefully return to our normal daily lives very soon. Please follow your local government’s guidelines and regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community,” Domingo added.
Earlier this year, Domingo was in the news for facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and apologised for ""the hurt"" caused to his accusers, saying he accepted full responsibility for his actions.

"Harvey Weinstein tests positive for coronavirus in prison, says official",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-prison-says-union-official/article31139937.ece,"Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who is serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the head of the state corrections officers union.
Weinstein, 68, has been placed in isolation at Wende Correctional Facility, said Michael Powers, president of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association.
Powers said he learned that the test came back positive on Sunday morning and is concerned about the corrections officers, who he said lack proper protective equipment. Several staff have been quarantined, Powers said.
Weinstein arrived at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison east of Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday after being housed at New York City's Rikers Island jail.
He was sentenced to 23 years in prison on March 11 for sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress.
Following the sentencing, Weinstein spent time at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for heart problems, according to his spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer. He also has other medical issues, including diabetes and high blood pressure.
A lawyer for Weinstein said on Sunday night that his legal team had not been notified of the coronavirus diagnosis. ”Given Mr. Weinstein's state of health, we are of course concerned, if this is the case, and we are vigilantly monitoring the situation,” said lawyer Imran Ansari, who is based in New York.
The Niagara Gazette, a local newspaper in upstate New York, reported that Weinstein had tested positive for the highly contagious virus earlier Sunday, citing anonymous officials.
Two prisoners at the Wende Facility have confirmed cases of COVID-19, a state prison official told Reuters. The official said he could not comment on any individual prisoner's medical record.
The official told Reuters that, with each confirmed case, the Department of Corrections works with the Department of Health to identify potentially exposed people.
Mark David Chapman, who murdered Beatle John Lennon in 1980, served some of his time at Wende Correctional Facility, as did Robert Chambers, dubbed the “Preppie killer,” who strangled 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in New York Citys Central Park in 1986.
Weinstein's conviction was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men.
More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He has denied the allegations, saying any sex was consensual.
Weinstein also faces separate sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.
Weinstein won an Academy Award for producing Shakespeare in Love and was responsible for other acclaimed films including Pulp Fiction, The English Patient and Gangs of New York. ",entertainment
Is Chennai the city of sailors or the turf of surfers?,https://www.thehindu.com/society/is-chennai-the-city-of-sailors-or-the-turf-of-surfers/article31143783.ece,"I am red in the face. “There’s nothing to be scared of,” says the ebony-tinted, six-foot-tall surfing coach. I don’t tell him that my ruddy complexion has less to do with fear and more to do with the exertions of holding my tummy in for the better part of the last hour.
I am near Kovalam, Chennai’s surfing haven, surrounded by lithe men and women who look like they have been poured into their body suits. Everyone is here to learn to be riders on the storm — like the thousands before who have been spurred by the city’s enthusiastic surfing community. Led in the initial years by men from the local fishing villages, Kovalam now hosts its own surf festival and is home to many a prize-winning surfer. 
Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes and super model-turned-running evangelist Milind Soman are familiar faces here.
We limber up on the copper sands — stretches, lunges, burpees and the ‘pop-up’ that teaches you how to stand up in water. I am so out of breath that I am tempted to slip away and hide behind the coconut water vendor. Just then, Coach asks each of us to pick a surf board; I come up trumps with the pink one named ‘Padillac’. 
“We’ll start with 10 metres in,” says Coach. I paddle in, so ungracefully that I might as well be auditioning for ‘jackass of the day’. Wave after wave peels away and scatters on the beach; I’m still prone on the board, looking nowhere like the man in my earliest surfing memory — the Apollo riding the waves in the Old Spice ad.
Alongside are a man and his dog balancing on the surfboard with a skill that is amazing. The dog probably has its own Instagram page!
A rare barrel wave turns me over and I plough underwater like a bobsled. It’s quiet — there’s sunlight, fish and the calm of eternity — till I cut my elbow on some coral before crash landing on the shore.

Miles of heaven above, nearly equal depths of ocean below. In between, little specks of humanity bobbing on our fancy boats pretending we know what we do.
Well, they are — the dapper, savvy, internationally competitive sailors at Royal Madras Yatch Club. I am pretending nothing, but clinging on for life, hoping the dolphins will forgive me if I hurl my stomach’s contents into their living room.
I’m sorry, dolphins. I’m trying, but this vessel is almost perpendicular to the water now, and I see more ocean less boat below my feet. I wonder wildly how deep the water is, how many women like me can be stacked on top of each other from the bed to the suface. A hundred? A thousand? I’m too small for this, too inept. I’m too young to die.
Oh look, the boat is straight again: I can rest my feet, lean against the railing for half a minute. “It’s impressive that you haven’t gotten sea sick yet, being a first-timer,” someone tells me. I beam — of course, I’m a natural. I’m queen of the ocean. Oh no, they’re titling the boat again, everyone is darting to the other edge for balance. Somebody save me. 
It is to the sailing team’s credit that no one has laughed at my sheer terror. That they are actually taking the time out to reassure and explain, in the midst of furling and unfurling sails, following commands, calculating wind speed and direction and keeping the slick afloat as it twists and turns impossibly. But then, this community in Chennai is a tight-knit and friendly one; maybe they remember their first time, too (the cool sea spray and leaping dolphins help).
The sailors deal with their tasks and my blunderings for an hour, and then it’s finally time to head back. “Did you have a good time,” they ask? “Oh, yes,” I say. “Would you like to do this again?” 
Sure, a good rush of adrenaline never hurt anyone.

You could watch Karthik Ramasubramanian sing a moving rendition of ‘Ka Karun Sajani’, Krishnaswamy Swamy play the violin with his children, JA Jayanth with the flute, and Rakesh Raghunathan, along with his amma, share a recipe for rayil kathrikai, among other dance and storytelling performances. These are all up on Anil’s Facebook page.







“We have established, celebrity performers, as well as people I was watching perform for the first time. Other than Art, what endeavour brings together 151 people from 18 countries together in just 36 hours?” he says, adding that the hashtag caught on in the US, Canada, Qatar, France, Germany, Singapore and South Africa, among other places.
Meanwhile, since this weekend, the city’s Carnatic community has been taking to Instagram to play the country’s favourite age-old picnic game: Antakshari, online. Vishwanath Ganesh gave the game a Classical twist, with ‘Diwakara Thanujam’. 
He nominated his fellow Carnatic musicians to keep the antakshari going. Soon enough, the trend went viral, with over 100 singers now and still counting, posting snippets of them singing songs with their cats, dogs, children and sundry. 
Thereon, the Carnatic #coronAntakshari moved beyond the traditional style — where you sing a song that starts from the syllable the previous person has ended on — to incorporate different challenges.
“We had certain types of ragas, or swaraksharams, where songs whose starting syllable matches the note on which it starts (sa, ri, ga, ma...); the Chittaiswaram challenge; the Pallavi challenge; or singing as many songs in the same ragam as possible, and so on,” says Vikram Raghavan, who also took part in the antakshari early on. 
Not just vocalists, but also percussionists such as Chandrasekara Sharma on the ghatam, jumped in with their own challenges of beats and konnakol. “I had no idea it would go this viral in this tumultuous period,” says Vishwanath.
But then, argues Anil, “People staying together even when alone, and bringing positive reinforcement at a time like this is necessary. If I am sitting with my phone anyway, I’d rather listen to someone sing than read fake news on WhatsApp!”
With the overwhelming response his project has received, Anil is considering holding the online festival intermittently as we head into the lockdown.

Chennai-based app Alserv provides doorstep services for the elderly,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennai-based-app-alserv-provides-doorstep-services-for-the-elderly/article31143415.ece,"Retirement homes — service apartments that make day-to-day living easier for communities of senior citizens living together — are slowly coming into prominence.
While these living spaces capture the country’s imagination, it made Saravanan Adiseshan and Jagadish Ramamoorthy wonder about its accessibility for everyone. “There is a huge gap in the senior citizen living space today in terms of real estate available and demand,” says Jagadish. The duo claims that its research suggests most retirement homes in gated communities cost above ₹30 lakh, and involves dislocating people from their roots and forcing a major change in their lifestyle. “Most of these homes are situated outside the city. What about those who don’t want to move to a retirement community but still need daily assistance?” he asks.
The duo co-founded Alserv, an app that brings medicare, food and catering, security, home maintenance, and concierge to your doorstep, as an answer. One can choose to employ any of these services depending on the need. “We want to unify senior assistance on a single platform. Through the app, we are connecting people with vendors across the city who provide these services. After subscribing, it is flexible; you can pay as you go according to the service you require,” adds Jagadish.
Alserv also has a dedicated call centre service since not everyone aged 60 and above would be comfortable using an app. “Everyone who uses the app will get their own relationship manager whom they can call whenever they face any issue. If they feel stuck somewhere while navigating the app, they can always call and get help. So comfort factor and rapport is built in,” he says. 














A demo login into the app shows five categories of service, each with its own sub categories. The ‘Medical’ category, for example, would take you to nursing, caretaker, check-up, emergency on-call, and a doctor to speak to via call. The services can be one time or hired in packages. A blinking red emergency option leads us to an emergency number (108) or voice support. While the user experience is seamless, some may find the font too small for comfort. The notifications page gives you the status of your bookings. “We give you the details of the person in charge of the booking along with their photo, so that you don’t worry about who will be coming to your house,” says Jagadish.
The company started a couple of months ago in Chennai, and wants to establish in the city before expanding. With the lockdown situation in light of Coronavirus, Jagadish adds that they are entering uncharted territory. “On the one hand, people will use these services only when they need them. And when they do need it, it is better they get it at home than stepping out and facing more risk,” he says, adding that all their helpers have been trained in safety and hygiene. “Initially, the most popular service was healthcare, but now [demand for] deep cleaning services has gone up. Nobody is currently looking for a caretaker to stay in the house, however, physiotherapists are still in demand.”
When things settle down, the app’s primary aim is to provide peace of mind “for senior citizens as well as their children” living away or abroad. “Their children can look at the app, and be in the loop. They no longer have to ask favours from neighbours, and can live their daily life independently,” he adds.
Alserv is available to download on Google Play and App Store.",society
Social distancing is an idea whose time has finally come,https://www.thehindu.com/society/social-distancing-is-an-idea-whose-time-has-finally-come/article31142222.ece,"Since time immemorial, human beings have been trying to come closer. This is a natural consequence of the process by which we are born. We are yanked out of the womb by strangers, naked and quivering, and spend the rest of our lives trying to rediscover the comfort in which we were born.
Since climbing back in is something most mothers would object to, we seek solace in the arms of others. We want to be close to them. We want to feel their flesh against our flesh. We try to fit on the same seat in the bus, and overload auto rickshaws to unprecedented levels.
Worldwide, our leaders have always shown the way, even the most unexpected ones. Napoleon used to kiss his soldiers on both cheeks, lavishly and often. According to contemporary reports, his lips were wet and clammy. It was one of the contributing factors to the rapid collapse of his empire.
You may argue that this was just a personal quirk, and not representative of a wider trend in history, but this is not true. Hitler was extremely affectionate. Nehru used to leap into crowds at the drop of a hat. Even in cold and inhuman regimes such as the former Soviet Union, such methods were in widespread use. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev would greet all world leaders, without exception, with a kiss on each cheek, followed by a long, lingering smack on the lips. My extensive study of photographs from the time does not indicate any use of tongue.
Many have criticised our PM for hugging world leaders. Before they are dragged off kicking and screaming, for plotting to undermine the Government, they should consider the fact that what used to happen before him was much worse. Brezhnev was particularly fond of East German leader Erich Honecker. If you Google ‘Brezhnev-Honecker kiss’ you will see pictures of the two of them that you will never be able to unsee. YouTube videos of former US President Jimmy Carter trying to avoid the inevitable are also richly entertaining.
Powerful forces like this have conspired over the years to drive us closer together. The problem is particularly acute in India, where population, religion and public transport have led us to the conclusion that personal space is a Western conspiracy. Our need to mingle is deeply ingrained in our psyche. Those who think that now is a good time to criticise religious festivals should consider this before speaking up.
Only a powerful shock to the system can cure us. We have just received that shock. Social distancing is the answer. Let’s hope that the virus goes away soon, with a minimal loss of life. But the habits we acquire should remain. Not just now, but for the foreseeable future, let’s not try to squeeze in between those two little old ladies sitting on the bus. It’s better to keep standing.

IRDAI asks life insurers to enhance grace period for payment of renewal premium ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-asks-life-insurers-to-enhance-grace-period-for-payment-of-renewal-premium/article31145783.ece,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has asked life insurers to enhance the grace period, for their customers, to pay renewal premiums by an additional 30 days in view of the disruption likely from the COVID-19 necessitated lockdown in many States.
“In case of life insurance policies, there is a grace period for payment of renewal premiums. Insurers have been asked to enhance the grace period by additional 30 days if desired by the policyholders. In case of health insurance policies, the insurers may condone delay in renewal up to 30 days without deeming such condonation as a break in policy,” the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said.
Insurers, however, are requested to contact policyholders well in advance so as not to have a discontinuance in coverage, the regulator said permitting certain relaxations. 
In another relaxation, IRDAI said insurers can hold board meetings, due till June 30, through video-conferencing or other audio-visual means. With regard to submission of monthly returns for March 2020 by insurers and insurance intermediaries, the regulator said an additional time of 15 days will be allowed. Similarly, in case of quarterly returns, an additional period up to one month will be permitted.
Appealing to all insurers, insurance intermediaries and distribution channels to be sensitive to the needs of the policyholders in these trying times, IRDAI said it also appealed to all the policyholders to cooperate. The Authority said all insurers had been asked to maintain continuity of business operations through possible alternate modes, including telephonic and digital contact. They have been asked to display on their websites information on functioning of their offices and the alternate arrangements made for premium payments, renewal, settlement of claims and lodging of other service requests.
Separately, in a circular to the insurers, IRDAI Member (Life) K.Ganesh said the grace period for payment of premiums will be extended by one month in the areas where lockdown has been declared by State government.
On claim payment, the circular said any claim received may be settled expeditiously. Urging life insurers to consider developing quicker claim settlement process, IRDAI said the companies should provide information on their respective websites about admissibility or otherwise of COVID-19 death claims, for all products under the contracts already issued.
Specific information, product wise, related to any health insurance contracts already issued, regarding admissibility or otherwise of COVID-19 claims has to be provided in the website, the circular said. ",business
Centre amends law to enable excise duty increase on fuel ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-amends-law-to-enable-excise-duty-increase-on-fuel/article31145780.ece,"The government on Monday amended the law to get enabling powers to raise excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹8 per litre each in future.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved an amendment to the Finance Bill, 2020, to raise the limit up to which the government can raise special excise duty on petrol and diesel to ₹18 per litre and ₹12, respectively.
The amendment, along with the Finance Bill, was passed without a debate in the Lok Sabha.
The government had on March 14 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹3 per litre each to raise an additional ₹39,000 crore in revenue annually. This duty hike included ₹2 a litre increase in special additional excise duty and ₹1 in road and infrastructure cess.
This hike took the special additional excise duty to maximum permissible in law — ₹10 in case of petrol and ₹4 in case of diesel.
Now, through an amendment of the Eighth Schedule of the Finance Act, this limit has been increased to ₹18 per litre in case of petrol and ₹12 in case of diesel.
This is an enabling provision and no change in excise duty is being done as of now, an official said.
The amendment gives powers to the government to raise the duty by up to ₹8 per litre in petrol and diesel at any time it wishes. 
Earlier in the day, the Lok Sabha passed the Finance Bill, 2020, without any discussion as the House curtailed its sittings in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.
More than 40 amendments were introduced by the government to the Finance Bill, which was moved for consideration and passing, by the Finance Minister.
The decision to pass the Bill without any discussion was taken at an all-party meeting convened by Speaker Om Birla. Some amendments moved by the Opposition were negated. The Bill gives effect to the financial proposals of the Central Government for fiscal 2020-21.",business
IDFC First Bank CEO sells ₹93 crore worth shares,https://www.thehindu.com/business/idfc-first-bank-ceo-sells-93-crore-worth-shares/article31145339.ece,"IDFC First Bank MD & CEO V Vaidyanthan has sold shares worth ₹58 crore on March 19 and another ₹35 crore worth shares on March 20 to close an ESOP loan
“I would like to inform that I sold 2,75,58,412 shares yesterday to close the ESOP loan availed by me to acquire the shares and I intend to sell about ₹35 crore worth of stocks today (March 20) to entirely repay the residual ESOP loan taken for exercising my ESOP shares and to release the pledged shares. I would like to clarify that I still hold 4,23,47,144 shares (0.88%) after yesterday’s sale,” Mr. Vaidyanathan informed the bank’s compliance officer. The statement was shared by the bank with exchanges on Friday. “The prices of the stock have come down recently due to the COVID-19-related developments in stock markets across all sectors, including all banks which resulted in a margin call, and at this stage, I decided to sell the stock to entirely square off the ESOP loans. With the sale of ₹35 crore expected today, my loans against shares will be NIL,” he said. “I have no other loans other than a home loan,” he said in the communication which was shared with the exchanges on Friday.
 He also added that the bank is building a strong trajectory of growth of branches, strong growth in retail loans, sharp improvement in CASA, with low NPA and high capital adequacy. 
“All our trajectory is strongly positive across all parameters. Hence, I deeply regret sale of shares at this growth stage of our bank given the wonderful prospects, but I had to do the same to square the ESOP loan. I believe there will be no need for me to sell any more shares in the foreseeable future,” he added. ",business
Coronavirus set to ground all planes,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-set-to-ground-all-planes/article31145333.ece,"The unprecedented action taken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to suspend all domestic flight operations from midnight Tuesday to combat COVID-19 will ground the entire fleet of Indian airlines estimated at 650 aircraft. 
While most part of this fleet has already been grounded since Sunday night when all international operations were shut down, the suspension of domestic operations from 23.59 hrs of Tuesday will bring commercial aviation in India to a grinding halt. Foreign airlines have been banned from flying into India since Sunday. Possibly, this is the first time the aircraft will be grounded for several days, possibly weeks.
 This has been necessitated in the interest of public health and after repeated appeal from States to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the country, said experts.
“To my knowledge, this will be the first time that the whole commercial aviation will come to a stand still. Around three decades back, when Indian Airlines pilots went on strike, the entire domestic fleet was grounded because Indian Airlines was the only domestic airline then. However, international airlines were operating,” said Jitender Bhargava, former executive director, Air India. “This is unprecedented but essential,” he said.
Kapil Kaul, CEO and director, CAPA Advisory, said “The government clearly sees heightened risks related to the COVID-19 virus and is determined to take unprecedented action to slow its transmission. This is the right decision in the prevailing circumstances.”
“For airlines, this suspension coincides with what can only be described as a destruction of demand in the last few days. The timing of the resumption of services is entirely in the control of the government, but it will most likely be beyond 31 March,2020,” he said.
He said the severity of disruption which the Indian aviation industry is experiencing will have an impact that will be felt well beyond FY2021, unless the government is able to provide quick and meaningful support. 
“Industry stability in the post-COVID period will also depend upon promoters of distressed airlines themselves bringing in significant funds,” he said.
According to Mr. Bhargava, the airlines would emerge stronger if they use this opportunity to think of long-term viability and sustainable operations.
“The government should help airlines to defer the payment to airport operators, oil commpanies to help them to deal with this situation. However, the airlines must pay the TDS of employees and their Provident Fund,” he said. ",business

Stem cells may give a respite to COVID-19 infected ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/stem-cells-may-give-a-respite-to-covid-19-infected/article31145282.ece,"While stem cell treatment is not a technique to eradicate or fix coronavirus completely, there is proof to help the idea that infected patients, under the treatment, might be more receptive to survive the disease.
That's because, stem cells oppose viral infection due to the presence of specific qualities known as interferon gamma invigorated qualities (ISGs). These are present in stem cells before their separation process happens. Thus, stem cells can be expected to survive even if they are transferred into a patient with confirmed infection of coronavirus, as per Vipul Jain, CEO, Advancells, a research firm focusing on therapeutic applications of regenerative medicine.
Mr Jain said, “Even medical science has determined how influenza virus A/H5N1, with a history of causing intense lung injury, was destroyed by human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in a mouse. Going back to basics has only expanded the chances of positive outcome.''
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are those stem cells which can separate into an assortment of cell types. There are several other properties of MSCs which make them suitable for clinical trials, such as they have ability to reduce inflammation thus regulating the immune system back to healthy and an extraordinary capacity to find the damaged tissues in human body. They can even speed up the recovery of those damaged tissues.
For instance, to achieve desired outcome, specialists have used enormous quantities of MSCs with one patient in Baoshan (Yunnan) who got 3 implantations of 50 million umbilical blood cord derived MSCs, while every Beijing patients got 1 mixture of 1 million cells for every kilogram of weight.
According to Advancells observations, MSCs can be acquired from fat, which implies that everybody can use his/her cells, abolishing any contamination or fatalities. In any case, extending them to the amount required for implantation, takes 2 to 3 weeks which is why it is valuable to cryo-conserve (process of preserving cells prone to damage) an individual reservoir of MSCs, that would permit to get to an early and progressively beneficial treatment.
It may be noted that, some 14 trials have been conducted using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in China. They recommended stem cells may be the option to fix the extreme organ damage brought about by the virus.
“MSCs can lessen the overproduction of immunity cells caused as a response to the virus and lower down the levels of inflammatory substances. Thus, bringing the weak framework and the whole body back to its ordinary state,'' Mr. Jain said.
What can be securely said at this stage following this spearheading study, as per Advancells, is that MSCs demonstrate extraordinary potential to turn into an important part of eradicating something so huge coronavirus itself.
Commenting on India scenario, he further said, “Sadly, India is slow in terms of awareness, also it is tough to convince ICMR with innovative ideas. China had used it and all patients who have gone for stem cell therapy were recovered. Israel just announced they would start a stem cell pilot for treating coronavirus.”",business
Don’t cut down workforce: PM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dont-cut-down-workforce-pm/article31145266.ece,"Calling COVID-19 an ‘unforeseen hurdle’ for the Indian economy whose impact will be felt for some time to come, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urged India Inc. to not cut down jobs despite the negative impact on business.

Those in attendance included Toyota Kirloskar vice chairman and president of industry body CII Vikram Kirloskar, Kotak Mahindra Bank MD & CEO Uday Kotak, Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran, TVS Motor CMD Venu Srinivasan, founder and co-chairman Jubilant Bhartia Group Hari S. Bhartia, Apollo Hospitals Joint MD and FICCI president Sangeeta Reddy, and HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta.
Mr. Modi added that the challenge posed by the pandemic is graver than even that posed by the World Wars and “we need to be on constant vigil” to prevent its spread. Mr. Kirloskar said CII members would dedicate their plant facilities to help scale up manufacture and availability of essential goods and equipment needed to deal with the medical emergency.
Mr. Kotak said the COVID Rehabilitation Fund would look at the micro and small industry, which would need special handholding and help to rehabilitate their business.
All Indian citizens should be given cash in their accounts through the direct benefit transfer, CII said; while those below 25 years could be given a one-time payment of ₹5,000, senior citizens above 65 can be given ₹10,000, it said.
 CII also said there was an immediate need to enable advances for ways and means for industry across sectors and the government could perhaps explore a moratorium on interest and principal for the next three months. “It may also be important to suspend IBC proceedings while redefining norms for NPAs, as several companies will be unable to meet payment obligations.”

“Amidst the fear of the virus, the indigenous gem and jewellery sector in the country has come to a standstill with virtually no footfalls in jewellery stores. Many jewellers have to even shut down their shops located in malls and shopping complexes,”’he said.

GJC urges government officials and banking sector officials to consider the issues faced by the gems and jewellery sector, which is one of the top three job creators and employers in the country,” he said.
GJC has urged the government to give further extension of at least 180 days for repayment under the Gold Metal Loan (GML) scheme and interest thereon.

As a one-time relief, GJC has urged the government to extend the due date for the payment of advance tax by at least 180 days. 
GJC has also urged the government for deferring the GST return and extending the time limit for filing GST return. It has also sought to reduce the customs duty to 4%.",business

"‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’, ‘The Insult’ and the ideals of masculinity",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ayyappanum-koshiyum-the-insult-and-the-ideals-of-masculinity/article31142902.ece,"Self-isolation is a blessing in disguise. For, it allows you to watch/revisit movies that you otherwise may have missed on the screen — like how I ended up watching Ayyappanum Koshiyum on Amazon Prime recently. What was captivating, for me, was the ostensible commentary on masculinity that runs throughout the movie.
A fascinating stretch in Ayyappanum Koshiyum comes in the form of a verbal confrontation between Koshi (a terrific Prithviraj Sukumaran) and his father Kurien (Ranjith), both of whom are bound by their patriarchal values but are at loggerheads when questions related to manhood arise. It is a critical scene that examines how Koshi is perceived in the eyes of his father: a teenage boy with testosterone issues. You see desperation in Koshi’s eyes in trying to prove that he is no less than a ‘man’, with the underlying emotion driven by hate. In another movie, Koshi would have definitely slapped Kurien in that scene — if you are thinking about Vada Chennai, which had a similar set-up, you are not alone. “This is between Ayyappanum Koshiyum. Don’t involve women and children in this. Otherwise, this will end only with the death of either one of us.” Koshi issues a warning to Kurien, who receives the message with a casual: “That’s how the lives of men are, you spineless fellow.” This entire stretch, if I can say, is the spine of Ayyappanum Koshiyum, resulting in a tug of war on who is the ‘ideal’ man and showing the murky sides of malevolence.
In the same scene, Koshi realises the noticeable absence of women and asks this to his father: “What about the lives of women? If one of us dies, then one would either end up being the wife of a murderer or a widow.” His wife Ruby (Anna Rajan) intervenes at this juncture and admonishes Kurien for triggering Koshi to indulge in a warfare with Ayyappan Nair (Biju Menon, in a phenomenal performance). The scene ends with Ruby getting a tight slap from Koshi for crossing the borderline, when it is a matter concerning men. Koshi, if you think about it, basically counters his own argument on the participation of women in the larger scheme of things. But that is true of a patriarch, right? This entire stretch and the resultant conversations are fascinating. Because Ayyappanum Koshiyum (written and directed by Sachy) makes an interesting analogy on what constitutes a real ‘man’ in the first place and demonstrates the malaise of male pride. The aforementioned sequence, in particular, shows the zenith of manhood, with women being a mere bystander to the proceedings reserved for and by men.
By now, you must be aware that masculinity is a social construct and that men would go to the cosmic extent in defending their masculine status, any day. I came across an interesting quote by Thomas Hobbes while watching a video shared by a friend. He wrote, “When men live without fear of a common power, they live in a state of warre. In warre, every man is against every other man.” Hobbes’ quote is a perfect description of the world inhabited by the characters of Ayyappanum Koshiyum, despite having a common power: law and order — unlike say, a Colosseum where gladiators’ valour and strength were put to test. They are a little more than macho men and a little less than beasts. In an article in The Hindu, Rajeev Bhargava presents a superb argument on manhood. He says, “Manhood is not naturally given, but is a goal to be achieved. To be born a boy is a privilege, but one that can be lost if one is not properly initiated into masculine practices. Besides, male adults must maintain this privilege by regular performance.”
The central characters, Ayyappan and Koshi, are in a constant state of fear of being tested for their masculinity, especially when their egos get bruised. As Bhargava argues, they need to maintain the privilege by regular performance. The word ‘performance’ here translates to indulging in mindless acts, in an effort to take superiority over the other. They never cease to exercise their male privilege and arrogance that come with it. To put it lightly, they are masculine beasts that need to be tamed — only by one another. “If this situation persists, they would kill each other,” says a police officer. Ayyappan and Koshi might hide under the blanket of stout-hearted men but deep down, they are very insecure about the pride associated with their gender. This insecurity is what Sachy seemed to have tapped into Ayyappanum Koshiyum. 
Koshi Kurien’s ego gets pricked when he is given two slaps by Ayyappan Nair, when he is found to have possessed hard liquor, in an alcohol-free zone. His ego stems from the fact that a) he is an ex-army man and b) he has been hit by a sub-inspector, someone who is in the lower order of power structure. Ayyappan’s ego is pricked because a) he was only following protocols and b) he stands powerless in front of a man of a privileged background. This small incident sets off a bomb of events of mammoth proportions and of cascading effects. What starts as a conflict between two men turns into an ugly fight between the haves and have-nots. Therefore, their personal issue becomes slightly political.
“Ayyappanum Koshiyum is basically an extended ego match built on crude reality, yet very mainstream and compelling,” says The Hindu’s review. The way Sachy has built his script, riding primarily on the ego factor reminded me of another great movie I watched at the Chennai International Film Festival in 2018. It is the Lebanese movie The Insult, also involving two characters who suffer from a common disease of male arrogance. Both Ayyappanum Koshiyum and The Insult follow a similar narrative arc. Two men quarrel on something trivial and something that could have been resolved with a “sorry”, that acts as a point of escalation for the characters. But unlike Ayyappanum Koshiyum, which has sparks flying each time the two men enter the frame, The Insult was a more subtle and deeply political courtroom drama.
The Insult centres on the dispute between Tony Hanna (Adel Karam), a Lebanese Christian and Yasser Abdallah Salameh (Kamel El Basha), a Palestine refugee and a construction worker. Yasser, who works near Tony’s place, notices an illegal construction of a water pipe and offers to fix it. Condescending looks and expletives are exchanged. Yasser is brought to Tony’s garage to apologise for calling him a “f***ing prick”. When the former tries to walk past Tony, he says, “I wish Ariel Sharon had wiped you all out.” Yasser throws a punch in his gut, breaking a rib or two. Tony drags Yasser to the court and soon, the issue snowballs into a greater political war between Lebanese and Palestine. 
Towards the end of The Insult, there is a heart-rending moment between the two characters. Yasser visits Tony on the night before the judgement and says, “We all know who you [Lebanese Christians] guys are. You are a bunch of cry babies.” Unable to suppress the anger, Tony lands a punch on Yasser like the way latter did. The camera cuts to a close-up of Tony’s trembling hands. Yasser, on the other hand, gets back on his feet and says, “I am sorry” and walks away. I do not remember how the festival audience reacted to The Insult, but I certainly know that this scene got the loudest cheer.
It is a testament to show the pointlessness of wearing one’s masculinity up his sleeves. We are not sure if Ayyappan and Koshi have changed for the better. But if one were to take a leaf out of The Insult, it is this: the greatest form of resilience is the quality to step back, apologise and move ahead.",movies
Amitabh Bachchan deletes post on ‘clapping vibrations destroy virus potency’ after being called out,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/amitabh-bachchan-deletes-post-on-clapping-vibrations-destroy-virus-potency-after-being-called-out/article31142809.ece,"Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan on Monday was heavily criticised for one of his tweets, which claimed vibrations from clapping, blowing conch shells as part of Sunday’s Janata Curfew would have reduced or destroyed coronavirus potency as it was ‘amavasya’, the darkest day of the month.
 Bachchan’s tweet comes in the wake of several similar fake news stories misinterpreting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal of clapping and clanging plates to express gratitude to those providing essential services during this global health crisis.
 The 77-year-old actor took to Twitter and, in a tweet that has now been deleted, wrote, “An opinion given: 5 PM, 22nd Mar, ‘amavasya’, darkest day of month; virus, bacteria evil force at max potential & power! Clapping shankh vibrations reduce/ destroy virus potency Moon passing to new ‘nakshatra’ Revati. Cumulative vibration betters blood circulation.” 
Bachchan posted the tweet along with his picture, which had three question marks scribbled on it, leading many to wonder if the actor was sharing his opinion or questioning the theory floating on social media.
 However, his tweet was met with criticism as netizens slammed him for tweeting something which was not factual. 
Lyricist Varun Grover was among the first ones to slam Bachchan, writing that the actor should’ve been more responsible at a time like this. “Shameful superstitions propaganda coming from a person with such huge reach. And we have learned to let go of ‘besharmi’ (shamelessness) of many of our celebs but this is DANGEROUS too. Indian lives are at stake here and you need to be more responsible,” Grover tweeted. 
Bachchan is one of the most active and followed celebrities on social media. His followers count on Twitter alone stands at a staggering 40.5 million. 
Bachchan’s tweet was also slammed by many journalists, lawyers and activists, who asked people to “mass report the tweet” so that’s it’s taken down by the microblogging site for spreading misinformation.
 Recently, Twitter removed a video uploaded by actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth who claimed the 14-hour window of total social distancing as advised by the PM was necessary to curb the spread of virus. 
The video was reportedly pulled down as it violated Twitter’s rules on misinformation. 
According to the Union Health Ministry, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country rose to 415 on Monday. Seven people had died till Saturday evening due to the virus. ",movies

"Paws, claws and jaws: The best creature features to get you through the coronavirus pandemic ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/paws-claws-and-jaws-the-best-creature-features-to-get-you-through-the-coronavirus-pandemic/article31141792.ece,"Working from home means shaving off considerable commute time, which means you have more time to read, write letters, do some gardening, yoga or vegetate in front of a screen — had to give the healthy options first. In the digital ocean of content, you could either scare yourself silly watching Steven Soderbergh’s excellent Contagion (2009) — cheap thrills in terms of seeing the inside of Gwyneth Paltrow’s goopy head notwithstanding — the extremely well put together Malayalam film, Virus (2019), Netflix’s hideously prescient documentary series Pandemic, or you could go for some good old fashioned escapism in the form of creature features.
The fun thing about these films is the threat is always nullified at the end of the film. There is a way to counter the threat. No matter how big the snake or how many sharp teeth the shark has, there will always be a Chief Brody to kill it with an oxygen tank. Though strictly speaking, the Alien movies can be classified as creature features in space, Jurassic Park is about, well dinosaurs running amok in a theme park and Godzilla is a giant radioactive lizard, they come under sci-fi, and would be better served in a different list. 
Meanwhile, The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) features Michael Douglas going after the man-eaters of Tsavo, lions that killed numerous workers laying the Uganda-Mombasa Railway line in 1898. It doesn’t feature on this list as it is more adventure and the lions were being sensible protecting their habitat. Douglas comes across as rather silly with culturally appropriated dances and what not. 
So here goes a list of the happiest clash of paws, claws and jaws.
Jaws (1975)







Okay this is the big daddy of all creature features. The beach party, the girl going skinny dipping, John Williams’ ominous score, the shark-eye cam, the flash of a wicked tail fin, the dead eyes and the cruel teeth all contributed to laying the template for the summer blockbuster. Based on Peter Benchley’s eponymous novel, Jaws starred Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody who with oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) — there will always be an Ahab, go hunting for the man-eating great white. The suggestion of the shark rather than the whole shark, was due to the many mechanical failures of the shark model, but it worked exceedingly well to build the tension. What the mind imagines is usually worse than reality. Oh and incidentally the film was directed by Steven Spielberg.
Anaconda (1997)







Where does one start with this movie directed by Luis Llosa? Is it Jennifer Lopez as serious documentary filmmaker before she became JLo? Or the big, fat anaconda slithering here and there and performing feats of preternatural skill that could drive herpetologists into frothing fits of fury? There is also Jon Voight chewing up the scenery as the Ahab style hunter. He gets his just desserts when the anaconda gobbles him up and then throws up — obviously could not digest his bad acting. The movie spawned a series and crossover, but nothing matches the joy of the first movie.
Lake Placid (1999)







This movie about a giant crocodile terrorising the good people of Black Lake in Maine is a must watch for the dear old lady who feeds the grinning crocodile with sundry cows and her husband. Oliver Platt as mythology professor Hector Cyr is fun while Bridget Fonda shows off her tanned legs as a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History. Brendan Gleeson before he was the tenacious Bill Hodges (Mr Mercedes) plays the thankless role of the Sheriff Hank Keough, while Bill Pullman is Fish and Game officer Jack Wells. The scene where the crocodile jumps out of the lake to eat the bear is delicious eye candy.
Deep Blue Sea (1999)







Samuel L Jackson being eaten mid-sentence is the highlight of this film about genetically engineered mako sharks. It seems like something Dr Evil would think up given his fondness for sharks with lasers attached to their heads so they can have a hot meal. Directed by Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger! Die Hard 2!) the film stars Saffron Burrows as the scientist and rapper LL Cool J as the chef with the coolest lines. He also contributed two songs—‘Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)’ and ‘Say What’.
Piranha 3D (2010)







This irreverent take on monster movies is as grisly as it is funny. The prehistoric piranha, which swim out of a crevice after an earthquake have big goo-goo eyes and shiny serrated teeth and attack everyone from seismologists to pornographers and wet t-shirt contestants. Directed by Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes), the film stars the lovely Elisabeth Shue as cop Julie Forester, Ving Rhames as her deputy and Steven R. McQueen (grandson of king of cool, Steve McQueen) as her son, Jake.
Richard Dreyfuss, the shark expert from Jaws is the first victim of the piranha attack even as he sings ‘Show me the way to go home’, which if you remember is what he sang on the way back from killing the shark in Jaws. That is how knowing the film is! Added bonus is Christopher Lloyd (Doc from The Back to the Future movies) as retired marine biologist Carl Goodman who identifies the piranha.",movies
Netflix’s Ted Sarandos: ‘People are watching more content amid coronavirus pandemic’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflixs-ted-sarandos-people-are-watching-more-content-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/article31141446.ece,"With many cities worldwide under lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos has said the company has witnessed a surge in online viewership.
 Sarandos told Brian Stelter on CNN’s ‘Reliable Sources’ that the novel coronavirus has caused a “massive disruption” in the global entertainment industry.
“It’s been a massive disruption. Every of one of our productions around the world are shut down. It’s unprecedented in history,” the executive said.
 When asked about viewing, Sarandos said, “You can imagine, all viewing is up. It’s up on Netflix, on CNN on television in general. The system has been very robust and can help out a lot of people. People certainly are watching a lot more Netflix.” 
As for the content, he said the streamer currently has a good library of shows that can easily serve the subscribers for the next few months.
“What’s happening now is we work pretty far ahead with delivering all the episodes of our shows at once so no disruption over the next few months, maybe later in the year as physical production is not operational,” he added.
 Though many productions have halted work, Sarandos said they have all gone digital and started implementing the concept of “virtual reading rooms”.
“One of our shows, ‘Big Mouth’, the other day, did their first virtual table read. We had 40 actors and writers with Netflix executives doing a table read of a new episode. So, people are being quite adaptive on getting ready to — on getting geared up for a time when we do get back to work,” he added.",movies

The Ant-Man and the Wasp star’s comments on social distancing didn’t go down well with Turner, who urged her fans to take precautions against the spread of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of over 14,000 people worldwide.
“Stay inside, don’t be f**ing stupid. Even if you count your ‘freedom over ... your health’,” Turner, 24, said during an Instagram live.
“I don’t give a F about your freedom. You could be infecting other people, other vulnerable people around you, by doing this. So stay inside, guys. It’s not cool and it’s not big and it’s not clever. And that’s the tea,” she added.
Last Week, Lilly, 40, shared that she dropped her kids off at a gymnastics camp and that “they all washed their hands before going in”. 
She accompanied the post with the hashtag “business as usual”, which did not go down well with many social media users.
 The actor later wrote in the comments section, “Some people value their lives over freedom, some people value freedom over their lives. We all make our choices. Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law for my comfort already, all in the name of a respiratory flu.” ",movies
Capturing cinematographer Ravi Varman’s journey through a photo series ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ravi-varmans-photo-series/article31140996.ece,"“Just you and your Zenith 6. That’s all we require,” declared Chennai-based photographer L Ramachandran. 
Those golden words were what convinced sought-after cinematographer Ravi Varman to undertake this assignment. Varman was working on the Kamal Haasan-starrer Indian 2 at that time. He later backed out of the project, but the seed Ramachandran sowed stayed with him for long. The concept was simple: to narrate Ravi Varman’s rags-to-riches story, in the form of portraiture.
Those unfamiliar with the cinematographer’s life story might not be aware of how he took to the camera. As a young boy, Varman arrived from Thanjavur to Madras in 1987 with a shirt and a lungi, and an out-of-focus photograph of his mother, who had just passed away. He found work as a waiter at the Amaravathi Hotel — his first salary was ₹150. “I remember going to Moore Market to buy a colourful T-shirt and lungi,” recalls Ravi Varman. On the way, he stopped at a camera shop where he ended up spending his entire salary to buy a Zenith 6. Therein began his tryst with the camera — something that would take him from Kollywood (Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, Anniyan and Dasavathaaram) to Bollywood (Barfi, Tamasha and Sanju).

Cut to February 2020, he fished out his prized possession for the photo series that Ramachandran had elaborately planned. “It’s probably the most valuable thing that I have,” says Varman, as we skim through the black-and-white clicks that feature the cinematographer and his best friend: the camera.

Ramachandran’s love for Varman’s work started from the early stages of the latter’s career. “I loved how he played with colours and his frame sense. I was used to seeing such colours in Hollywood films, but movies like Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela and Barfi had that effect on me.”
Varman’s diaryWorked as cinematographer in multiple big-budget Tamil films like Dasavathaaram, Anniyan and Kaatru Veliyidai.A sought-after cameraman in Bollywood, he is known for his work in Barfi, Sanju and Jagga Jasoos.
But when the two sat down for this shoot, they decided to go with a black and white tone, with props that would bring to life what Varman would have experienced back then. After about 50 clicks, Ramachandran got what he wanted; a series of photographs that had the cinematographer posing like a magician, with a hat, and the Zenith 6 in hand. “We wanted to recreate the setting like how it would have been when he came to Madras.” So, the props they used were suitcases, with ‘cinematic lighting’ filling in the frames. “Usually, such shots have strobe lighting. I avoided that. To shoot a cinematographer in cinematic lighting was a memorable moment.”
SHOOT AT SIGHTRamachandran’s own journey is a chequered one; a self-taught photographer whose creative contours have reportedly made him the only Indian representative photographer of the Playboy magazine. All his recent photo series’ are accompanied by a documentary — of the making of the pictures and a sneak peek into the subject’s personality.At the moment, he has a three-minute cut that would be made public soon, to show audiences the challenges behind setting up a photo shoot of this scale. He has done multiple shoots, both nationally and internationally, but Ramachandran is still reticent before every session. “Every photo session scares me. That’s probably because I don’t compromise on my lighting pattern.”
There was one particular shot in the series that was completely unplanned — Ravi Varman flexing his muscles. “It happened when he was changing shirts, and someone commented how it was so unique that a cinematographer had such a well-toned body,” recalls Ramachandran, “And then I thought, why not take a picture? After all, his journey did start with a camera without a shirt, right?”",movies

Into The Wild with Rajinikanth, the latest installment in the British adventurer’s many range of survival shows, follows heavily in the footsteps of Grylls’ previous Man vs Wild exploits with Narendra Modi in (“His sense of humour surprised me,” Grylls tells Rajinikanth about the Indian Prime Minister), an image-building exercise devised to highlight the Tamil superstar’s political aspirations, while also catering to his bevy of fans who worship the ‘person’ behind the icon.






Rajinikanth gearing up for the day at Bandipur Tiger Reserve
 






Themed around the idea of water conservation — Rajinikanth has spoken earlier about his erstwhile ‘vision’ to link the rivers across India — the 40-odd minute episode tracks the duo spend a day at the Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka, navigating through a set of seemingly simple tasks, interspersed with some moments of bromance/ candid conversations between the unlikely pairing.
“I wish I could travel on a bus now, the last time I did so was by putting on a disguise in Bangalore,” laughs Rajinikanth, as he gives Grylls a crash course into his journey towards becoming a celebrated actor. This, and a few more heartfelt revelations keep the episode from becoming too much of an extended fan vehicle: though he does get a proper movie-style intro, complete with pulsating background score and the ‘Super Star Rajni’ animation.







Onto to the actual adventures then: cross a rusty bridge that has a 50-ft drop with just a rope for support and no ‘mattress’ underneath; trek down a ravine to gather water from a stream that will be sent to a lab for pollutant-testing; and finally, retrieve a camera that has been taping animals for three days by wading across a water body that could potentially house a croc (naaah, of course it doesn’t)
Rajinikanth and Grylls’ repartee make for decent camaraderie — even if a lot of the former’s answers are mostly in Tamil to an enthusiastically-nodding Grylls — and even the most begrudging of watchers will find some novelty to watching a man whose larger-than-life on-screen persona always take precedence, delve into his personal life, albeit fleetingly.
“My whole life is a miracle to me,” he says, while Grylls marvels at his energy levels, tempting us to do so as well.
Kamal Haasan, Madhavan and Akshay Kumar make guest appearances to wish their ‘friend’ luck, Rajinikanth changes a flat tyre for the first time in his life, teaches Grylls how to do his signature flick with the sunglasses, and even lets us in on his favourite quote in life: “This too shall pass.”






Rajinikanth and Grylls share a surprisingly effective camaraderie  






Towards the end of the episode, the actor-politician says that his hope for the country is to remove poverty and unemployment, and India shouldn’t be just culturally rich, but economically too. “Our greatest virtue is that four religions —Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism and Islam — are all accepted in here and we live as brothers. I’m proudest of that,” he beams to Grylls.
Ultimately, the collaboration does succeed in its intention to present a hitherto unseen side of Rajinikanth, one that he shall seek to endear more to the public, as his political aspirations take centre-stage in the coming months.
Favourite moment: Bear Grylls telling Rajini that he wished he had the latter’s looks, and the Annaatthe star bemusedly responding, “Really, my looks?! You’re better-looking than me, Bear!”

"Rupee hits a fresh low, breaches 76 per dollar",https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/rupee-hits-a-fresh-low-breaches-76-per-dollar/article31145231.ece,"The rupee hit a fresh low on Monday, breaching the 76-to-a-dollar mark, amid the spread of COVID-19 across the country that has prompted several States to call for a shut down.
The rupee opened weaker at 75.69 against the dollar, compared with its previous close of 75.20. The rupee hit the day’s low of 76.33 before closing the day at 76.20 a dollar, down 100 paisa, or 1.33%, from its previous close.
“The pandemic is causing widespread lockdowns, causing the economy to grind to a halt. In such a situation, emerging market currencies are vulnerable due to their dependence on dollar debt. A scramble for dollars would continue as long as the panic lasts,” Anindya Banerjee, DVP, Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives at Kotak Securities, said. 
Mr. Banerjee said the RBI would continue to sell dollars aggressively, but that may not stop bleeding by the rupee, which could head to 78-a-dollar levels. 
“Over the next couple of weeks, there is growing risk of USD-INR inching towards 78 levels on spot. Technically, USD-INR needs to respect the 74.50 level, the previous all-time high, to keep the bullish bias alive,” he said. ",markets

 Forex traders said market participants are concerned that the sharp rise in coronavirus cases, which has crossed over 400 in the country, could weigh on the economy.
 The rupee which opened on a weak note at 75.90 at the interbank forex market, finally settled at 76.22 against the US dollar, registering a decline of over 102 paise over its last close.

 The local unit had settled at 75.20 against the US dollar on Friday.
 COVID-19 cases in India has increased to 415, according to the Union Health Ministry.
 “The currency has been weighed down in the last few sessions also due to broad strength in the dollar against its major crosses.

Fish fossil show how fins evolved into human hands ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fish-fossil-show-how-fins-evolved-into-human-hands/article31139805.ece,"Researchers have revealed new insights into how the human hand evolved from fish fins based on their analysis of an ancient fossil found in Miguasha, Canada. 
Palaeontologists, including those from Flinders University in Australia, said the fish specimen has yielded the missing evolutionary link in the transition from fish to four legged animals. 
 They said this happened during the Late Devonian period, millions of years ago, as fish began to foray in habitats such as shallow water and land. 
 The study, published in the journal Nature, noted that the 1.57 m long fossil shows the complete arm — pectoral fin — skeleton for the first time in any elpistostegalian fish. 
 Using high energy X-Ray CT-scans, the scientists assessed the skeleton of the pectoral fin, revealing the presence of a humerus (arm), radius and ulna (forearm), rows of carpus (wrist) and phalanges organized in digits (fingers).
 “This is the first time that we have unequivocally discovered fingers locked in a fin with fin-rays in any known fish,” said John Long, study co-author from Flinders University professor. “The articulating digits in the fin are like the finger bones found in the hands of most animals,” Mr. Long said. 
The finding, according to the researchers, pushes back the origin of fingers in vertebrates to the fish level. They said it also reveals that the patterning for the vertebrate hand was first developed deep in evolution, just before fishes left the water.
 The evolution of fishes into four-legged vertebrates was one of the most significant events in the history of life, the study noted.
 With this adaptation, the scientists said, vertebrates, or back-boned animals, were then able to leave the water and conquer land. 
 To complete this transition, they said, one of the most significant changes was the evolution of hands and feet. “The origin of digits relates to developing the capability for the fish to support its weight in shallow water or for short trips out on land. The increased number of small bones in the fin allows more planes of flexibility to spread out its weight through the fin,” said study co-author Richard Cloutier from the Universite du Quebec in Canada.

Postponing Olympics an appropriate decision: Sindhu ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postponing-olympics-an-appropriate-decision-sindhu/article31156794.ece,"World badminton champion P.V. Sindhu has welcomed the decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics.
“I think it was the most appropriate decision given the prevailing critical situation. 
“The organisers have shown concern for the the health of every one involved by not going ahead with the original schedule,” Sindhu told The Hindu on Tuesday.
“Athletes should be prepared for unforeseen developments. Now, with the Games officially postponed, naturally we will have to re-plan our preparations. But, first, let us all hope that the situation improves globally,” added Sindhu.
Chief badminton coach P. Gopi Chand also welcomed the decision.
“I welcome this very good decision for it would have been difficult to conduct the Games given the uncertainty shrouding the situation. Athletes would have found it extremely challenging to make it to the Games if they were to be held as per the original schedule in July.
“I don’t know what kind of impact it (the postponement) will have on badminton players, for first we have to know the BWF guidelines and the new qualification norms. Whether they will go ahead with the existing norms or not,” Gopi said.

 Coronavirus | Maxime Mbanda tackling a different opponent now,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-maxime-mbanda-tackling-a-different-opponent-now/article31156724.ece,"Italian international Maxime Mbanda has leapt from the back row on the rugby pitch to the front line in the fight against the coronavirus, becoming a volunteer ambulance driver in Parma, and bears witness to a frightening reality on the pandemic.
Last Saturday, Mbanda was scheduled to face England in front of 60,000 people in Rome for his 21st Italian cap, but that match, like so many others, has been postponed.
Instead, wearing a mask and protective suit, he went out again as an ambulance driver with other volunteers from the Yellow Cross in Parma, in Emilia-Romagna, one of the areas most affected by the coronavirus.
By Saturday, almost 800 more people in Italy had died from the disease, taking the total in the country to 4,825.
“When everything was cancelled in rugby, I wondered how I could help, even without medical expertise,” Mbanda, who plays for Zebre Rugby, the Parma club, said. 
“I found the Yellow Cross, which had a transport service for medicine and food for the elderly.”
After delivering masks, food and prescriptions one day, the physical strength of the 26-year-old forward was put to good use where it was most needed, “on the front line, at the heart of the problem”.
“I found myself transferring positive patients from one local hospital to another. I help with the stretcher or if there are patients to be carried from a wheelchair. I also hold the oxygen,” he explained.
It is a situation of desperate urgency, where, he says, “95% of hospital facilities are dedicated to coronavirus patients”.
“If people see what I see in the hospitals, there wouldn’t be a queue in front of the supermarkets anymore,” he said. “They would think two, three or four times before leaving home, even to go running,” he said.
“What I see are people of all ages, on respirators, on oxygen, doctors and nurses on 20-or-22-hour shifts, not sleeping one minute of the day and just trying to get some rest the next day,” he added.
“I wish I could say that the situation here has reached its limit. But I’m afraid I have to say that's not the case.”
Mbanda has no medical experience, but he is working with the support of his girlfriend and his father, a surgeon in Milan, “also on the front line.”
Mbanda has had to become a psychologist in contact with patients put in wards “where death is the order of the day”.
“When you see the look in their eyes... even if they can’t speak, they communicate with the eyes and they tell you things you can’t imagine,” he said.
“They hear the alarms, the doctors and nurses running from one ward to the next. The first person I collected from the hospital told me that he had been there for three hours when the neighbour in the next bed died. And during the night, two other women died in his room. He had never seen anyone die,” Mbanda narrated.
“I started eight days ago, without a day’s break and with shifts of 12 or 13 hours. But faced with what I see in the infectious disease rooms, I tell myself that I can’t be tired,” he said.
Accustomed, as an Italian international, to tackling stronger opponents, Mbanda said he won’t give up.
“As long as I'm strong, I'll keep going. I'm here and I'm staying here. As long as there's an emergency, I'm here and I'm staying here.” ",other sports

Postponement an athlete’s nightmare,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postponement-an-athletes-nightmare/article31154750.ece,"Rescheduling of a major event is any athlete’'s nightmare, says 1996 Atlanta Olympics hockey goalkeeper Aloysius Edwards. 
Months of planning and preparation go for a toss, Edwards, who represented India in 147 internationals between 1989 and 2000, including the 1994 World Cup, told The Hindu on Tuesday on receiving news of the Tokyo Olympics being postponed.
“The worst-hit will be those who are on the verge of making it to the Olympics, the dream of any athlete,” he says.
“The challenge is of a different nature, too, given that the athlete is at home during a lockdown. If you are forced indoors by injury, you know you can make it back by working on it, but here you are staring at grim possibilities,” he says. 
“There will be some who may miss the bus for the simple reason that there will be fresh guidelines and qualifying standards, especially in individual disciplines. Young contenders who cannot be ignored will emerge.
“With each passing month, it will be difficult to sustain the motivation to keep going as the time-frame has changed,” he feels.
“Most athletes prepare with the specific objective of peaking at the right time for a major event, especially the Olympics. And, the Games not being held as scheduled will be a huge dampener,” he said. 
And, Edwards should know what it means to miss an Olympics! For, after attending the one-month preparatory camp in Brisbane before the 2000 Sydney Olympics and even being presented the official No. 12 jersey (which he exchanged with Jude Felix’s No. 1 on the latter’s request), the Hyderabadi was sent home and Devesh Chauhan preferred.
“There are bound to be many hurdles when the original schedule is changed. A major challenge for athletes, as well as coaches, will be re-drawing the entire training programme,” he says.
“However, postponement was the only sensible option left for the Olympics organisers, given the grim scenario across the world. After all, athletes’ health and safety are of paramount importance,” he concluded.",other sports

The Games were scheduled for July 24-August 9, but after telephone discussions between IOC president Thomas Bach and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a historic joint decision was taken for the first postponement of an Olympics in peacetime.
Abe said Bach was in “100% agreement” when Japan asked the IOC to push back the Games and said the delayed Olympics “held in a complete form will be a testament to mankind’s defeat of the new virus.”
Also read: Coronavirus | Canada withdraws from 2020 Games as Japan, IOC consider postponement
In a joint statement, the pair said that based on current World Health Organization information, the Tokyo Games “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.”
“The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present.
“Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020,” the statement concluded.
Bach later said he did not discuss new dates with Abe and the exact dates is a question for the Tokyo organising committee and an International Olympic Committee panel overseeing the preparations.
The torch relay, due to start on Thursday from the Fukushima, will be postponed and the flame will remain there for now.
The move would be a devastating blow for Tokyo, which had won widespread praise for its organisation, with venues finished well ahead of time and tickets massively oversubscribed.
The Olympics, which has experienced boycotts, terrorist attacks and protests, but has been held every four years since 1948, would be the highest-profile event affected by the virus that has killed thousands and closed sports competitions worldwide.
The IOC has come under increasing pressure in recent days to postpone the Games, scheduled to start on July 24, with 1.7 billion people across the planet in lockdown to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.
Training has become impossible for many athletes and exposes them to the risk of contracting or spreading the disease. Competitions and qualifiers have been scrapped, while international travel is severely limited.
On Sunday, the IOC had initially given itself a deadline of four weeks to come up with a proposal to postpone the Games, a Herculean task that touches on every aspect of Tokyo 2020 planning from venues to security to ticketing.
But after Canada and Australia withdrew their teams and the powerful US Olympic Committee and World Athletics also joined the chorus calling for a postponement, the writing was on the wall for the July start.
Tokyo was spending some $12.6 billion to host the Games, according to its latest budget, and experts believe a postponement could cost it some $6 billion in the short-term before recouping it when it eventually goes ahead.
It will also be a bitter blow to sponsors and major broadcasters who rely on the four-yearly extravaganza for critical advertising revenue.
It is not the first time Tokyo has seen unscheduled changes to the Games — it was due to be the first Asian country to host the Olympics in 1940 before pulling out due to international pressure over its war with China.
But Tokyo 2020 organisers point to the unparalleled complexity — not to mention cost — of shifting the Games. It is not even clear venues will be available and tens of thousands of hotel rooms will need to be cancelled and rebooked.
Squeezing in the 16-day Games into what will already be a hugely crowded 2021 calendar is another major headache, with arguably the two biggest sports, swimming and athletics, due to hold their World Championships that summer.
However, World Athletics has already said it was prepared to shift its World championships, scheduled for August 6-15 next year in Oregon, to accommodate the move.",other sports

‘99 Songs’ movie review: Composer AR Rahman, and not the writer, is who we need more of

Shashwat kickstarts musical proceedings in the hummable ‘Teri Nazar’ that begins with a whiff of Charukesi raga, which takes you back to the magical Rahman that gave us ‘Udhaya Udhaya’ (Udhaya) and ‘Aahista Aahista’ (Swades). There’s longing and pining in the vocals and with the flute as accompaniment, it hits all the right notes.
‘Jwalamukhi’ has been doing the rounds for some time now, and for the right reasons. There are two versions — one with Arijit Singh, who delivers predictably, but the Poorvi Koutish contribution stands out for its vocal texture.
If ‘O Aashiqa’ has a tightly-knit chorus that metamorphoses into a neat melodical line, ‘Sofia’ has an old-fashioned charm before it becomes a beast of its own, with the word ‘Sofia’ repeatedly hitting home musically.
With ‘Nayi Nayi’, Rahman taps into the world that he created so exquisitely with 2011’s hit flick Rockstar. Shashwat Singh’s vocals stand out in this heavy-on-guitars piece that could have well made it into a modern-day Aamir Khan or Shah Rukh Khan film and become a blockbuster song.







Singer Armaan Malik gets a tough challenge in ‘Humnawaa’, an intricately-designed track that needs more than a few listens to get into your head. So does ‘Soja Soja’ (Shashaa Tirupati). The problem with many AR Rahman soundtracks, something well-known with listeners of film music, exists in 99 Songs as well — it requires more than a few listens to get into its soul. But once you devote that time, which you have aplenty now thanks to ‘social distancing’, you’ll be sold.
Bela Shende (the other vocal pick of the album) goes all devotional in ‘Sai Shirdi Sai’, an ‘Oh Paalanhaare’ kind of song that somehow doesn’t fit into the scheme of things here. She more than makes up for it with ‘O Mera Chand’, another throwback melody that’s right up there to match with the in-form Rahman albums of Meenaxi and Taal. ‘Gori Godh Bhari’ brings back vintage Alka Yagnik, but this classically-inclined number, with traces of raga Bageshri, would probably not appeal to the popular musical palate.
Among the stand-out pieces in 99 Songs is ‘The Oracle’ — an instrumental piano piece that builds some nice momentum before reaching a grand crescendo. In these times of crisis, all one requires is to plug your earphones and listen to ‘The Oracle’. The magic in its notes gives us hope.",entertainment

The goal here is to get people to help stem the spread of the Coronavirus by self-isolating and maintaining social distance. He explains in the video, “The contact you make with someone who makes contact with someone else: that may be what makes somebody’s mom, grandpa or wife sick. Everyone of us has someone who is worth staying home for.”

Ugadi in the time of Coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ugadi-2020-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/article31152369.ece,"In times like these, festivals do cheer us up, celebrations within the family notwithstanding. Ugadi is celebrated across different communities to mark the new year and brings family members together over a traditional meal. Having the traditional Ugadi Pachchadi first thing in the morning and listening to Panchanga Sravanam is a customary part of the celebrations for Telugus and Kannadigas. With most cities under lockdown due to COVID-19, the celebrations this year will not be the same though.

Jhillam Chattaraj looks forward to Ugadi for two reasons. Being a Bengali and married to K Uttam, a Telugu, Ugadi heralds festivities with Bengali new year to be celebrated next month. For the couple, the festival holds a cultural significance and gives a space of intimacy to them living and working in two different cities. On Ugadi, the duo also visit Uttam’s grandfather in CR Foundation Home For the Aged in Kondapur. Over a traditional meal, the couple spend the day chatting sharing and recollecting memories. However, this year Jhillam, a poet and assistant professor in English at RBVRR Women’s college will spend the day alone at home reading poetry. “Due to the lockdown, my husband cannot come from Sangareddy; I will read and upload my poems on Instagram,” she says, adding technology is liberating in these times.
“Without technology we would have been so isolated. Friends and students will share pictures of the feast. The communication is on; Even if physically we are away, emotionally we are connected. In fact, it has now brought people emotionally closer.” She calls festivals a reminder of hope and something good to look forward to. “In times like these when the world is in crisis, festivals cheer us up. We are emotionally needy people and festivals energise us. Rituals make us forget the mundanity of life. This time all our prayers for everyone’s safety”
For Pavan Kumar and his wife Ashwani living in Singapore, Ugadi brings special memories. The couple celebrating their first anniversary on the eve of Ugadi had initially planned to come to their parents’ house in Hyderabad. “Group video calls with family and friends living in Hyderabad is the best thing happening now. We are more connected than ever,” says Pavan. 
It has been a ritual and professor Sagi Kamalakar Sarma has been following for 10 years now. Every Ugadi, he is at at Shilparamam reading Panchanga Sravanam and interpreting the almanac readings to the audience. “Panchanga Sravanam is an intrinsic part of Ugadi festivities but this year, I am not taking any risk and going anywhere. I will do a pooja at home,” he adds. 
With all the shoots cancelled, television star Suma is at home. “We will not celebrate Ugadi this year because we lost my father-in-law Devadas Kanakala. Also because of the conditions prevailing in the world, we need to be mentally strong and hope and pray that we come out of Coronavirus lockdown and everybody is responsible and stays safe at home and healthy. Let us hope we are successful in breaking the Corona chain and are able protect us and our families.” 
On small screen, she brings a special Ugadi episode on her new show House of Hungama (Wednesday; 9.30 pm) on Star Maa and has also participated a special Ugadi event for the channel. “Thank god these shows were shot earlier and we have banked a few of them. With all the free time, I plan to make videos for my YouTube channel Sumakka on my own without taking assistance.”

The minister, however, offered little clarity on the composition of an economic task force announced by the Prime Minister last week, and explained that the delay in announcing an economic package was on account of the need for extensive consultations, which had been delayed as Parliament had been in session till Monday and the Finance Bill had had to be cleared.

“Work is going on and we are very close to coming out with an economic package, which will be announced sooner rather than later,” Ms. Sitharaman said, adding that the Centre, the Reserve Bank of India and the regulators had been jointly monitoring the volatility in the stock markets thrice daily. “Every attention is being given to the economy. The Prime Minister himself is closely monitoring the situation. A multi-layered composition of the task force is already working.”
As The Hindu had reported on Tuesday morning, the economic task force announced in the PM’s address to the nation on March 19 has still not been constituted, with the Finance Ministry saying that the PM’s Office or the Cabinet Secretariat would be responsible for issuing an order to create it. On Tuesday evening, after the FM’s press conference, a Finance Ministry spokesperson once again confirmed that no order had as yet been issued to set up the task force.
Ms. Sitharaman was more ambiguous about the status of the task force, saying that sub-groups of MPs, academics and industry leaders were already generating ideas for the task force, but refusing to elaborate on its composition or specific mandate.

“The Finance Ministry is working intensively on all these suggestions which are coming in from the various sub groups within the multi-layered task force that exists,” she said. “So the work of the task force which is multi-layered is already almost intensively nearing a conclusion. So the task force and the task force based report and the action following the task force’s report are almost at its peak and that is why I have said we will announce the economic package sooner rather than later.”
Ms. Sitharaman also declined comment on specific queries about how the economic package would provide relief for millions of informal sector and daily wage workers who have been hit the hardest by the shutdown.
“I appreciate that you would have liked the package to be announced last week,” the minister told journalists at the press conference. “But most things which are as big as an economic package for this kind of unusual situation requires a lot of consultation to get it right,” she added.
“We had no intention to delay, we don’t want to delay, but then but let us be realistic. Till yesterday, the Parliament was in session and the Finance Bill had to be cleared,” she said, adding that she would have been happy to announce the package in the House if it was ready and the Finance Bill had been passed. “And once the Finance Bill got cleared, it was important for the MPs to recognise there is a lockdown in this country, so everyone had to go where they had to go and serve and be of use for their own constituents.

FMCG companies see a spurt in ‘COVID-19 sales’,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fmcg-companies-see-a-spurt-in-covid-19-sales/article31156697.ece,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in the demand of consumer staples like milk, milk products and biscuits along with hand sanitisers as people are stocking up essentials amid a complete lockdown like scenario.
Companies like Amul, Parle and Godrej Consumer Products have seen a 10-15% jump in demand across product categories and ramped up production to meet the growing demand.
This assumes significance as more States initiate a complete lockdown amid a growing number of confirmed cases of the virus, which would only push up the demand for such staples.
“We have seen an increase of 15-20% in our average daily sales across most product categories as consumers are stocking products like milk, butter, ghee, cheese and paneer,” said R.S. Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns Amul.
Some States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and Delhi have imposed stern restrictions on people movement, along with a lockdown, which has made consumers wary of essential products going out of stock, thereby leading to panic buying.
The popular Parle G biscuit has also seen a notable increase in demand on the back of panic buying.
“There is a bit of panic buying and we have seen around 10-15% increase in our average weekly sales of Parle G,” said Parle Products category head Mayank Shah.
Apart from food essentials, products like hand washes have also seen an increase in sales as authorities have been highlighting the importance of sanitising hands at regular intervals.
“In some categories, such as hand washes and sanitisers, we have seen temporary spike in demand, driven by the impact of COVID 19,” said Vivek Gambhir, MD and CEO, Godrej Consumer Products.
“We have also heard of some instances of consumers trying to hoard essentials. Retailers have begun to put restrictions on quantities being purchased. We believe that there should be no reason to panic as there should be sufficient supplies available,” Mr. Gambhir added.
To meet the increased demand, companies have also ramped up their production as the virus threat is not showing any signs of abating as of now. “We have recently ramped up production of soaps by 30% and have increased production of liquid hand washes by 3.5X at our units as well as through our vendor partner units,” Mr. Gambhir said.
In a similar context, Mr. Shah said that the company had increased production by 15% while closely working with governments to ensure there is minimal logistical issue and all its trade partners have sufficient stock.
Incidentally, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which is the country’s largest pure play fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, has also reduced the prices of Lifebuoy sanitisers, Lifebuoy Liquid handwash and Domex floor cleaners by 15% and said that the products with the reduced prices would be available in the market in the next few weeks.

“RAI praises the State governments for allowing essential daily goods and pharmacy retailers to remain open so citizens are not deprived of daily need items. All retailers are committed to selling and delivering essentials in a safe manner,” RAI said in a statement. 
“However, in some unfortunate incidents in the States of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat the local police are going beyond word of law, beating employees and delivery staff of such retailers, and taking them to chowkis for doing their duty.

A tribute to Visu: How Lakshmi was the moral centre of ‘Samsaram Adhu Minsaram’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/samsaram-adhu-minsaram-tribute-piece/article31154295.ece,"“You cannot choose your family,” says a character in the Academy Award-winning movie Parasite. However, the Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda — who has a fetish for writing heartwarming family dramas — put a fantastic spin on this, steering clear of the perceived ideals of a ‘family’ with his gorgeously-shot Shoplifters, wherein the lead characters were given the liberty to pick and choose their family members, resulting in a spectrum of characters and an affecting drama.
Long before Kore-eda’s Shoplifters, there was Visu’s Samsaram Adhu Minsaram whose individual characters — Ammaiyappan Mudaliar, Godavari, Chidambaram, Uma, Siva and Kannamma — seemed to have been deported from Visu’s own universe, to deliver a larger point on familial values without romanticising the social conditions in which they live. What we got was a heightened drama and an intimate portrait of the family system, in the form of Samsaram Adhu Minsaram.

Any art, if viewed under the purview of today’s modern lenses, may appear stale and ‘problematic’. But what is particularly striking about Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, even after all these years, is the amount of sensitivity that went into fleshing out Lakshmi’s Uma. Now, let us not get into the progressive/regressive debate and analyse the existence of Lakshmi within the film’s context. Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, essentially, is an ego clash between Ammaiyappan and Mr Chidambaram. But the protagonist is neither of them, but Uma. She is the moral centre of the film’s universe and is the binding force that ties the family structure together. She is the nucleus of Samsaram Adhu Minsaram and the rest of the characters are treated as protons and neutrons, orbiting around Uma. Where Visu’s genius as a scriptwriter comes into play is the way he designed Uma’s character, which triggers a cause and effect for other characters.
You must have a fair knowledge on the Godavari’s line of control, which was drawn following a dispute between Ammaiyappan and Mr Chidambaram, on the pretext of returning ₹18,000 that the latter borrowed from the former for his daughter’s marriage. Ammaiyappan asked a simple question: “Don’t you know of the Ammaiyappan who pledged his gratuity savings for your security deposit?...” But Chidambaram’s reply was a resounding “no”.

Chidambaram realises his cocky attitude towards his father and the conflict is resolved in the end. But Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, I apologise for saying this, is dead meat without its brilliantly-staged climatic bit, shouldered by a terrific Lakshmi (it is sad that she never got her due and was relegated to playing mother characters). She could have well been awarded ‘fatafat’ Lakshmi for the key takeaways she espouses in the climax.

Visu, a colossus




 

Visu, a colossus

Up till this point, Visu’s screenplay plays to the conventions of what Kodambakkam expects. But here is where Samsaram Adhu Minsaram subverts its own tropes and ends up being slightly more than a message-heavy movie. With Uma making loud and uproarious statements, taking on every member of the family, Visu destroyed Tamil cinema’s practice of upholding the sentiments of the joint family. Therefore, in that single sequence, Visu gave one of the greatest lessons on a) the price you pay, if you cross borders and b) that it is important to draw a boundary and give each other their own space, even in a family.
This, I guess, was Visu’s biggest achievement — something even the ‘auteur’ directors failed to achieve. Of course, this isn’t to denigrate the works of other filmmakers. Hear me out: nobody spoke to the middle-class like how a Visu movie did. And it is safe to say that no other filmmaker came remotely close to depicting the travails of the working class and their typical ‘middle-class’ mentality the way Visu did — it ain’t limited to Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, but all his creations including the gloriously-underrated Simla Special.
In that sense, Visu did more to the bourgeois than Karl Marx himself. An ideal example of this ‘middle-class’ mentality would be the scene where Ammaiyappan almost demands that Godavari prepare four varieties of bajjis, in addition to kesari and Peaberry coffee. This is casually slipped in as a form of comical relief. But if you dig deeper, it shows the unbearable sadness of the working class — a sect that exploits the matchmaking ceremony as a gateway to rejoice in simple pleasures of life, like drinking Peaberry coffee or asking for an extra scoop of kesari. Having grown up in an extended family himself, Visu understood the dynamics, power structure and politics of a joint family. He brought the bourgeois out of their cocoon and gave them comfort through movies, even if it were for fleeting durations.
There is a LOL stretch in Samsaram Adhu Minsaram where Ammaiyappan describes each of the characters in the opening act. He reserves a cheeky remark for his youngest son, Bharathi, saying, “Ivan 12th ezhuthinan...ezhuthinan...ezhuthirkan and ezhuthuvan (he wrote, has written and will write).”
Who would have thought that this seemingly witty jibe would eventually become Visu’s own legacy with a slight modulation, of course? As long as the middle class exists, Visu will live on.",movies
This doctor uses Coronavirus quarantine time to make ‘Carantine’ videos,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-doctor-uses-coronavirus-quarantine-time-to-make-carantine-videos/article31153235.ece,"So many good doctors and medical professionals have emerged as frontline warriors in the global effort to push back against the deadly Coronavirus.
Sitting inside a parked car somewhere in one of Bengaluru’s many bylanes, Dr Jagdish Chaturvedi was confident that this war ought to be fought on multiple fronts. In India, one of these fights would be the containment of fake news and misinformation.
As the pandemic situation evolved and death tolls climbed, Jagdish whipped out his mobile phone and recorded short videos from his car, quelling rumours and putting down scientifically incorrect suggestions. He uploads these “Carantine videos” on his YouTube channel for over 1.26 lakh subscribers to watch. From quirky word play spun into a monologue interspersed with abundant comedy to out-of-rhythm rap videos, Jagdish keeps at it.
“There are two types of people in our country. There is the compliant population who are well-read, aware, diligent and interested to make things happen. Then there is the ignorant population who happen to be the larger majority,” says the multi-faceted Jagdish, who wears the many hats of an ENT surgeon, medical device innovator and entrepreneur, author, and stand-up comic.
For Jagdish, the troubling aspect of an explanatory video was that it wouldn’t be shared among the so-called ignorant populace, that routinely forwards ridiculous WhatsApp messages.
“Controversial content gets lot of shares and engagement. If I shoot the content sitting in my hospital chamber and talking about Coronavirus, people won’t share it thinking ‘Why do I need to bore or scare someone or spoil their day?’ When it is comedy, they think ‘I want my friend to look at it’,” he adds.
While he continues to shoot and engage with his subscribers on YouTube, Jagdish also debuted a web series last month. Titled Starting Troubles, the six-episode series stars Renuka Shahane, Kurush Deboo, Parikshit Sahni and others besides Jagdish. It is based off a book he authored Inventing Medical Devices: A Perspective from India.

The brains behind 18 medical devices (a portable ENT endoscope with a digicam attached being one) Jagdish, in his book, details how he was nudged towards medtech by his seniors. “I wrote the book with the purpose to encourage more doctors to become innovators,” he says.
There was, however, one small problem. Much like the WhatsApp populace, younger doctors in this generation need encouragement to pick up a book (aside academics) and read.
“A friend of mine, Dr Shweta Malik, told me that youngsters do not read books. Also the creative types, they are offbeat. They may not be readers and that is where the thought of taking things off the book came about,” he says, adding, “[Shweta] suggested we turn the contents of the book into a short film or web series or a documentary. The moulding and encouragement for doctors to become innovators has to happen in their MBBS days because once their career gets going, it is hard to make that break.”
Starting Troubles features a doctor in training who wants to be an entrepreneur, and balances work with his passion for acting. But his actions get him suspended from his course and banned from the theatre community. What happens thereafter is the plot.
The story is similar to Jagdish’s own experience growing up. He used to be in theatre, and this experience is what he attributes for his effortless ability to deliver monologues in his YouTube content and standup comedy gigs. When he could no longer attend theatre rehearsals, as he was required to be at the hospital where he was training, he was ousted from the community.

He filled this vacuum theatre left in his life with stand up comedy. “What we have shown in the web series are real life anecdotes,” he says.
Convincing senior artistes to come on board, surprisingly, was less of a task for Jagdish. “I wanted someone elegant and powerful to play my boss Dr Ravi Nayar on screen. Now I’m an ’80s kid and I grew up watching Surabhi. I thought what if we reached out to Renuka Shahane. We didn’t have a phone number and only an email. We didn’t really expect a reply, you know, we were amateurs with little budget trying to film something in a few days. But it was courteous of her to read the script and she came on board saying she wanted to support the concept. She was happy to play a doctor which had actual medical terms in the dialogues,” he adds.
The six episodes of Starting Troubles stream on HiiiH, a startup medtech portal founded by Jagdish.

He hopes Starting Troubles will draw medical students to the portal, which can then be used as a platform to explore sponsors and services to fund innovation.
“Medtech and health care revolves around doctors. Today, what is happening is that the innovation happens without the involvement of doctors. Our ecosystem is also immature with only a few hundred medical startups in place. It is this core problem we want to address via HiiiH,” says Jagdish.
With a dedicated team of seven people including for marketing and technical sections, HiiiH, in Jagdish’s words, is like a “speed dating platform”. At the moment, there are about 150 consultants signed up on HiiiH offering a range of services to medical innovators in order to successfully help set up a company.

“In India, we still import 80% of our medical devices which is the reason why cost for treatment is high. Ours is a mature import market but we export 60% of what we develop, and so there is less know how of the needs and process,” he adds.
What drives him to explore such solutions, whether it is to mitigate issues around healthcare or making “Carantine videos”, has to do with Jagdish’s own character trait of being impatient. “I’m attracted to things that can be done quickly and which leave an impact. But my perspective as a doctor is different. I’m very patient with my patients,” he concludes.",movies
Coronavirus: Netflix India to reduce traffic on telecom networks to manage congestion ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-netflix-india-to-reduce-traffic-on-telecom-networks-by-25-percent-to-manage-congestion/article31151267.ece,"Streaming giant Netflix on Tuesday said it will reduce traffic on telecommunications networks by 25 per cent while maintaining the quality of service for users in India, as part of its efforts to help mitigate network congestion amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 Companies like Amazon Prime Video are also temporarily lowering bit rates —a measure of how much data is being transferred — to ease pressure on telecom network infrastructure.
 Consumption of digital content has gone up manifold as people are forced to stay indoors as almost the entire country is under lockdown to contain the spread of the deadly COVID-19.
 “Given the crisis, we’ve developed a way to reduce Netflix’s traffic on telecommunications networks by 25 per cent while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan: whether it’s Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,” Netflix VP Content Delivery Ken Florance said in an emailed statement.
 He added this will provide significant relief to congested networks, and the measure will be deployed in India for the next 30 days.
 The company, which has over 167 million users globally, has already undertaken similar measures in Europe. It doesn’t provide country-specific subscriber numbers.
 Netflix typically has many different streams for a single title within each resolution. This action would result in removal of the highest bandwidth streams, and so, subscribers will continue to have access to the service they have paid for (Ultra-High Definition, High Definition or Standard Definition) depending on the device they use.
 In India, Netflix has a significant number of subscribers on the Mobile Plan which is Standard Definition.
Amazon Prime Video on Monday also said it has begun efforts to reduce streaming bitrates in India. Bitrate usually determines the size and quality of video and audio files. Higher bitrate indicates better quality.
 The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) had written to the government urging issuance of instructions to streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and others to initiate measures that will ease pressure on network infrastructure, which is needed for “critical” functions at this juncture.
 “We support the need for careful management of telecom services to ensure they can handle the increased internet demand with so many people now at home full-time due to COVID-19...In India, we’ve already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates whilst maintaining a quality streaming experience for our customers,” an Amazon Prime Video spokesperson had said.
 A Hotstar spokesperson had said said the company’s video streaming is based on adaptive bitrate streaming, which ensures that it is “lean” in internet consumption. However, the company said it is “prepared to reduce the bitrate for our HD streams, should the need arise”. PTI SR DRR DRR 03241037 ",movies

Navdeep calls this period a test of our compassion, and urges viewers to give their domestic staff paid holidays so that they too can stay home, safe. 
Adivi Sesh focuses on why the young, who think they have higher immunity levels and are invincible, should also stay at home and not unwittingly become carriers of COVID-29 and thereby put children and elderly at home at risk. 
The IIHFW Instagram account also has suggestions on how to spend the lockdown period creatively, without giving in to boredom — write a poem, learn something new, listen to music, watch movies or read, but definitely stay home to break the chain, and say no to visitors.
On Sunday, to coincide with the Janata Curfew, 28 Telugu film personalities had a relay 30-minute Instagram live session each, to engage with followers and talk about COVID-19 as well as infuse light-hearted creative banter to tide over the tough phase.",movies

The 36-year-old actor, who took to social media to share his diagnosis, said he is feeling much better now.
“I’m feeling much better. I consider myself extremely lucky that my symptoms have been very mild —cold like with no fever —as so many are experiencing much more serious symptoms, because this is a very dangerous virus,” Tveit wrote on Instagram.
 The actor said he had been quarantined since Broadway shows shut down on March 12 amid the pandemic.
 One thing I have been experiencing is the loss of taste and smell, which I think is a big sign for people who are otherwise asymptotic, he added. 
Tveit said he was tested earlier last week and found out the results this Monday, but had quarantined himself even before he went through the medical procedure. “This can affect anyone and even if you aren’t feeling sick or showing drastic symptoms — please take heed, stay safe, stay healthy and I hope to see everyone at the theater again soon,” he said. 
Tveit is known for the roles of Gabe in Next to Normal, Frank Abagnale Jr. in the stage version of Catch Me If You Can, and as Christian in Moulin Rouge! The Musical on Broadway. He is also known for his recurring role as Tripp van der Bilt on The CW’s teen drama series Gossip Girl, and other shows like Graceland and Grease Live. 
Tveit joins a growing list of celebrities that have tested positive for coronavirus, including Idris Elba, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, Kevin Durant, former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, “Frozen 2” actor Rachel Matthews, Daniel Dae Kim, “Game of Thrones” star Kristofer Hivju, veteran Opera singer Placido Domingo and celebrated TV host Andy Cohen.

At least 28% of regular film-goers still see no reason to stay away from movie theatres, if they were hypothetically open and a film they wanted to watch was showing, said the study, conducted by Mumbai-based media consulting firm, Ormax Media.
The study, titled 'Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Theatre-Going Behaviour in India' is being conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu film industry zones with a sample size of 1,200 committed film-goers every week. In view of the situation, which is changing each day, Ormax is conducting the study every three days and coming up with the findings twice a week. 
The fifth in the series of surveys, conducted between March 19 and 22, shows that 72% of the country’s film buffs would stay away from theatres till the threat of the novel coronavirus reduced.
It does show a rise from 58% in the March 16-18 poll but not as much as one would have expected. The figure stood at 33% in the poll conducted between March 12 and 15, 26% in the one conducted between March 9 and 11 and 23% between March 6 and 8.
At least 75% of viewers in the Hindi-speaking markets have said they will stay away as opposed to 57% in the previous poll and 39%, 28% and 26% in the ones before that.

"Economic package soon, says FM",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economic-package-soon-says-fm/article31156606.ece,"An economic package to deal with COVID-19 situation will be announced soon, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman promised on Tuesday afternoon, adding that the government and regulators are constantly monitoring the state of the economy, markets and rupee depreciation.
However, she still offered little clarity on the composition of an economic task force announced by the PM last week, and explained the delay in announcing an economic package by saying extensive consultations were needed, and till yesterday, Parliament was in session and the Finance Bill had to be cleared.
“Work is going on and we are very close to coming out with an economic package, which will be announced sooner rather than later,” she said, adding that the Centre, the Reserve Bank and the regulators have been jointly monitoring the volatility in the stock markets thrice daily. “Every attention is being given to the economy. The Prime Minister himself is closely monitoring the situation. A multi-layered composition of the task force is already working.”
As The Hindu had reported on Tuesday morning, the economic task force announced in the PM’s address to the nation on March 19 has still not been constituted, with the Finance Ministry saying the PM’s Office or the Cabinet Secretariat would be responsible for issuing an order to create it. On Tuesday evening, after the FM’s press conference, a Finance Ministry spokesperson once again confirmed to The Hindu that no order has yet been issued to set up the task force.
Ms. Sitharaman was more ambiguous about the status of the task force, saying that sub-groups of MPs, academics and industry leaders were already generating ideas for the task force, but refused to elaborate on its composition or specific mandate. “The Finance Ministry is working intensively on all these suggestions which are coming in from the various sub groups within the multi-layered task force that exists,” she said. “So the work of the task force which is multi-layered is already almost nearing a conclusion. So the task force and the task force based report and the action following the task force’s report are almost at its peak and that is why I have said we will announce the economic package sooner rather than later.”
She did not respond to specific queries on how the economic package would provide relief for millions of informal sector and daily wage workers who have been hit the hardest by the shutdown.
Ms. Sitharaman attributed the delay in announcing an economic package to the need for extensive consultations and to first pass the Finance Bill. “I appreciate that you would have liked the package to be announced last week. But most things which are as big as an economic package for this kind of unusual situation requires a lot of consultation to get it right,” she told journalists.
“We had no intention to delay, we don’t want to delay, but then but let us be realistic. Till yesterday, the Parliament was in session and the Finance Bill had to be cleared,” she said adding that she would have been happy to announce the package in the House if it was ready and the Finance Bill had been passed. “And once the Finance Bill got cleared, it was important for the MPs to recognise there is a lockdown in this country, so everyone had to go where they had to go and serve and be of use for their own constituents. So the Parliament adjourned sine die.”
In the final hours of the Lok Sabha session on Monday, a number of opposition MPs had been pressing the Finance Minister to make a statement on the COVID-19 situation and the government’s package before the Finance Bill was passed.",economy

 However, K.E. Raghunathan, past president, All India Manufacturers Association, said, “The deadline for February GST returns, which was due to be filed on March 20, should have also been extended as many MSMEs have not filed the returns for February as yet.”

RBI advances variable rate term repo auction,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-advances-variable-rate-term-repo-auction/article31156216.ece,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to to advance the first of the two variable rate term repo auctions to March 26 from March 30.
The central bank had announced two such auctions of ₹25,000 crore each on March 30 and March 31 to address the additional demand for liquidity. 
“On a review of the rapidly evolving financial conditions and taking into account the impact of disruptions caused by COVID-19, it has been decided to advance the first auction scheduled for March 30, 2020 to March 26, 2020” the RBI said in a statement.
There is no change in the auction scheduled for March 31, 2020.
“As a special case, standalone primary dealers (SPDs) were also allowed to participate in these auctions along with other eligible participants,” the central bank said in the statement.
It has been decided to temporarily enhance liquidity available to SPDs under the Reserve Bank’s Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) from ₹2,800 crore to ₹10,000 crore with immediate effect, in order to facilitate year-end liquidity management by SPDs.

Moody’s downgrades Indiabulls ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/moodys-downgrades-indiabulls/article31156237.ece,"Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded the corporate family rating (CFR) and foreign-currency senior secured rating of Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited (Indiabulls) to B3 from B2.
In addition, Moody’s has downgraded Indiabulls’ foreign and local currency senior secured MTN programme ratings to (P)B3 from (P)B2. The outlook on all ratings remains negative, it said, adding, “The downgrade and negative outlook reflect Moody’s expectation that Indiabulls’ access to funding will remain challenging for longer than expected. This is because wholesale funding markets remain largely closed to many financial institutions following the imposition of a moratorium on Yes Bank as well as the broader risk aversion currently prevalent in financial markets globally,” Moody’s said.
The rating agency further said that there is significant uncertainty around when Indiabulls will regain access to market funding which will result in an increase of Indiabulls’ reliance on asset sales as the primary source of liquidity to repay maturing obligations.
“Prima facie, expected cash inflows (customer loan repayments) are sufficient to meet outflows (debt repayments). However, loan repayment rates and debt prepayments are volatile, increasing the risk of a missed payment and as result the risk to creditors. Highlighting these risks, debt repayments over the last nine months ending December 31, 2019 were much higher than the company expected,” it said.
The rating agency said an extended period without access to funding could result in significant damage to Indiabulls’ franchise. The mortgage lender’s loan book has been contracting since December 2018, and new disbursements have reduced significantly. This could lead to reduction in profitability because of lower net interest margins and higher cost-to-income ratios.
Moody’s also expects the company’s asset quality will continue to weaken. “Real estate developers are among the most stressed borrowers in India and are facing the brunt of risk aversion by way of tight access to funding. With the operating environment in India remaining challenging, Moody’s expects the home loans and LAP portfolios will also continue to deteriorate,” it added. (End)

 Top gainers in the Sensex pack included Infosys, Bajaj Finance, Maruti, HUL, HCL Tech and Reliance Industries, while M&M, IndusInd Bank, ITC, PowerGrid and L&T were among the losers.
 According to experts, a major package from the government of India and the Reserve Bank is expected shortly, and the market is likely to remain hugely volatile with rising possibility of V shaped recovery occasionally.
 The US Fed is now leading from the front with its historic package which includes open-ended purchase of securities, direct loans to companies, purchase of corporate bonds, lending against student loans and credit card loans, they said.
 The Federal Reserve on Monday announced it will buy unlimited amounts of US Treasury debt – essentially printing money for the economy – as well as new steps to lend directly to small- and medium-sized companies that have been among the hardest-hit as economic activity dries up.
 Other central banks are also expected to follow suit with bold measures to ease the severely strained credit and financial markets, experts noted.
 Traders said extreme lockdown measures taken by the government of India and authorities across the world still weigh on global investor sentiment.

The Liverpool Echo reports that the rocker fell ill with COVID-19 symptoms a week ago before dying at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on Monday, reports dailymail.co.uk.
He is believed to be the first person to die of the fatal virus in Liverpool. It was confirmed that he had previously suffered with ill health, including diabetes and heart problems, and due to his age was considered to be at high risk.
Speaking to the portal, Tucker’s family said: “As a family we are devastated at the sudden loss of our husband, father-in-law, granddad, brother and friend who touched so many lives through music. To the city of Liverpool he was Cy Tucker, but to us he was our world. He forever doted on his family, especially his wife, children and grandchildren, who he always showered with affection...”
“Despite the pain and sadness, we have been comforted by the endless amount of messages we have received from those who watched him perform in many of Liverpool’s pubs and clubs for over 60 years,” they said.
“Performing on stage, be it big or small, was his great passion and he would never be afraid to get up and sing, even on family holidays,” they concluded.
Tucker was famously part of the “Merseybeat scene”, where he rubbed shoulders with a host of the most iconic stars to come out of the northern city.

Poetry in the times of Covid-19,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/poetry-in-the-times-of-covid-19/article31163319.ece,"Much is being written about this virus that “binds us, but holds us apart”. People have taken to verse to express their new realities and the internet abounds with poetry — on this new lifestyle that has taught us not to take anything for granted, this new quietude we are very unused to.
#coronapoetry and covid19 poetry are trending on social media. Instagram has poets’ communities from around the world versifying by the minute about the challenges the virus has thrown up — isolation, quarantine, sickness and loneliness. Many, however, also look at it as an opportunity to slow down and savour life, one day at a time.
Irish priest, Brother Richard Hendrick’s poem Lockdown is one such. It went viral, as the world resonated with it. He speaks of the birds that have begun to sing again and of skies that have turned blue again. He shared it as a FaceBook post on March 13 and it starts thus:
“Yes there is fear.
Yes there is isolation.
Yes there is panic buying.
Yes there is sickness.
Yes there is even death.
But,
They say that in Wuhan after so many years of noise
You can hear the birds again....”
The BBC Radio broadcast it as a plea to pause, listen and reflect.
“Humans have always had their own ways to cope with disaster and literature and poetry have always been born out of great suffering,” says Bhaskaran Bara, artist, writer and poet. “Now, we have the facility to air our haikus and verses instantly as they occur to us.”
British poet Simon Armitage in a poem, (also titled 'Lockdown') remembers the villagers of Eyam in Derbyshire, who locked themselves up during the 17th century outbreak of plague:
“And I couldn’t escape the waking dream
of infected fleas
In the warp and weft of soggy cloth
By the tailor’s hearth...”
Actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote a few lines in Hindi, urging people to stay safe.
“In times such as these, we all have our coping methods. Poetry is mine,” says Aditya Jadhav, who runs a digital marketing company and poet. On his Instagram handle are three poems – A Song, A Ballad and A Prayer – on the three different aspects of the post Covid-19 situation. While ‘A Song’ is hopeful, stating that it took a calamity to make us appreciate simple things about life, ‘A Ballad’ is an ode to the healthcare professionals who work tirelessly. The last in the series is an impassioned prayer to the universe to lend us strength to tide over these troubled times:
“He captured the world, every village
every city
Invincible and dangerous than
anybody has ever been
But little did he know of the secret
army
The army of heroes clad in white and green...”
Any art can help you tackle the gloom, says Meena Shaktivanam, who has been putting up stories, songs and limericks on Instagram for children who have to stay indoors this vacation. Her Kunjiamoomma stories have been made for “corona times”, she says.
Poet Jeena Mary Chacko from Bangalore writes in her poetic FB post that the “Great Isolation” has taught her a few things about life:
“That I long for things to go back to normal. I long for my workstation, my routine, the white board, my purple markers and the wooden duster I keep in my desk....That life is persistent and relentless ....That uncertainty is the only constant.”
Ultimately, it is about taking a re-look at your priorities, says Kristin Flyntz in her poem, “An imagined letter from Covid 19 to Humans,” which was shared over 27,000 times on social media and is still being passed around. In it, she writes:
“Despite what you might think or feel, we are not the enemy
We are messenger. We are Ally. We are a balancing force
We are asking you.

Recipient of the Padma Shri award in 2010, Ghosh had authored many books, such as Satyajit Ray at 70 (1991), Satyajit Ray: A Vision of Cinema (2005) and Manik-Da: Memories of Satyajit Ray (2011).
Ghosh was introduced to Ray by actor Robi Ghosh on the sets of his film Goope Gyne Baagha Byne in 1969. He documented the maestro at work till Ray passed away in 1992.
After Ray’s demise, he dedicated his energies to other areas, and the landscape of the city he lived was a recurrent theme in his photographs. The black and white images in his collection Nemai Ghosh Kolkata (2014) are a rich tribute to the city. He also documented tribal life in Bastar in Chattishgarh, Kutch in Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh.

 His photographs have been exhibited at numerous galleries in Kolkata and beyond, including at a permanent exhibition at St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata. Recently, his collection of photographs on Ray was exhibited at the renovated Currency Building in the city. The exhibition at the monument that was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year was titled Satyajit Ray, The Man, His Films & The City.
Madhuja Mukherjee, professor of Film Studies at Jadavpur University, said Ghosh created or introduced a culture of “director-oriented documentation, which was a remarkable shift from the star-centric production stills of the earlier period”. 
“He also recorded the process of film shooting, which is valuable for film history, and he was able to conjure a style particularly focussing on Ray,” Prof. Mukherjee added. 
She pointed out that it was difficult to find directors at work from the same period, particularly the likes of Guru Duttor Mehboob Khan. “In most cases, they (Guru Dutta and Mehboob Khan) are seen posing, while Ray is principally seen in action,” she added. ",entertainment
How the small screen is working sans any regulation in Kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/how-television-channels-are-working-sans-any-regulations-or-guidelines/article31161816.ece,"Tragedy porns, soap sagas and reality shows have become the staple of Malayalam television. Viewer fatigue might have forced television channels to take a hiatus from certain kinds of reality shows and jaded themes. But that, for sure, is going to be a mini-break and the programmes are sure to return in glittering new formats. Meanwhile, programme heads are furiously reworking old favourites and remodelling some worn-out staples of international channels for Malayali audiences. Some of the serials have even been given titles of yesteryear hits of Malayalam cinema. Originality is perhaps a rare phenomenon on our small screen. The series, serials and programmes on the small screen have been cruising along sans any regulations or guidelines that are enforced on cinema.
However, recently, an episode in a reality show on a leading private channel, in which one of the participants had applied chilli paste on a fellow participant’s eyes, raised a hue and cry. Eventually, the sadistic participant was thrown out of the show and that created an uproar among a section of viewers. Moreover, to add insult to injury, while many in Kerala were trying to conform to the government’s directive to maintain social distancing to contain the coronavirus outbreak, a crowd that gathered at the Cochin International Airport to receive the unconscionable misogynist who had been evicted from the show shocked and angered many. The State government immediately took action against those assembled there and the contestant was arrested and so were some of his supporters.

The incident and the profusion of misogynistic sob sagas, serials promoting superstition, inappropriate content for children and talk shows involving children have raised questions about the need to take a closer look at what is being telecast on the idiot box.
“Actually, most of the channels seem to be in the dark about a broadcasting code that is universally followed. BBC has a regulatory authority called Office of Communications (Ofcom), the government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the broadcasting industry in the UK. There are very strict guidelines by Federal Communications Commission in the US, European Broadcasting Union and so on. In India, the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council looks into complaints about content telecast on TV channels. Programmes are supposed to adhere to the Indian Broadcasting Foundation’s Self Regulatory Guidelines as well as Programming Code. So, when these private television channels apply for licensing, all of them give an undertaking that they will follow the existing guidelines in the country, which includes a code for broadcasting, one for commercials on the channel and so on, which is all very detailed and they also pay a bank guarantee and undertake that the guidelines will be followed in letter and spirit. Unfortunately, none of the private channels do that. Either they are not aware of it or the guidelines are pretty loose,” explains K Kunhikrishnan, former Additional Director General of Doordarshan and the first director of Doordarsan in Kerala. 
He adds that private channels “operate only for commercial gains and influence-peddling. So, normally, the government in power ignores it. But there is a limit to which the government can ignore this. There must be some mechanism to oversee what goes on in the name of entertainment, infotainment, news and news-based programmes on television screens. Television monitoring systems are expected to be followed at the State level but I am not aware of any such committee in Kerala. In 2017, the Supreme Court had directed that the media monitoring committees should be made operational. But nothing is followed here. One does not have unfettered freedom to say anything about anybody, and right now, there are many programmes that get away with murder,” he adds. 
Asha Joseph, Dean of Cinema and Television Studies at Sacred Hearts College, Thevara, and a former TV producer, says the history of television can be divided into two: the Nehruvian and after. Till the nineties, television channels, even Asianet, the first one in Kerala to come up in the private sector, existed in the Nehruvian era and followed socialist ideals and a progressive, developmental agenda. 
“But by the late nineties, all that vanished and now the only aim of every channel is to make money and win TRP ratings at any cost. Everything else has been thrown to the wind. There is no social responsibility or ethics followed and, unlike cinema, which is subject to several restrictions, television seems to be a free for all. There is not even an effort to encourage a scientific temper. The kind of violence that is shown on screen towards children and inappropriate content involving children are shocking. The less said about the so-called programmes for children and involving children, the better. By telecasting sob sagas, channels have steadily eroded our sensibilities and encouraged a kind of voyeurism that does not bode well for a good society. And remember, television comes into our homes,” she says.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that even the worst of revivalist content in soaps and programmes get sponsors, and channels go all out to promote it to win eyeballs. As Kunhikrishnan points out, such programmes are watched by viewers between the ages of two and 90, especially women.
Psychologist and actor Mala Parvathy says the government must undertake studies at the earliest to understand the damage caused by each show and programme, especially those that promote patriarchy, misogyny and negativity. “It is a celebration of mediocrity and sensationalism. By constantly beaming such unrealistic content, we are grooming a desensitised generation who might feel that the violence, physical and emotional, dysfunctional families and unrealistic women characters they see on screen are real. Some of the reality shows encourage body shaming, incredibly cut-throat competition and all the negative aspects that appeal to the basest characteristics in us. Instead of fostering positivity, sadly, the programmes encourage a narcissistic attitude,” she explains.
Parvathy says there must be some sort of mechanism to see that the content on television does not go against the laws of the land or promote voyeuristic and revivalist ideas.

Agreeing with her, veteran anchorperson Rekha Menon says: “As far as I’m concerned, such content is completely unacceptable and is to be flagged immediately. Nevertheless, calling for a ban on something, however regressive it may be, is not the answer. As it is, we are living in an age where freedom of expression is under threat. A ban will just open a Pandora’s box. However, it is important to call out misogynistic acts, and the fact that there is a backlash against this completely horrendous behaviour on the part of a participant in a popular show is a good sign. The only way such unacceptable behaviour can be countered is by putting pressure on the producers, channel and advertisers and send a strong message that this kind of content is not acceptable. Public opinion is a strong weapon and must be used. Nothing works better than flagging something as unpopular since that is what makers of popular content want their products to be. It is a good sign that there is a strong anti-current to this.” 
She adds: “This misogyny is not surprising, considering the regressive stuff that our daily soaps are full of. There should be a backlash against that as well. We are fighting against a mindset here and the only way to do that is to voice your opinion strongly against all such content.” 
Instead of a censor board on the lines of cinema, all of them agree that the need of the hour is a self-regulatory body in all television channels that keeps a close watch on what is telecast and evaluates them and then take necessary steps to flag and stop content that is not in keeping with the times we live in. “The kind of stuff that is being aired does not do us any credit as a creative people or as viewers of such sub-standard programmes,” sums up Parvathy.",entertainment

Having said that, we are also doing the best we can to make the most of our time now, be it working from home, slow cooking, or finding new hobbies.

It’s essential to keep our creative juices — as well as our body — moving, and that can be difficult being cooped up in the bedroom. However, Spotify’s ‘Workout’ playlist has got some great pop music to really lift the mood and motivate you to do some yoga, go for a quick walk/run around the apartment or do some stretches. 5 Seconds of Summer, The Chainsmokers, Diplo... represent!

Not to be a downer, but sometimes it’s okay to give in to the stress and anxiety, and wait for it to pass. With everything going on around us, it’d be surprising if we don’t feel those world-is-ending vibes. Music has a really therapeutic effect at such times to help us tide past it, and this playlist is perfect for it: Band of Horses, Halsey, Sam Fender are some of the stand-outs here. It’s indie rock at its finest.

Multiplayer video games to keep you social during the COVID-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/multiplayer-video-games-to-keep-you-socialising-during-the-covid-19-lockdown/article31160860.ece,"Who says gaming is an anti-social sport? Sure, the stereotypical image of gamers sees them nestled into a couch with a day’s worth of snacks around them as neither their gaze never strays from the monitor in front of them nor their fingers budge from the controller or keyboard. We bet that’s changing now.

With the lockdown underway across the country, people yearn for the company of their friends and families. That said, the digital space compensates with the power of communication and entertainment, and nothing is quite as interactive as gaming. Plus, it shoves unnecessary small talk aside, sending you right into the centre of the action.
Here is MetroPlus’ pick of multiplayer games that will have you feeling a little less alone in these hard times:
Minecraft 
We’ll start this off easy. Minecraft is one of the gaming industry’s best world-building games. Despite the simplicity of its pixellated design, the game offers countless possibilities of building a kingdom, playing virtual Hunger Games, or replicating your actual home. Kids, in particular, take a shining to the Education Edition as it gamifies learning and catalyses creativity on many levels.

Minecraft also appeals to the tech-savvy for its impressive scripting tools, and the massive player pools in Minecraft also make it ideal for those missing their friends and family. Yes, we know a digital environment is not a substitute, but in the lockdown we are in now, can we afford to be picky? 
Minecraft is available on most mainstream gaming, mobile and PC platforms.
The Sims 4
Have you really gotten into gaming if you haven’t done a several-hour binge of The Sims? Electronic Arts have perfected the second-life game sub-culture over the years since the Windows-exclusive release in 2000. Yes, The Sims franchise is 20 years-old now. This game is ideal if you’re down ‘meet’ your friends at the virtual club you built and dashing away to the nearby castle for some romance... but we do ask you not to take break-ups on here too seriously.

That said, the Sims 4 escalates the experience with better persistent worlds, emotionally-driven activities and an improved Build Mode which will turn you into an architectural genius. What an apt game in the time of social distancing.
The Sims 4 is available on MacOS, Windows, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
FIFA 20
Is there a better multiplayer game to play during a lockdown? For generations, friends from across continents have bonded over the FIFA Ultimate Team feature of the game that continues to evolve with newer versions. Featuring over 30 official leagues, 700 clubs and 17,000 players, the licensing is the real win here over eternal rivals Pro Evolution Soccer.

While FIFA 20 comes with its fair share of detractors, there have been enough tweaks in the gameplay to keep players occupied for hours — and weeks — at a stretch. The much-criticised Career Mode (in which you manage a team over an entire season) could actually be a godsend for those in countries with slow/ regulated internet, and the new addition of VOLTA (inspired by street and Futsal games) makes for a lot of fun. The Journey Mode returns as well, and can be played offline, and offers the closest experience gamers get towards experiencing a real footballer’s life in its storyline mode, with all its drama and off the pitch decisions. 
Ultimately, FIFA remains what it always has been: the perfect ‘outdoor’ social gaming experience. 
FIFA 20 is available on Microsoft Windows, PS4, XBox One and Nintendo Switch
PUBG
Despite a tumultuous realtionship with the government, the allure of Unreal Engine 4’s PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s Battleground) is undeniable. Unlike most games of this scale, PUBG had a soft launch but made quite an impact in gaming regimes the world over, with its anti-cheating mechanisms, rating protection cards and HDR Mode. Plus, the game, singular in form, has updates which come in the form of seasons, so once you have PUBG, do stay up to date.

Players go head-to-head in shrinking mapped areas, leading up to a battle royale of sorts. The adrenalin rush of PUBG is incomparable, due to the simple framework of the game. So don’t expect a rivetting storyline here; it’s all about getting in and being the last one standing. 
PUBG is available on PC, mobile, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Destiny 2: New Light
Richly detailed and brimming with purpose, Destiny 2 creates one of the richest atmospheres and storylines in gaming history. Bungie and Activision set players, as Guardians, on a mission to unite three former comrades in order secure peace across the universe. New Light is stunning, too; it takes the cake for impressive design of its persistent state world.

We recommend taking a crack at its predecessor, purely for the rivetting storyline. In an MMO (massive multiplayer online) realm, join other Guardians for challenging co-op missions, or compete against them in a variety of PvP (player-versus-player) modes.
Destiny 2 is available on Playstation 4, Xbox One and MacOS.
Call Of Duty: Warzone
No multiplayer listicle is complete without Call Of Duty, whatever the version. Latest addition Warzone features the classic Call Of Duty battle rezz staples such as weapon looting and a vast player pool so there’s no limits to the number of comrades you can team up with. If you’re not ready for Warzone just yet, we would recommend Modern Warfare — of which Warzone is a part, but does not require a purchase in order to play Warzone. Modern Warfare is known for being a landmark in the franchise, offering multiple reviving options, item-weapon combinations, and stunning graphics.

The franchise has some committed die-hard fans out there too; Warzone saw more than 30 million players in less than two weeks post-launch, so you could very well make some interesting friends during a gaming session.

E-com players suspend services as lockdown starts,https://www.thehindu.com/business/e-com-players-suspend-services-as-lockdown-starts/article31167002.ece,"E-commerce firm Flipkart has temporarily suspended its services as the 21-day country-wide lockdown began on Wednesday.
The move comes after rival Amazon India said it will halt orders for non-essential products and is looking at prioritising customers’ critical needs. Likewise, Gurugram-headquartered Snapdeal on Wednesday said it is working towards completing delivery of essential goods. 
“Consequent to the order issued on March 24 by the Ministry of Home Affairs announcing a 21-day lockdown across India to contain the spread of COVID-19, we are temporarily suspending our services,” the Walmart-owned firm said in a blog.
It added, “Your needs have always been a priority, and our promise is that we will be back to serve you, as soon as possible.” A similar note was also visible to customers going to the Flipkart website.
A Snapdeal spokesperson said, “Snapdeal is working region-wise to complete as many deliveries of essential goods to our customers as possible as per local operating conditions. We are also actively supporting Central and State authorities to help streamline issues for e-commerce operations in order to effectively serve the needs of consumers.”
Meanwhile, Amazon India, in a blog on Tuesday, said a large number of districts/States are taking precautionary measures with extensive lockdowns and restricted movement of goods and people. At the same time, the platform is seeing an increased demand for priority products and important services.
“To serve customers’ most urgent needs while also ensuring safety of our employees, we are temporarily prioritising our available fulfilment and logistics capacity to serve products that are currently critical for our customers such as household staples, packaged food, healthcare, hygiene, personal safety and other high priority products,” it said.
It added, “This also means that we have to temporarily stop taking orders and disable shipments for lower-priority products.”
Amazon India said for all pending customer orders of lower-priority products, it is reaching out to customers and giving them a choice to cancel their orders, and receive a refund for prepaid items.
These changes, it said, are in effect from March 24, 2020.
“Amazon and our network of partners are helping communities around the world and in India to deliver much-needed supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them. We will remain focused on providing this vital service to people in India, especially to those most vulnerable, like the elderly or those without access,” it said.",business
Neuberg labs get nod for COVID-19 tests ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/neuberg-labs-get-nod-for-covid-19-tests/article31166978.ece,"The decision of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to approve 26 private pathological labs on March 24 to conduct COVID-19 tests is likely to expedite the sample testing process and ease the burden on government-run labs.

"Banks get ready for merger, albeit reluctantly ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/banks-get-ready-for-merger-albeit-reluctantly/article31166824.ece,"Almost half of the Indian public sector lenders — 10 to be precise, which will be merged to create four banks — are getting ready to amalgamate themselves in an exercise that takes effect from April 1.
The mergers, announced in August last, will start amid an unprecedented nationwide lockdown to fight the rapid spread of COVID-19. 
Banking services are exempt from the lockdown, but are operating with minimal staff at branches with curtailed business hours, primarily focussing on essential services such as withdrawals and deposits. Banks are encouraging customers to make use of their digital platforms for transactions.
“The entire focus right now is how to continue the essential services to customers with minimum staff,” said the chief executive of a public sector bank, who did not wish to be named.
“In such crisis times, customer service is the key. Merger can wait for a quarter, at least,” the executive added. 
In August 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the merger of 10 public sector banks into four. Oriental Bank of India and United Bank of India will be merged with Punjab National Bank; Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will be merged with Union Bank of India; Allahabad Bank will be merged with Indian Bank; and Syndicate Bank will be merged with Canara Bank.
According to the plan, only the balance sheets of these banks will be merged on April 1. All the branches of the transferor banks will become branches of the transferee bank. The actual integration of systems and processes of these banks will take time (up to a year). For example, if a customer of Andhra Bank goes to a branch which belonged to Corporation Bank before the merger (and a branch of Union Bank post merger), then the entry would still be made in Andhra Bank’s system. All the branches of Union Bank will have to maintain three separate software systems in the branches. The same is the case with all other merger-bound banks.
Also, the branding of the branches will have to change. The branches of the transferor banks will have to don the brand of the transferee bank. “With limited staff that are operating now and also the lockdown that is in place, it is going to be logistical nightmare to change the branding,” said a banker with a public sector bank.
Some bankers said the issue of postponing the merger was discussed among them informally, but no formal requests have been made to the Finance Ministry.
There are also performance-related concerns of the merged entity since economic activity has almost come to a halt due to the crisis, which will inevitably have a bearing on the bank’s performance.
A section of bankers is also of the view that it is too late to postpone the merger at this point of time since only less than a week is left for the process.
“It will be business as usual after the merger as there is no impact on the customer since only the balance sheets are merged,” said the chief executive of another merger-bound public sector bank. ",business
FinMin writes to RBI for relaxing farm loan NPA norms,https://www.thehindu.com/business/finmin-writes-to-rbi-for-relaxing-farm-loan-npa-norms/article31166820.ece,"The Finance Ministry has asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to relax asset classification norms for farm loans extended by banks following the stress faced by the agriculture sector.
In a letter addressed to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, the Ministry said, “it is requested to consider making appropriate relaxation in asset classification norms in respect of short-term agricultural crop loans for a period up to 30th June 2020.”
The letter, reviewed by The Hindu, cited a communication from the Agriculture Ministry which is considering an extension of the interest subvention scheme for the farm sector which, in turn, would require relaxation of NPA norms. As per the RBI’s asset classification norms, a loan is classified as non-performing by banks if repayment is due for more than 90 days.
“The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India, has [said that] in view of the unprecedented situation prevailing in the country on account of increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection and consequent lockdown across the country, they are actively considering the possibility of extending the benefit of interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive to short-term crop agriculture loans falling due between 29th March 2020 and 30th June 2020, if the loans are repaid by 30th June 2020,” the letter said.
“They have further stated the extension of the repayment date would require relaxation in asset qualification by RBI,” it added.
The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a lockdown across the country with economic and other activities coming to a grinding halt. As a result, industry and bankers have demanded a relaxation in bad loan norms, apart from economic stimulus from the government. A task force headed by finance minister Nirmala Sithararam has been formed to finalise an economic relied package. ",business
"Manisha Koirala: 'I wish I could do any of Meryl Streep’s movies, that would be a dream come true for me'",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/manisha-koirala-i-wish-i-could-do-any-of-meryl-streeps-movies-that-would-be-a-dream-come-true-for-me/article31167169.ece,"Manisha Koirala believes that roles for women have become meatier and more substantial in recent years both for younger actresses as well as for those like her who are in their 40s. Naturally, this makes the actor very happy and she’s looking forward to the release of Dibakar Banerjee’s Freedom as well as an American project scheduled this year. Before that, though, she will star in director Neeraj Udhwani’s debut film, Maska. The actor plays Diana Rustom Irani, a proud Parsi owner of a café in Mumbai who is steeped in her culture and heritage. She’s keen for her son to accept and continue the legacy of the café he is about to inherit. But the conflict arises when his dreams clash with her own. “The essence of the story is [the need] to preserve one’s culture,” states Koirala who was holidaying in Nepal when she was first approached for Maska. The film was narrated to her soon after and she was immediately inclined to take it up.
Koirala describes how the film holds on to the belief that while imbibing the modern is important, it should not come at the cost of one’s traditional values. “There is space for everything if we respect each other,” she states. To prepare for the role, Koirala visited Irani cafés, Parsi colonies, baugs and agiaries. “We couldn’t enter the agiary but we saw, sat and prayed from a distance,” she shares. The actress admits that this was not a character one could play without adequate preparation and hence watching documentaries and working with a Parsi diction coach were part of the research and training. “By the time I went on the floor, I was well-groomed,” she smiles adding that out that the role was incredibly well crafted which allowed her to slip into it with ease.
The actor, who was last seen in the anthology film Lust Stories, is enjoying a sort of second spring in films. While stating that the craft is what remains important, Koirala admits that she finds the digital space more professional and structured in its approach, especially with regard to its specified work hours and stringent contracts. She does emphasise that times have changed with storytelling becoming more nuanced allowing for experimentation. “I’m a little greedy in that… I wish I could do any of Meryl Streep’s movies, that would be a dream come true for me,” she reveals. While Koirala is happy devoting time to gardening, golfing and writing, she’s now dedicating time to also seek challenging work with a new generation of filmmakers. 
 Her’s is a career studded with massive critical and commercial hits, full of memorable moments that she continues to cherish. “My beginning itself was a blessing,” she remarks. Subhash Ghai’s Saudagar not only proved to be a good start but also gave the actor the opportunity to work with legends like Dilip Kumar and Raaj Kumar. While Feroz Khan’s Yalgaar did not do well, her performance garnered appreciation and was among the films that helped her draw the early attention of directors like Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Mani Ratnam, Mansoor Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali who made widely acclaimed films with her in the 90s. Koirala also mentions the late cinematographer Ashok Mehta as being among the people who mentored her and guided her towards many of the prominent projects she ended up becoming a part of. While noting that there have been undeniably dark phases in her life, she asserts that overall, “it’s been a great ride”.

The medical consultant for Steven Soderbergh’s ‘Contagion’ has now tested positive for coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-medical-consultant-for-steven-soderberghs-contagion-has-now-tested-positive-for-coronavirus/article31164479.ece,"Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin, who served as the medical consultant on Steven Soderbergh’s Hollywood drama Contagion, has tested positive for the coronavirus.
The movie, about the spread of a highly contagious and deadly virus, has come back in public consciousness as the world grapples with the coronavirus. The film, predictably, is enjoying a spike in popularity.
Lipkin, 68, revealed he had tested positive for the virus during an interview with Fox Business. He said he had an idea of where he contacted the virus but declined to elaborate further, reported IndieWire.
“I would like to say on this show tonight, this has become very personal to me, too. Because I have COVID as of yesterday. It’s miserable. If it can hit me, it can hit anybody. That’s the message I want to convey,” he said during the interview.
“It’s extraordinarily important that we harmonize whatever restrictions we have across the country. We have porous borders between states and cities and unless we’re consistent, we’re not gonna get ahead of this thing What New York, Chicago and Washington have done has been very, very helpful and I would like to see that implemented broadly across the United States,” he said.
Lipkin, who serves as the director of Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, was one of the leading figures in the scientific studies of the West Nile virus and the SARS coronavirus in the early 2000s.
He had also visited China in January during the coronavirus breakout there and had self-isolated himself for two weeks. Lipkin warned about the virus turning out to be a pandemic, which it has become, spreading to different countries around the globe.
Lipkin had agreed to work on Soderbergh’s movie because the filmmaker promised to accurately represent the science behind the spread of a virus.
According to Johns Hopkins twebsite, the total number of coronavirus cases stand at 436,159 globally. The epidemic has killed 19648 people around the world since it first emerged in China in December.",movies

Hrithik said while the world talks about humanity coming together, he believes it represents more than an idea, “especially for parents sharing custody of their kids“.
“How to keep their kids close to them without infringing on the right of the other who also has an equal right to be with his/her children.

"Amazon Prime Video introduces ‘Profiles’ option, similar to Netflix",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/amazon-prime-video-introduces-profiles-option-similar-to-netflix/article31163278.ece,"Amazon Prime Video has been one of the go-to OTT platforms in the recent times of quarantine and self-isolation, especially in India, where a lot of Hindi and other regional films immediately find presence, weeks after their release in theatres. 
But one gripe users have always had with the platform is the lack of separate ‘profile’ options for different viewers: something that the likes of Netflix and the newly-introduced Disney Plus have offered to consumers. 
Now, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and multiple members of the family binge-watching on the same account, Amazon Prime Video has finally decided to introduce the multiple profiles option that lets people have their own separate watch history, recommendations, progress on a show/ movie, as well as a watch list. The option can be seen on the top right-hand corner of the screen.
Upto six profiles can be created, compared to Netflix’s five, and the option of a kid’s profile is present as well. The new profiles can be deleted as well, and they have coloured avatars to identify between them. 
Amazon has stated that Prime Video profiles are currently available in selected countries only. In India, Prime Video has been quite affordable at Rs 999 a year, but in other countries like the US where it costs around $120 a year, this comes as a welcome surprise for different members in a household to manage their watch profiles. 
Amazon Prime Video profiles can be created and managed on select devices: Android and iOS devices, Fire tablets, Prime Video app on Fire TV (India-only), Chromecast, select Apple TVs, and in browsers everywhere. The option is not available on the Fire TV home screen, Alexa devices with a screen, and Fire Gen 9 or below tablets.",movies

High definition (HD) as well as ultra-HD shall both be suspended effective immediately, and the bitrates shall also be lowered to 480p. This measure has been taken to counter the unprecedented surge in mobile internet consumption as India prepares to spend three weeks at home in self-isolation, to battle the coronavirus spread. 
However, this move by the digital players is only for cellular networks and not for broadband.
According to a press release, the decision was taken during a virtual meeting organised by Uday Shankar, chairman, Star & Disney India, which was attended by top industry leaders: Sanjay Gupta (Google India), Ajit Mohan (Facebook India), Punit Goenka (Zee Entertainment Enterprises), NP Singh (Sony Pictures Networks), Sudhanshu Vats (Viacom18), Gaurav Gandhi (Amazon Prime Video), Nikhil Gandhi (Tiktok), Ambika Khurana (Netflix), Karan Bedi (MX Player) and Varun Narang (Hotstar).
“The government and the telecom operators are concerned about the total lockdown’s potential impact on the cellular network infrastructure. The digital industry is acutely aware of this challenge, and is committed to ensuring that all citizens are able to access mobile networks whenever and wherever they want,” read the statement.
Earlier last week, the Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI), that represents Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, had reached out to 12 video streaming platforms to implement measures such as reducing video quality. They had also written separately to the Department of Telecom on the same.
A lot of the streaming service providers, including YouTube, Netflix, MX Player, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Voot and ZEE5 have already announced that they have started taking steps to reduce strain on the Internet works.
Google-owned YouTube had also said in a statement earlier, that it is reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world.
“We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.
The spokesperson added, “Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today.”",movies
Stars of Mollywood show how ordinary folks can turn ‘superstars’ in the time of the coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/stars-of-mollywood-show-how-ordinary-folks-can-turn-superstars-in-the-time-of-the-coronavirus/article31161471.ece," 
Even in the midst of a break due to COVID-19, Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) and the Indian Adfilm Makers (IAM) switched on lights and camera for some action to shoot nine short films to create awareness about how to battle the Coronavirus as a society and practise social distancing to break the chain and stop the spread of the virus. The tag line of the films is ‘Nine superheroes and one villain, Corona’.
“The nine films are an initiative of FEFKA and IAM. The idea was planned and executed within two to three days just before the lockdown and the whole effort was led by teams of experienced and leading members of FEFKA and IAM. Directors Leo Thaddeus, Arun Gopy and Siddarth Siva were on location with the teams shooting the films. Sound, editing and music were all taken care of by our union members in charge of those departments. Three films have been released on YouTube on Wednesday. Five more will be released in the following days,” says film director B Unnikrishnan, general secretary of FEFKA, who heads the project along with Renji Panicker, scenarist, director and actor.
Wonder Woman Vanaja, featuring actors Muthumani and Sreeja Das, was the first to be released by Mohanlal on his Facebook page on Tuesday. It has been viewed by more than 40,000 viewers and counting. Featuring Manju Warrier’s voiceover, the less-than-one-minute film shows a lawyer, Vanaja, advising Sita, her domestic help, to stay at home and stay safe. Vanaja also gives Sita her salary to tide over the situation.
 




 
“As soon as the team got in touch with me, I agreed to be on board. The plot or the character did not matter. I liked the theme because the question of domestic workers and their livelihood is a grey area that is usually overlooked. The film focused on how important it was to ensure that they stayed at home without being forced to go without salary. The shoot was over in record time,” says Muthumani, a lawyer in real life who is working on her doctorate.
Directed by senior ad filmmaker Vinod A K, the film’s music has been composed by Rahul Raj. “We are working on a war footing. I did the music for Wonder Woman Vanaja and Superman Sadanandhan, which was released on Wednesday. Music director Ronnie Raphael is also working on some of the films. We are trying to work with a small team to ensure a common musical thread,” says Rahul.
Superman Sadanandhan features film director Johny Antony playing Sadhanandhan, an NRI who has come to Kerala for his niece’s wedding. However, instead of attending the wedding, he quarantines himself at home as a responsible citizen, thus becoming a ‘superman’.
 




 
Johny, who has made a name for himself as an actor, especially after his effortless act as a psychiatrist in Varane Avashyamundu, says he was happy to be part of such a campaign. “I enjoyed the theme and working with the team led by ad filmmaker Kumar Neelakantan. My only difficulty was that it was almost a solo act. So I found it a little embarrassing to do it all on my own. But these are situations all of us have faced and I managed to do it. However, I am relieved that the response has been good,” he says.
All the films were shot in Kochi and none of the actors or technicians took any remuneration for their efforts. “Each film has a common man who rises to the challenge to break the chain, thus becoming a superhero and every film touches on different aspects of social distancing and efforts to battle the pandemic,” explains Unnikrishnan.
Wonder Woman Sara, starring Rajisha Vijayan and Kunjan; Superhero Suni with Vishnu Unnikrishnan; Wonder Woman Vidya featuring Anna Reshma Rajan; Superman Shaji starring Siddartha Siva; Superman Subair with Sohan Seenulal and Superhero Anthony with Da Vinci Suresh will be released in the coming days.",movies

Team ‘RRR’ does social-distancing in style

The Telugu title is Roudram Ranam Rudhiram and the motion poster shows Ram Charan as an embodiment of the element fire and NTR as water. What happens when these two forces with immense energy come together?






 
RRR is a fictional tale involving freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem. At a press conference last year, Rajamouli had stated that the inspiration came from Motorcycle Diaries. He had stated that RRR will be set in 1920s pre-independent India, and Ram Charan will play the younger version of Alluri Sitarama Raju while NTR will play the younger Komaram Bheem.
Prior to revealing the title, Rajamouli had tweeted on Wednesday: “It’s a time of global crisis. We wanted to do our bit in lifting up everyone’s spirits. We are launching the long overdue title logo with motion poster.” He added that his team members are working from their respective homes and urged everyone to stay home during lockdown.
In English, captioning RRR as Rise Roar Revolt, the team confirmed that the film’s release date is January 8, 2021.
RRR also stars Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Alison Doody, Ray Stevenson among others. Produced by DVV Danayya, the crew includes a few key Baahubali members — story by Rajamouli’s father Vijayendra Prasad, dialogue writer Sai Madhav Burra, cinematographer K K Senthil Kumar, production designer Sabu Cyril and music composer M M Keeravaani.

SEBI writes to States on broking staff safety,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sebi-writes-to-states-on-broking-staff-safety/article31166946.ece,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has written to all State governments to ensure the safety of individuals working with capital market intermediaries to enable the smooth functioning of the markets. 
This comes on the back of a huge clamour for closure of capital markets with both, equity and commodity market participants, knocking at the regulator’s doors to seek a review of its decision to keep the markets open even as the whole country has gone into lockdown mode. 
“[The] stock market operations are to be in line with the orders of Government of India and State governments and SEBI notifications. Today, SEBI has written to chief secretaries/administrators of all states/UTs, requesting them to facilitate the functioning and movement of personnel of entities notified by SEBI for the smooth operation of the capital markets,” said SEBI in a statement issued on Wednesday.
Incidentally, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, on March 23, wrote a similar letter to all States to ensure that essential staffers of capital market intermediaries were allowed to commute amid the lockdown.
Meanwhile, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI), the umbrella body representing around 900 brokers, has said that local authorities on the ground have made it difficult for the staff to reach office with some staffers even complaining about manhandling by the police. 
 “We would like to point out that the law enforcement agencies at grassroots level are still not sensitised about the SEBI directive. This has led to several instances of manhandling the staff of broking firms while travelling to offices,” said Vijay Bhushan, president, ANMI.
“We have received several requests to suspend broking services on humanitarian grounds considering the growing instances of spreading COVID-19,” said Mr. Bhushan.
Commodity market participants also feel that if market closure is not an option then, at least, trading hours should be curtailed as the commodity derivatives segment has much longer trading hours compared with equity.
“These are exceptional and unprecedented circumstances when the regulators need to take into consideration the safety of the people engaged in these services and their families and take bold and unprecedented steps to at least curtail time of market,” said Narinder Wadhwa, president, Commodity Participants Association of India (CPAI).
“In view of the apprehensions expressed by members at large on account of health and safety concerns, ANMI appeals to your good offices to allow a systematic closure till the nation-wide lockdown remains in force,” stated ANMI in a letter sent to SEBI, stock exchanges and depositories on Wednesday.",markets

The 30-share Sensex gained 1,861.75 points, or 6.98%, to close at 28,535.78.
The rally was primarily on the back of massive gains in index heavyweights Reliance Industries, HDFC twins — HDFC and HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.
The broader Nifty ended the day at 8,317.85, up 516.80 points or 6.62%. Incidentally, the India VIX index dipped nearly 8%.
“The recent positive announcements from the U.S. Fed and rising hopes of a stimulus package from the Indian government have lifted sentiments,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president (Research), Religare Broking.
“We expect that volatility would remain high in the near term and any sustainable rally would largely depend upon how effectively we can contain the spread of coronavirus now with a 21-day nationwide lockdown in place,” said Mr. Mishra.

The stars look down: Mango Education’s online star gazing session teaches people about the night sky,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mango-educations-online-star-gazing-session-teaches-people-about-the-night-sky/article31160690.ece,"At a time when most people are looking up in prayer, another group in Coimbatore was watching the sky for a different reason. Last Sunday, they were busy star gazing and studying the night sky through a webinar conducted by Mango Education.
“This was open to all and we did not charge an entry fee,” Obuli Chandran, science educator and co-founder of Mango Education, explains. “By 8.00 pm on Sunday, we had 187 registrations.”
The idea behind this session was two-fold: to give parents and kids a fun way to spend some time together and to teach them to find directions using the night sky. “Often we use the sun’s position in the sky as a reference point,” Obuli says. Since “the sun rises in the east and sets in the west” has been dinned into us, most of us have a rudimentary sense of direction to know where we are facing. But the night sky is a whole new ball game. Even if you don’t have a compass, you can track your route with the help of the stars, says Obuli confidently. 
On Sunday, all participants were on their respective terraces and connected through the Zoom app. Obuli says they chose Zoom “mainly because of the ease of access for the attendees. They just needed the meeting ID and password to join the group.” He also mentions that other features like screen sharing, whiteboard and remote access are very convenient for online education. To identify stars and constellations, “we had asked them to download the GPS-enabled Star Walk app. Point it at the sky and it will tell you what stars and constellations can be seen in your vicinity.” 
Kids Ask App“A learning community driven by the art of questioning,” is how Obuli describes it and explains that, through this app, children will get to interact with scientists from different fields and get their questions answered. There will be a discussion of some scientific topic each day. There will be an annual subscription for this.For more details call 9952243541 or email hello@themango.co 
Everyone managed to see three major constellations: the Orion, the Canis Major and the Ursa Major. “Orion is also known as the Hunter. Ursa Major is known as Saptarishi in India and also as Big Dipper. The Canis Major contains Sirius, also known as the Dog Star. It is the brightest star in the sky because it is quite close to the Sun,” Obuli offers extra information, adding that Orion and Canis Major will be visible for the next few months.

Special Arrangement  





The three major requirements for a good night skywatching sessions are clear skies and no light pollution. “It is also better to schedule it closer to new moon days rather than full moon days,” he adds. “Our programme was on a new moon night, so we didn’t have even the light of the moon. I had asked all participants to switch off their terrace or house lights so that they got a clearer unimpeded view.” And one of the reasons he wanted parents to be around; he didn’t want children running around on the terrace without lights.
Learn via WhatsAppAnother initiative is Mango Science Radio, which will offer short audio bytes via WhatsApp. Arumugham Sankaran, co-founder of Mango Education, says that they felt that the medium could be used as a means of learning “instead of just reading forwards and fake news.” And they wanted to keep it simple, “so we ended up using WhatsApp audio message.” The subscription for this is free and every evening, subscribers will receive short stories on history of science and learn concepts taught by passionate educators and scientists. To subscribe, type “TUNE ME INTO MANGO SCIENCE RADIO” and WhatsApp it to 9952243541. For more details call the saame number
Those who had doubts sent in their questions in the chat box and these were answered instantly, making the session an interactive one. Asked what they felt about the session Ranjani Gangadharan mentioned that her son “thoroughly enjoyed it”, while 11-year-old Siddharth wanted “many more sessions like this”.",science

Nothing much can get done until those dates are worked out by the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese government and Tokyo organisers.
“We must decide this soon, otherwise it will be hard to decide on other things to follow,” Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee, told his senior directors on Thursday.
Two days after the unprecedented postponement was announced, the “Tokyo 2020 New Launch Task Force” must put the Games back together.
Muto and the president of the organising committee, Yoshiro Mori, each gave pep speeches. Mori, an 82-year-old former Japanese Prime Minister, drew on war memories from his youth to summon the resolve to redo in a few months what was seven years in the planning.
Muto ran off a condensed string of issues to be resolved: ticketing, security, venues, merchandise, accommodation, the Athletes Village, transportation and lining up unpaid volunteers. 
He added he was looking at “thousands of contracts” and the interests of broadcasters, sponsors, the IOC, world sports federations and national Olympic committees.
“I didn’t imagine at all we’d be tested to this degree,” he acknowledged. 
He also voiced another reality. “Additional expenses are going to be quite massive we assume,” Muto said.

This would go on top of an official budget of $12.6 billion.

In Sydney, in 2000, Federer made the semifinals in singles but he still remembers Australia fondly as the place where he first started his romance with Mirka Vavrinec, who is now his wife.
“Overall, it was probably the most unbelievable Olympics I ever had,” said Federer, who was also Switzerland’s flag-bearer in Beijing and in Athens in 2004 where he had exited in the second round.
SERENA WILLIAMS: The US great will be 40 in September next year although her desire to play in Tokyo might not be as pressing as that of Federer’s. Serena already has four gold medals — singles at London in 2012 and women’s doubles with sister Venus in 2000, 2008 and 2012. 
The sisters lost their opening round match in Rio in 2016 while Serena’s gold medal defence in singles ended at the hands of Elina Svitolina in the third round.
TIGER WOODS: Woods, who will turn 45 this December, would have struggled to make the US team for the Games had it had remained in its 2020 slot. He is currently only the sixth-ranked American, with just the top four guaranteed to make the squad.
Woods, the winner of 15 Majors, has been fighting a recurrence of a back injury so at least the delay to 2021 for the Olympics gives him renewed hope of a golden swansong. Organisers would be desperate for Woods to play after he missed the return of golf at the 2016 Games in Rio due to injury.
LIN DAN: The colourful and controversial Chinese badminton superstar will be 37 by the time the next Games roll around. Lin already has gold from Beijing and London to add to his five World titles. 
However, there is a hint of unfinished business for Lin who was defeated in the bronze medal match in Rio in 2016 by great rival Lee Chong Wei, the man he had beaten in two finals.
ALLYSON FELIX: The only female track and field athlete in history to win six Olympic gold medals, Felix had spent the last two years preparing for a golden farewell at the Tokyo Olympics.
Felix, who turns 35 at the end of this year, will be racing against Father Time as she attempts to improve her tally in what will be her fifth consecutive Olympics appearance. The American star can take comfort from the fact she is by no means the oldest woman to chase Olympic glory in sprint events. Merlene Ottey was 40 when she anchored Jamaica’s 4x100m relay team to a bronze medal in 2000.",other sports
Olympics 2021: India set to retain foreign coaches ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympics-2021-india-set-to-retain-foreign-coaches/article31172611.ece," Their stints were supposed to wind up after the Olympics this year but with the mega-event postponed till 2021, several foreign coaches training Indian athletes for Tokyo are set for extended tenures as they seek to complete their “unfinished mission”.

 Whether it’s women’s wrestling coach Andrew Cook, shooting’s celebrated pistol coach Pavel Smirnov, boxing’s duo of Santiago Nieva and Rafaelle Bergamasco or athletics’ high performance director Volker Herrmann, their contracts were to end after the Games.
 But the Games will have to wait for a year thanks to the raging COVID-19 pandemic. This translates into contract extension for India’s coaching imports in the “interest of continuity” and the process will be initiated once the national lockdown to combat the pandemic comes to an end.
 “It’s the Sports Authority of India (SAI) which pays their salaries. We have to speak with them...They also know that these are extraordinary circumstances, so I don’t see any problem in getting extension in contracts for them,” Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Secretary VN Prasood told PTI.
 The WFI had roped in American Cook for women wrestlers and Georgian Temo Gabishvili for the Greco-Roman grapplers. Recently, the WFI had also taken the celebrated Bajrang Punia’s Georgian coach Shako Bentinidis under its wings.
 “The situation will be clear once this 21-day lockdown is complete,” Prasood added.
 The national governing body of shooting — NRAI — also does not foresee any problem in getting longer contracts for Smirnov and rifle coach Oleg Mikahilov. Their tenures were to end in August this year as the Olympics was scheduled from July 24 to August 9.
 “There will be a review for sure. Naturally we will likely approach them (SAI) to give our coaches extension of their contracts. The president (Raninder Singh) will decide once the office opens but we would like them to continue with us,” an NRAI official said. 
 But are the coaches ready to accept these extended tenures? At least, those involved with boxing are. 
 “My contract with SAI runs out in December but I will stay back if offered an extension. It’s taken a lot to get the results and can’t really leave without crossing the line, can we? I will accept a longer contract if offered,” said Nieva. 
 The Boxing Federation of India said it is happy to oblige given that an unprecedented nine pugilists made the Tokyo cut in the very first qualifier tournament. 
 “All foreign coaches associated with us will get extensions. In fact, the Ministry wanted us to have them till the 2024 Games for continuity. So, it won’t be a problem but we have to wait for the lockdown to end,” said a top BFI officials. 
 “The paperwork will have to wait a few weeks.” 
 Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla had a simple response to PTI’s query on extension for Volker.
 “It is common sense.” 
 A step ahead of the rest in this case, Hockey India has already put in a plea to SAI, seeking longer tenures for men’s coach Graham Reid and women’s in-charge Sjoerd Marijne 
 “We have sent a request to SAI to extend the contracts of all support staff associated with both men’s and women’s teams, including foreign coaches,” Hockey India CEO Elena Norman said. 
 “We have spoken to all the foreign coaches and they have assured us that they are all committed to their jobs till Tokyo Games,” she added. 
 So far, close to 80 Indian athletes have qualified for the Games, the new dates for which are not yet out.
 The strength of India’s contingent for Tokyo is expected to increase once the qualifiers are restarted.
 But that will take a while to be figured out as the world battles travel restrictions and lockdowns in wake of the pandemic, which has led to more than 21,000 deaths till now. ",other sports

Sindhu, who claimed a silver at the Rio Olympics, is assured of a spot at the Tokyo Games based on her rankings but has to wait for next year to compete in her second Olympics.

Indian shuttlers for freeze in rankings,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-shuttlers-for-freeze-in-rankings/article31167402.ece,"The Olympics postponement brought some relief but Indian shuttlers, including B. Sai Praneeth, are still wondering why the Badminton World Federation (BWF) is yet to freeze the rankings and sought clarity about the qualification process of the Tokyo Games.
The BWF had suspended all HSBC BWF World Tour events post the All England Championships due to the COVID-19 pandemic and there were calls for the extension of the Olympic qualification period which falls on April 28.
But now with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) postponing the Olympics to next year, shuttlers believe its time BWF immediately freezes the ranking.
“Our points are getting deducted even though the tournaments were postponed by BWF due to the coronavirus. Swiss Open got postponed but my points got deducted. 
“So like this, if they keep slashing the points for all the qualifiers which were postponed, I don’t know what will happen,” Praneeth said. 
“BWF should at least freeze the rankings, later they can decide about the qualification depending on the the dates of Olympics but as of now there is no clarity.” 
Praneeth, who was set to make his Olympic debut, said he is not sure about his participation as he will have to fight again for points.
“If Olympics would have happened in July, I would have been sure about my qualification but since it is now a year to go, so the process will again be on and I will have to fight for ranking points again. 
“It is not easy to maintain that ranking. I can’t say what will happen after one year,” he said. ",other sports
Indian TT players get more time ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-tt-players-get-more-time/article31166802.ece,"The postponement of Tokyo Olympics to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic has given India’s table tennis squad more time to prepare and given the current scenario, the sport’s governing body TTFI is looking to fill the head coach’s position locally rather than hiring a foreign coach.
The head coach position has been lying vacant since the 2018 Asian Games due to multiple factors. 
The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) had tried to rope in Canadian Dejan Papic last year, but things did not work out as the latter decided to undergo a knee surgery when he was expected to join the squad.
“We can only look at an Indian coach now. There is no activity at the moment, but when things get better, I doubt a foreign coach would like to come here considering the global situation (due to coronavirus),” TTFI secretary-general M.P. Singh said. 
Former national champions Soumyadeep Roy and Arup Basak have been working with the men’s and women’s teams respectively for more than a year.
With the entire world sporting scene coming to a standstill due to the pandemic, there is lack of clarity over the Olympic qualification events. 
The Asian qualifier was supposed to take place next month but world body ITTF has suspended all activity until the end of April.
“We are waiting for the ITTF to give us more details about the future. The Olympic qualifying events need to be rescheduled and may be fresh rankings will have to be considered for qualification,” Singh added.
India’s highest-ranked player G. Sathiyan, who is in line to qualify alongside veteran Sharath Kamal, said it is still too early to talk about the game.
“Decision can only be made after the world is able to contain the virus. Indian coach is an option but will have to discuss with TTFI and SAI when the time comes and take a call,” said Sathiyan. 
Among the women, Manika Batra has the best chance of making the Olympics cut. ",other sports

There’s also the creative dilemma you have to deal with. Gautham Menon has directed some of the most talented actors around, but it took a couple of creators to perceive an effortless performer lurking in him. Even as he’s gently being pulled out of a financial quagmire and his fans are awaiting ‘Dhruva Natchathiram’, he’s earned admirers for his performances in ‘Trance’ and ‘Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal’.
Then again, most cinema fans are waiting with bated breath for an official announcement that he will be directing Kamal again in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu 2’. Trusted sources tell me Kamal is kicked about the plot and has given the nod. Meanwhile Gautham can enjoy a paid holiday in front of the camera, that seems to like him in front too.
(Laughs) What a way to start. Not in any of the films I’ve directed so far. I’ve never felt I have to go and do it. Just to enhance I have dubbed for a few of the characters. I’ve never felt frustrated with anyone from Madhavan to Ajith, Surya, Simbu or Kamal sir. You have to work around them of course, like Vikram seems to not be listening to while you talk to him. Maybe it’s the eagerness to get things going. It’s not arrogance. It’s his way of saying I know what you want.
The first take may be different from what you have in mind, but you can tell him. It’s just that recently I’ve been meeting people like Anwar Rasheed and Fahadh Fasil who suggested acting and it’s just a window and I’m trying to poke my head in. I don’t want to let go of the opportunity. I’ve had a couple of really good experiences and a bad one where I had to walk out.
I’ve asked this of everyone who’s approached me, even Desingh (Kannum Kannum...). I have been offered full length roles before that film, but I’ve refused. I asked Anwar too. He said he liked the way I handle my interviews and the way I spoke. Some people see a negative streak in me.
Oh my God, yes. I did interview Mani sir for a series and I know how I felt. He did make me feel comfortable, but…
Correct. With Desingh he was always talking about ‘Kaakha Kaakha’ and ‘Vaaranam Aayiram’ and told me about the scripts he had. He was more like a fanboy who was anxious about my opinion. I kept assuring him he was doing fine. I told him I was there to do his bidding. With Anwar who’s a contemporary, there was a lot of learning from my side too. I’ve admired his work. He was never intimidated. I liked the way they worked with live sound.
No, not till I felt it would be outside my comfort zone as an actor. There was the last scene in ‘Trance’ where I was to be killed. It was a close-up and I had to simulate expressions. It was difficult and I did suggest an alternative way. In Desingh’s film I had to step out of a car and confront goons chasing me. They’d planned a fight sequence with me in a dhoti. That’s the introduction you write for a ‘mass’ hero. He kept insisting but I gave him an alternative and he wrote the scene. There was a fight planned at the airport too, but I gently told him that as a top cop I shouldn’t indulge in fisticuffs. He was kind enough to agree.
That’s blasphemy if you ask me you know. I am a huge fanboy who wrote that scene even though the rest of the film was not like that, just for the audience to celebrate this man. You step aside from the filmmaker you are momentarily. That was a fan’s tribute. ‘Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu 2’ also has a similar opening scene and I’m really looking forward to shoot that.
You’re absolutely right, you have to lose your inhibitions, not be conscious of the surrounding, know where to look and the close-ups are not easy. I completely admire actors who let go and are themselves in front of the camera. I’m basically conscious even while having a selfie taken. People ask why I look glum. So being oneself is not easy too in front of the camera.
No, but I’ve recently asked a couple of others to write something full- fledged for me within my comfort zone. I don’t mind characters with negative shades.
I don’t look at it that way. It was towards the twilight of their career. It’s like a shift. I want to make films for as long as possible as well as act in the odd one too.
Oh absolutely. I’ve been a big admirer of Fahadh even before I met him. On the set, he internalizes for 20 minutes before the shot. He goes quiet no matter what the scene is. That mood is transmitted to the rest. He draws you into the mood without instructions. I have material for him. He’s promised he’ll approach me and we’ll shoot. That’s the way he works. I’ll wait for him.







I think I’ll take that as a compliment.
We’re keeping it a bit quiet. I have to narrate one more time to Kamal sir and am hoping things fall in place by April.",entertainment
Pioneering chef Floyd Cardoz inspired many to experiment with cuisine,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/pioneering-chef-floyd-cardoz-inspired-many-to-experiment-with-cuisine/article31168393.ece,"He sat at an outer table, quiet and unobtrusive, eating dinner with his two companions at the then newly launched Farzi Café in Gurgaon one monsoon evening in 2014, when someone pointed him out to me as the chef behind Tabla, New York.
Till then, I had known Floyd Cardoz by reputation alone. To those of us who wrote on Indian gastronomy, he was a well-known name — the Mumbai-raised, Goan chef who had put Indian food on the map in the U.S., marrying regional flavours to local produce to come up with contemporary plates.
Chef Cardoz died of COVID-19 on Wednesday. He had tested positive on March 18 and was being treated at Mountainside Medical Centre, New Jersey. He was 59.
A chef par excellence, Cardoz was the co-founder of Hunger Inc, the company that runs restaurants such as The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro.
The loss is unbearable, stunning all of us in the world of food in India, a community that for all its squabbles and differences is also closely knit. Just in the beginning of the month, when Cardoz was in Mumbai for the launch of the Bombay Sweet Shop (also by Hunger Inc), he had attended events with much of the restaurant and writing community in attendance. He flew back to New York, and according to his Facebook post admitted himself to a hospital in New Jersey on Mach 18 after feeling feverish.
My abiding memory of Cardoz will be of that monsoon evening in 2014, when Floyd had come back to India, having earned his accolades abroad, on a mission to push the envelope even further. That evening as he and his two dining companions, Yash Bhanage and Sameer Seth, sat at Farzi Café, they had been discussing their plans to start a new restaurant in Mumbai.

Passion project
Bhanage and Seth had been mentored by Cardoz as young hospitality professionals in the U.S. Now, with their guide and father figure in tow, it was fitting that they should plan a passion project meticulously.
A year later, the trio launched The Bombay Canteen and invited me over.
Many of the dishes — devilled eggs flavoured with Goan masala, arbi tuk (colocasia) and kamal kakdi (lotus stem) chips — paid a tribute to Cardoz’s memories of a Bombay he had grown up in. His stories about feema (kheema) pao at the St. Xavier’s College canteen, the crab curry and Goan sausage at home had obviously seeped into the spirit and cooking of the restaurant. As he sat remembering things past, two young men were manning the kitchen, executing his dishes, passing food out through a small service window. Chefs Thomas Zacharias and Hussain Shahzad were being mentored by Cardoz.
The two are leading restaurant chefs in India today; their own dishes define the menus of The Bombay Canteen and its sister outlet O Pedro (that opened in 2017). And their creativity is independent of their mentor’s. But both did start out under the able guidance of Cardoz, a chef and man, whose most remarkable ability may have been not just to cook in inspired ways but to mentor younger creative people. There was a generosity in letting them soar independently, unshackled. It is a testimony to Cardoz’s talent and leadership that all his protégées have carved out creative niches for themselves and are taking his legacy forward.
For all his soft spokenness, Cardoz didn’t mince his words. When I asked him to write a piece for my blog, he wrote with passion and candour as to how the standard of restaurant cooking in India needed to be much higher. Few chefs would have publicly called out low quality in the industry.
His own cooking was strongly rooted in his roots though sometimes, dishes could stop you in your tracks with their ingenuity. The dish I will always remember him for is a red snapper sol kadi ceviche. He had initially conceptualised it for Paowalla, his Soho outing that unfortunately shut. The konkani flavours of sol kadi replacing the acidity of lime, was a stroke of genius. That genius is now lost to the world of gastronomy.

"Photographer Nemai Ghosh, the man who never missed a moment",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/photographer-nemai-ghosh-the-man-who-never-missed-a-moment/article31168317.ece,"For someone best remembered as the visual biographer of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray and a documentarian of the making of his astounding body of work, an interesting aspect about Nemai Ghosh was that he started off as an actor with actor-director Utpal Dutt’s Little Theatre Group in Kolkata.
Arts critic and publisher-editor Samik Bandopadhyay remembers one such play that he acted in: the landmark Angar (1959) about the exploitation of coal miners. It had music by Ravi Shankar and complex sets (Nirmal Guha Ray) and lighting design (Tapas Sen) with an entire sequence of a mine getting submerged under water. “He was an impressive and formidable figure on stage but was never so interested in photography then,” recalls Mr. Bandopadhyay.
Nemai Ghosh passed away in Kolkata on Wednesday. He was 85.
Ghosh’s interest in photography was kindled entirely by chance in 1966 when he found an abandoned camera and started tinkering and playing around with it. Being a great lover of cinema himself, he wanted to shoot the process of filmmaking which is when his path crossed with that of Ray. Initially just “tolerant” of his presence, as he once recalled, Ray discovered Ghosh’s talent by and by to have him become a part of his unit. Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) onwards, he was the still photographer for all of Ray’s works till his last film Agantuk (1991). “The only other parallel I can draw is Raghu Rai’s photographs of Indira Gandhi,” says photographer Chirodeep Chaudhuri of an imagemaker’s consistent collaboration and engagement with a personality.
Ray’s son and filmmaker Sandip Ray remembers meeting him on the sets of Goopi… “He was a part of the family. He was always there, not just on the shoot, but our home as well,” he says.
The magic of his black and white images lay in the specific fleeting instants that they managed to capture, that too without flash, in natural light. “He never missed a moment, captured the right moment,” says Sandip Ray. “His work in theatre gave him a sense of the moment,” says Mr. Bandopadhyay.
Filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh compares his frames to videography. “Each of his photos tells a story to me. Like Jaya Bachchan in Kalighat, teeka on the forehead, prasad in hand, happy… I see many things in the process. It’s instructive and informative about the process of filmmaking itself,” he says.
Mr. Chaudhuri points out the candidness in his frames unlike the “manufactured PR images and ‘behind the scenes’, ‘making of’ balderdash” where the stars are perennially performing or posing.
“There was an endearing quality about his photos. You could see his love for theatre and cinema [reflected in them],” says Mr. Chaudhuri. 
Apart from Ray, Ghosh also chronicled some of Mrinal Sen’s films and he was the still photographer on Mira Nair’s The Namesake. “His portraits of my father were absolutely brilliant,” says Mr. Ray. Sujoy Ghosh remembers him shooting on the sets of his own film Kahaani. “I fell at his feet. It was such an honour that he considered our film,” he says.
Beyond Ray and films, a major part of his work was on the theatre in Bengal and about Kolkata itself. His work was a reference point for Sujoy Ghosh when he went shooting in Kolkata for Kahaani. “It was an amazing inspiration. Every photographer and painter has a [unique] way of looking at places, objects, people which is different from ours,” he says.
Mr. Chaudhuri remembers him showing rare colour photos of Ray when he visited Ghosh at his home couple of years back. “He was so excited going through the folders and files of his work on the computer,” he says. One of Ghosh’s disappointments, according to Mr. Chaudhuri, was not being given space by the State government to archive his work. Later, he gave away most of it to the Delhi Art Gallery.
In the latter half, he was passionately documenting painters at work and musicians in performance. According to Mr. Bandopadhyay, Ghosh had clicked some exclusive pictures of the ailing Italian maestro Michelangelo Antonioni, some of them in his hotel room, when the latter had come to Kolkata for the retrospective of his work at the International Film Festival of India in 1994. Impressed with his images, Mr Antonioni, who had taken to painting in his later years, had invited him for his exhibition to Italy. Ghosh took pictures of Antonioni moving around in the exhibition on a wheelchair. Having been witness to and documented the maestro’s painting phase, Ghosh wanted to preserve them in the form of a book. Sadly there were no takers for it in the commercial publishing world.",entertainment
Quarantine tales: How Bengalureans are coping with lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/heres-how-indians-are-coping-with-the-lockdown/article31173874.ece,"At 6.07 pm on a Wednesday, keyboard tunes to Kishore Kumar’s ‘Yeh Shaam Mastaani’ reverberated in a gated community in Bengaluru. The occasion: self-isolation.
It all started as a call for ideas to entertain oneself during self isolation, on the WhatsApp group comprising residents of the apartment complex. Balcony antakshari was a suggestion that amused many. The one who proposed it, explained the concept in tweet-sized instructions: “We just pick a time, get to the balcony and play antaksharifor a bit.” Yet another resident offered for her son to play the keyboard which would be attached to speakers. That sealed it.

And so it was decided: It would be a 20-minute session when people would come to their balconies that look into a common courtyard and croon. A few minutes past 6 pm floated a familiar tune. One of the songs was the apt and relatable number ‘Mere Samne Wali Khidki Mein’ (which translates to, in the window opposite mine). And thus, balcony antakshari turned into a balcony concert. The evening ended with ‘Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna’ (that translates to ‘never say goodbye’).
Next evening, a German lady whose father was an opera singer in Austria, offered to play his CDs from her balcony. And the day after that, a stereo blasted kids’ favorites like ‘Prince Ali’ from Aladdin, ‘Sunflower’ from Spiderman, and ‘We Will Rock You’ by Queen.
Another resident introduced a cocktail she had concocted and christened Corona Cashaya. The creative that left others on the group drooling, had the beverage served on the rocks with a blob of ginger and a whole lemon artistically placed next to it.
She had bottled three of the same and declared them free for grabs. “Will just drop it at your doorstep and leave,” she offered generously. “Important to keep spirits up!” the post ended with a smiley. And thus began the auction on the same WhatsApp group that lasted nine minutes. This left some, who missed the window, enraged. And so, the next batch was promised. 
Then came Sunday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged everyone across the nation to follow Janta Curfew i.e. to remain in their houses during the day as a drill for the future lockdown. And the occupants in my residential complex did everything prescribed which was to do nothing at all. 
Save the usual measures like sanitizers at the gate, recording temperature of anyone who comes from outside, and closing access to common areas of the club-house like gym and pool, as of now, COVID-19 has helped us discover music lovers and mixologists in my community.

Crafting paper homes and building a community of togetherness through the ‘Coveed Project’ ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/coveed-a-project-in-which-people-craft-paper-houses-and-post-pictures-of-them-co-existing-co-living-co-cooking-and-even-co-fighting/article31173060.ece,"This is not a punishment, says social entrepreneur Lakshmi Menon of the 21-day lockdown. “We should not let Covid 19 take over our lives, so let’s make positivity viral.” 
After the Prime Minister ordered a lockdown until April 14, she has created Coveed, a project in which people craft paper houses and post pictures of their homes, their paper homes and of them co-existing, co-living, co-cooking, and even co-fighting on the website Loka2020.in.
“The house is the safest place on earth. We can travel and live in the fanciest of resorts but the love and safety of a home is irreplaceable. It will be reaffirmed in this period of isolation,” says Lakshmi who has made four models of paper houses.
Lakshmi started the Coveed project on March 21 when 10,000 virtual plots went online for ₹25 each. “We allocate plots and share plot numbers, mark each area with a colour and share a screenshot with the owner. Its all done digitally. Based on that’, they send their art, which will be displayed on their plot and on the bigger Loka canvas,” says Lakshmi. 
So far she has sold 6,044 plots in three days. With the money, they bought and distributed hand sanitisers to autorickshaw drivers, KSRTC bus drivers and street vendors. “They had bought a bottle for their homes but could not afford one on themselves,” says Kochi-based Lakshmi, who runs Pure Living, a social organisation, associated with SHOHM (Social Health One Health Movement) Trust. Lakshmi is also one of the brains behind the Chekutty dolls, which became a symbol of Kerala’s resilience and resurgence after the devastating floods of 2018. 
Once social distancing came into force, Lakshmi asked her volunteers to stop public work and introduced a creative time pass for house-bound folks in an attempt to recognise and reaffirm the strength of co-existence. 
She posted her idea at midnight after the PM’s speech with a demo video. “I selected an easy-to-do video of an origami papercraft house and have already begun receiving photos of paper houses.” She has received photos of houses that reflect people’s interests including some elaborate ones with gardens, fences and lawns.
After the Kerala Chief Minister’s declaration that nobody will go hungry during the lockdown period, Lakshmi added another dimension to the Coveed idea. “The measure of a Coveed is 18 x 6 cms. A rectangular paper of this area can hold 1/3 cup of rice or grain. In 21 days this amount will be quite substantial. Let people appreciate the joy of living inside the home,” says Lakshmi adding that the grains could be donated to an orphanage or old age home after the lockdown is lifted. “We are building a real community of togetherness, from the heart of our homes.”

Birdwatchers see rise in bird sightings during COVID-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/and-the-birds-fly-free/article31172534.ece,"‘Cockarakooo’: I wake up to this call every morning these days. No, I do not live in a village by the fields. I am in an extremely urban setup. Which is why I cannot explain in words my joy when I am actually woken up by a rooster. There’s an empty strip of land near my apartment, which is home to hens, roosters, and cows. They’ve always been there. But now that everyone is home due to the 21-day lockdown and noise levels are low, I can hear them clearly. In fact, I can discern around eight different birdcalls early in the day. Are there more birds in my neighbourhood these days or am I paying more attention to them?
“Both,” laughs Coimbatore birder K Mohan Raj. “Noise pollution is minimal and as a result, there is more bird movement even in urban areas.” He mentions how a bulbul is building a nest in the verandah of his home in Kanuvai, Coimbatore. “This bird is quite rare to be spotted in the city,” he adds. Mohan says now is the best time to appreciate the natural world around us. “Birds seem to be happily calling out to each other from long distances.” Go to your backyard, balcony, terrace, look out your window. “There’s so much to see; birding makes one happy, a much-needed thing at the moment,” he says.

Mohan says that one can spot at least 10 bird species from urban homes that have some green cover. These include the house sparrow whose falling numbers have been worrying experts; tailor bird, sunbird, Asian koel; the white-throated kingfisher can be spotted too, and are commonly seen around waterbodies. Mohan points out that those with a keen eye can see the booted warbler, a migratory species. March being the flowering season for plenty of trees such as sakkarai pazham (muntingia), flowerpeckers flock them to feed on the sweet berries. Golden oriole and barbets head to peepul and banyan trees to feed on their fruit.
“This is among the best seasons for Nature watch,” Mohan explains. “Neem trees have flowered, bees buzz about. In my neighbourhood, I even spotted the gorgeous paradise flycatcher.” At night, keep your ears pricked for calls of the francolin. “Owls come out, and you can also see bats swooping down to eat mosquitoes.”







Some people, such as P Jeganathan, a scientist with Nature Conservation Foundation, find birding something as necessary as their daily yoga or meditation sessions. “I do it for 15 minutes every day, no matter where I am,” he says. He is now in Tirupur and continues to do so from home, and documents the species spotted on the eBird portal.
“The birds are like my neighbours now,” he says. “I have learned their behaviours well over these days.” Jeganathan also does “season watch”, which is essentially keeping track of the trees in his surroundings; note which of them are flowering, and what birds each trees attract. “Neem, for instance, attracts coppersmith barbets when it flowers. I even heard the Blyth’s reed warbler, a migrant bird from the northern hemisphere. Its call is distinct, and I was able to hear it since there was no other noise around.” Jeganathan also points out some inexplicable phenomena due to the lockdown. “I see a lot of crows milling around…I don’t know why.”

“Usually in March, I’m walking around the palash trees and other flowering trees. This year, I am stuck at home, with just one flowering neem tree in view,” says Chennai-based naturalist Yuvan M. Fortunately for Yuvan, everyone else is stuck at home as well, which means even the shier birds are coming out to frolic. “The other day, on the road before my house, I saw a pair of skulky crow pheasants foraging freely along the entire length of the road divider. Usually, these birds just hide in the bushes.” He also saw a barn owl near his apartment for the very first time.
Others reaping the benefit of absentee humans, include songbirds. “They usually need very quiet surroundings before they come out and sing. In the past few days, I have been seeing as well as hearing pied wagtails and pied bushchats nearby,” he says, adding, “I even saw a group of about 200 starlings from my balcony, which I haven’t seen before. They did a mild murmur here, even though there are very few flowering trees nearby and it is almost time for them to fly back to Europe.” Maybe the peace and calm we left behind is encouraging them to stay back.
Suhel Quader, a birder from Bengaluru, decided to study the effects of low noise levels on birds during Sunday’s curfew. “It was my 12-year-old daughter’s idea, actually,” he says. “Using an app, we recorded noise levels and also kept track of the number of birds.” They did so on Saturday and Sunday, from 7 am to 7 pm, and interestingly, they found that more birds were audible on the day of curfew. Suhel continues this exercise from his home. “Birders from several other cities and villages across India are doing this,” he says, adding that they are now brainstorming on the approach to be taken and what to do with the information at hand.
Birding can be therapeutic. Jeganathan adds that there are studies that show that the exercise can have a “healing effect on people with depression.” “There are plenty of resources online to help too,” he points out. Meanwhile, I can hear a ‘keekee’ outside my balcony as I type this. Excuse me while I step out to see who that is.
News from the insect worldNow is the time to say hi to our creepy-crawly friends. Many small creatures are waiting to be discovered: insects, spiders, lizards, earthworms are a few common ones. Insects by far are the greatest in variety. At home, depending on the number of bushes and trees around, you can quite easily spot the grasshopper, geometridae moth, owl moth, leaf-roller beetle, weevil, paper wasp, honeybee, the occasional butterfly, hoverfly, long-legged fly, tile fly, and the troublesome mosquito and house fly.Apart from these you can look out for the garden lizard, house lizard, millipede, garden slug and snail. Among spiders, you can spot the bold jumping spider, the messy daddy-long-legs spider, the discrete lynx spider, the secret thomisid spider, the beautiful web-spinner spiders like argiope, neoscona and spiky orb.— Naturalist ‘Poochi’ Venkat",society
My first ever lockdown shopping venture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/grocery-shopping-on-the-first-day-of-the-21-day-national-lockdown-due-to-corona-pandemic/article31171380.ece,"
My mother called me early in the morning on Wednesday, the first day of the 21-day national lockdown. She demanded to know what groceries I had in my kitchen. I listed out the contents of my kitchen shelf and she was worried. “That won’t be enough for you to survive for three weeks!” Her questions were many and I could not quite calm her down. I tried to tell her that the grocery stores would function, but she refused to be appeased and insisted I go out and see what I could buy. She followed up that phone call with a list of items — pulses, potato, coconut, bread, eggs, rice and oil.
Fearing my mom more than the lockdown, I stepped out armed with my cloth bag and hand sanitizer. It was the first time in days and I took a deep breath, sent up a prayer and started my scooter. What would it be like? Will the police stop me? Perhaps not. My destination was a local departmental store. The roads were empty and the salons, ice cream parlours, bakery, and textile stores were closed. I did not spot any policeman on the road thankfully. The shutters of the departmental store were half-closed. I checked with the man in charge if there were any pulses. The store had run out of it and the stock that was supposed to arrive had not reached yet. “Come back tomorrow,” he told me.
Disappointed, I decided to head back home. On my way, I noticed that the medical stores and the milk booths were open. I also spotted a small grocery store that was functioning. There were helpful markings made of kolam podi to indicate where customers should stand. They were a metre apart. I got the first spot! “This is for everyone's safety. We will be open every day. You don’t have to worry,” the shopkeeper assured me as he handed me the items. I got back home, called my mother and set her mind at rest by WhatsApping her images of my supplies. I feel better too because now I am sure the essentials will be available to me through the lockdown. ",society
When whole families work from home in India,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-are-people-who-are-usually-at-home-coping-with-the-influx-of-people/article31171227.ece,"
“Leftovers are not enough any more!” A wailing emoji accompanies this on WhatsApp. It is nearing lunchtime and Chitra Andrade has just realised that the remains of last night’s dinner (which she normally has for lunch) are not going to cut it because the three men in her life, her husband and two strapping sons are home and hungry.
It is not very different at the home of Priya Narasimhan who says she has been a homemaker since the age of 24. The 53-year-old from Mumbai, says shes been forced into the Superwoman cape. “My day routinely begins at 4.45 am. We are six of us at home. But usually, by 8.00 am most have left home for office, college, and school. After this, time is my own to do as I will. Not any more,” she sighs. “My dear husband who is now working from home bathes, has breakfast, takes his tab and phone and disappears upstairs.” She does cherish that half hour they are together at lunch as a family, but says, “ After lunch he works from home again till 8.00 pm, then comes down declaring, aaj ka office ho gaya (done for the day). At 5.00 pm sharp, just like he does at office, he gets his cup of hot filter coffee.”
Chitra grumbles, “Nothing has changed for them. Each of them is in his room working or on online classes. I have no access to any of the rooms except the living room and the kitchen! Have you tried restricting your mixer use to the time they are not on a phone call? I am the one who is displaced.” For now, Chitra has found the dubious silver lining: “There is less washing as everyone is in their home clothes.” 
Life lessonsMom of two girls and a school teacher Chitra R says she and her daughters have learnt from the lockdown, especially with school closing down. She says...Life is unhurried.There are moments of fear of the unknown, but we acknowledge it and have learnt to not condemn it or discount it either.We are learning to be aware and more mindful of our resources and plan better.Family time is encouraging more conversations and teaching us to consider and respect each other’s opinions and emotions. We are aware of what is happening outside and we are able to better respond to it from within.
For 51-year-old software professional Trivikram Prasad who works from his Bengaluru home, as a routine, says things are ‘interesting’ now that his wife and twin daughters are with him too. “Vaishnavi (his wife) and I compete for the office room. But I am happy to retire for a nap,” he says. “Vaishnavi cooks daily now, which is amazing for me and the kids. But I know she misses going out. She gets bored if she does not have office work.” Trivikram is taking online courses, teaching his kids math and physics, and composing songs. “Vaishnavi and I now take the dogs for a walk every night which we never used to, and sometimes the kids too when they are up for it.”
But having them all home makes him feel just that teeny bit restricted. “I feel more accountable for my time now since we’re all cooped up.” And streaming shows has become a challenge as “none of us can agree on what to watch as a family.” But irrelevant conversations and debates abound as there is a lot of free time. “We video called with six other friends around the world and fought over the right to send forwards on WhatsApp and had a discussion on the plus and minuses of gomutra.”
Vaishnavi, who is India Head for an American financial services company, admits it is taking her some time to get used to working from home. “My first week working from home was unstructured and chaotic. I ended up working almost 14 hours and got a back pain for my efforts.” The second week has been kinder, she says. “I reverted to my office routine of workout, shower, dress up and then login in to work.” But she is discovering the joys of cooking for family. “I take the time to try out new recipes (I had a full time cook before),” she says and adds that she has increased her workout time too. But she absolutely loves being with her teenage twins.”They will soon leave for college and these are precious times for us. We have not eaten meals together in many many years and now we do, with my father-in-law joining in too.” But she confesses she does get anxious about the future. Also, “I am a social person, so I miss going out and meeting friends and family.”
The new routine is challenging, admits D Prashanth, a Yoga Instructor, “Kids are definitely feeling hemmed in,” he says. He and his wife Sapna are designing activities for the children so that they do not end up in front of the TV all day. They ensure the kids’ timetable includes household chores, studies, mealtimes, play and TV times too. He is also finding out that bonding is a double-edged sword. There are conflicts of interest and arguments. “But it is all going towards building healthy relationships. I am convinced families will come out stronger and happier after this lockdown.”
Priya is pleasantly surprised that her kids are volunteering with chores and have developed an interest in cooking and house work. “We giggle over WhatsApp jokes and, to my surprise, I find time to nap. There is no rush to meet deadlines.”",society
India lockdown: The 21-point guide to survive 21 days,https://www.thehindu.com/society/india-lockdown-the-21-point-guide-to-survive-21-days/article31170442.ece,"1. Routine rules
It is quite easy to lose track of the days when you are not stepping out (Ask Omar Abdullah, or Andy Dufresne). So before our old enemy ennui sets in, let’s have a daily plan that doesn’t change too much and goals for the coming weeks.
2. Home offices
No matter how comfortable your memory foam mattress is, it cannot be your workspace. Try setting up a corner of your house as a workstation, preferably one that gets enough daylight and ventilation. Keep it clean and organised, and if living with family, make it clear that this is your personal space. 
3. Switching modes
Try and switch on to your work, and then off at the end of the work day. When your work is interspersed throughout the day, it can seem never-ending and frustrating. This applies to people involved in homecare too. 
4. Hey, good looking
Working in ‘home clothes’ may be blissful for the first three days, but after a point those ‘workwear holidays’ can make you feel like you’re not going anywhere -- metaphorically speaking. You will want to look in the mirror and feel good about yourself. Self care, folks!
5. Break take
Repeat after me: Slurping down noodles while alternating between tabs of YouTube and work email does not a break make. Stretch, play with your kids and pets, or talk to a family member. This means a break from the 24/7 news cycle as well. 
6. Plugged in







The World Health Organization said test, test, test. And now we say, video-calls, video-calls, video-calls. Living alone during the time of lockdown can test your mental health. Stay connected with your family members and friends through daily video calls. And let’s stop talking of social distancing, but instead talk of physical distancing but social support. Those in families — ever thought of doing a real life telling of how you met their mother?
7. Alone time
Just because you’re with family doesn’t mean you need to spend every waking with one another. It is okay to zone out and be in your own world for a while. Meditate, if that helps. Mental health support groups like MPower are also holding online counselling sessions. Or step onto the balcony or terrace for a breath of fresh air every morning — you’ll catch some sun and you can start a pranayama regimen.
8. Covid cowork
Some accounts on Instagram, such as @chutneyspheres have been organising work from home together video calls for colleagues and even strangers to take part in. The only condition: no unnecessary chit-chatting. By the end of this lockdown, you might find new friends!
9. Social media live
Going live is becoming super popular on networks like Instagram and Facebook. With the ‘add me to your live’ option, multiple people have taken to cooking or painting together, hosting discussions, playing charades, quizzes and so on. Get creative, find a Live near you, or go Live yourself. It is a nice feeling: to see and be seen. 
10. Gaming sessions
Call of Duty, Dota, FIFA — you finally have time for your multi-player gaming sessions. Done for no longer than an hour, it could be a stress buster. There are also apps such as QuizUp, Psych and Hangouts to have fun while staying connected.

11. Moving on up
Most fitness trainers are migrating online to workout live, so the rest of us can follow. You can also train with your buddies online. No equipment at home? Get creative: lift water cans, step up and down from the sofa, heave backpacks full of books or simply walk about every time you get a phone call.
12. Freshman-21?
But all that working out won’t amount to anything if you don’t stay away from the temptation to snack. Keep your hands away from munch station, and find healthy alternatives here.
13. Skill drill
All those hobbies you meant to pick up but never had the time for? Now you do. Take online courses and teach yourself new skills. That guitar finally won’t be for show.
14. Hello, silence my old friend
For those living alone, if the silence gets too loud, here are playlists you can listen to. Make your own and share it with friends for them to add their song selections. Or simply, shout and sing yourself. 
15. Balcony meetings
Depending on your neighbourhood, you can say hello to each other through your balconies or verandahs. Funny banners, dance music that drifts from one house to another, or even a basic daily acknowledgment of another human being can bring relief.
16. Nature appreciation
Try growing plants in your balcony – for instance, when you buy mint with the roots, plant it and place in the shade. With humans temporarily out of the scene, the earth’s green cover is returning and birds are out again, making this a great time to get out your binoculars. Bonus: aesthetic looking pictures for your Instagram.
17. Content is king
Read books, watch movies and shows, listen to podcasts, scroll through AMAs on Reddit threads, and store all this trivia upstairs for whenever the pub quiz night is held next.
18. Pro cooking
On holidays, prepare elaborate dishes that you never had the time for before. With no option for eating out, make cooking a fun activity for the family and bond over lengthy meals, where everyone partakes of the process too. For a cleaning up plan, each one gets to pick their favourite activity on a different day.
19. Water on
Don’t forget to drink at least eight glasses a day.
20. Future focus
Because this too shall pass. Plan, visualise, and put up a mood board, of all the things you want to do after things settle down.
21. You are not alone
Whenever things get overwhelming, just remember we are all in this together.",society
Vessels from COVID-19 nations to face more curbs,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vessels-from-covid-19-nations-to-face-more-curbs/article31176285.ece,"The Directorate General (DG) of Shipping has instructed all the major and minor ports to comply with additional measures along with mandatory quarantine for those vessels arriving from COVID-19-hit countries.
In a circular, the DG Shipping has issued an updated list of 47 countries with mandatory quarantine and travel ban by the Ministry of Family and Health Welfare. The list includes countries such as China, the U.K. European countries, Arab, West Asian and South East Asian countries. 
A request to this effect was made by the authorities of major and minor ports in the country to ensure seamless movement of essential goods and services so that the national economic activity was not disrupted. 
On its part, Chennai Port Trust (ChPT) has started implementing the rotation system for its employees in administration, transportation, material handling and other departments allowing them to either work in batches or from home. Only skeleton staff is being deployed at the time of arrival of goods either through vessels or by trains.
“We have asked all the employees of the mechanical workshop to work from home. However, they are refrained from moving around and should be available on telephone or electronic means of communication all the time. They should attend office, in case of exigencies,” said P. Raveendran, chairman, ChPT.
“Till date, we have not stopped any vessel from entering our port. The exim business is going on as usual,” he added.
As a precautionary measure, ChPT has asked its employees to furnish the travel history of their family members to contain the spread of COVID-19.
The largest sea port in the South employs about 3,500 people. It has asked the employees who have recently returned from a foreign tour or if they were in contact with those persons who have travelled to foreign countries to furnish details. 
According to the instructions, those who had travelled abroad should be kept in home isolation for 14 days from the date of arrival. Further, it has asked the staff report for duty only when they are totally free of any symptoms of the illness. ",business

In a letter to enterprise and individual (post-paid) customers of Bharti Airtel, Mr. Vittal said, “Over the last few days, we have all been inundated with what is happening all around the world on COVID-19. Clearly, there is a lot that we don’t know and the uncertainty weighs on all of us.’’
Terming telecom an essential service, he said, “We at Airtel provide an essential service, keeping our customers and the country connected. We are doing everything we can to keep our employees, partners and families safe and connected.’’
To improve the overall Internet experience on these days of heavy traffic, he said, the company had taken various steps, including accelerating roll-outs, upgrading quality of service wherever possible and advancing investments to meet additional bandwidth requirements.
""We understand that your network needs would evolve during this difficult time, as you work from home. We have taken several measures to improve your experience.’’
He encouraged all customers to use digital channels to recharge mobile, wi-fi or TV services and avoid store visits.
In terms of operational redundancy, Mr. Vittal said Bharti Airtel has built a full-fledged contingency plan to deal with any event, including, if it comes to it, quarantining any of its critical network operating centres, call centres, etc.
“We have also reviewed contingency plans of all our partners, our managed service providers, tower companies, equipment providers, call centres and software providers to ensure that we are all coordinated and operate as a single unit,’’ he further said in the letter.

 The pandemic has influenced the advertising behaviours of governments, both the Centre’s and States’, as per data made available exclusively to The Hindu by TAM Media Research, a media monitoring, measurement and analytics firm. 
With the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a big surge in the virus-related advertisements. 
For COVID-19-related messages on TV, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare tops the list with 28% share in ad volumes.

Fitch revises outlook on banks’ operating environment mid-point score to negative,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fitch-revises-outlook-on-banks-operating-environment-mid-point-score-to-negative/article31176130.ece,"Fitch Ratings has revised its operating environment mid-point score for Indian banks to ‘bb’ from ‘bb+’, as increasing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to worsen the tough operating environment. 
“The outlook on the operating environment is ‘negative’ due to the uncertainty surrounding the severity and duration of the pandemic, and the associated effects on India’s banks of restrictions on economic activity,” the rating agency said.
Fitch said the 21-day lockdown will affect industrial production and domestic demand, which will exacerbate the economic slowdown of the past few quarters.
Fitch has revised India GDP growth to 5.1% in the financial year ending March 2021 (FY21), from a pre-pandemic forecast of 5.6%, following a growth of 5.0% in FY20. 
The rating agency said recent steps by the Reserve Bank of India so far focussed on shoring up liquidity in the banking system and ensuring currency stability, but there will be additional measures from the authorities to mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
“The banking system remains under-capitalised and saddled with bad loans despite some progress in resolving these issues. We believe [the] recent developments will add to these issues and slow the resolution process. It will further test the underwriting standards of those banks that expanded the fastest in recent years, including the private-sector banks, as the sharp disruption in economic activity will lead to worsening asset quality,” the rating agency added.",business
Petition asks Supreme Court to declare national financial emergency,https://www.thehindu.com/business/petition-asks-supreme-court-to-declare-national-financial-emergency/article31174424.ece,"A petition was digitally filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday for issuing direction to the government to declare national financial emergency under Article 360 of the Constitution in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The petition, filed by the think-tank Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC), represented by Virag Gupta, said the declaration was necessary to safeguard the rule of law in the country. The petition said this is necessary to prevent any arbitrary action by the authorities.
“Almost all the Fundamental Rights such as freedom of movement, most rights under Article 21 and various other fundamental rights have been practically suspended during this lockdown. The general public is not having access to the newspapers, which is happening for the first time after Independence. The closure of courts affects the right to get justice. It is submitted that this requires the imposition of emergency as per the Constitution, and not an order under Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the petition said.
CASC has sought urgent hearing of the petition through video-conferencing.
Government to pay employer, employee’s PF contribution for 3 months
“The petition stated that this is the biggest emergency in independent India and it must be addressed as per constitutional provisions through unified command between Central and State governments. This will be required not only to defeat the war against Coronavirus, but also in recovery of the economy after lockdown is over,” the plea said.
The petition said that even after the announcement of the 21-day lockdown by the Prime Minister on March 24 and subsequent orders issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, different States and police authorities are continuing to take their own action under the Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in the guise of orders issued by the Central government which amounts to “constitutional fraud”.

 On March 21, the Consumer Affairs Ministry had notified MRP for 2-ply and 3-ply ‘surgical’ face masks at ₹8 and ₹10 per piece, respectively. But for 3-ply meltblown face masks, it had said MRP would be at the rate that prevailed as on February 12.
 “We had a meeting with face mask manufacturers. They were facing some challenges because of lack of clarity on MRP front. So, we have decided to fix the MRP of 3-ply meltblown face masks at ₹16 per piece,” Mr. Agarwal told the PTI.

Actor Vijay is social distancing along with Malavika Mohanan and team ‘Master’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-vijay-is-social-distancing-along-with-malavika-mohanan-and-team-master/article31174665.ece,"Actor Vijay’s upcoming film Master, directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, had a private audio launch recently, due to the coronavirus spread, with a hope that the film could release in April as scheduled.
However, with the 21-day lockdown, that looks unlikely at the moment, with the release of the film’s trailer also postponed.
But it does look like the Master team are keeping in touch during this self-isolation period. Master heroine Malavika Mohanan shared a post on Twitter along with a picture of Vijay, composer Anirudh Ravichander and co-producer Jagdish on a group video call, writing, “Problems will come and go..konjam chill panu maapi!

 The 55-year-old actor, who played Monica across the hit NBC sitcom’s ten-season run, told Jimmy Kimmel that she is trying to relive all the wonderful experiences she had during the making of the series.
“I keep getting asked all these questions about ‘Friends’. But I don’t remember even being on the show. I have such a bad memory. I don’t even remember even being on the show. I have such a bad memory. I remember loving obviously everybody there, and having fun, and I remember certain times in my life that I was there. But I don’t remember episodes. I would never pass. I fail every test,” Cox said during Kimmel’s “Quarantine Minilogue” series on YouTube.
Friends, which aired from 1994 to 2004, was a phenomenon and later went on to find cult status with new audiences through TV reruns and Netflix.
 The show also featured Jennifer Aniston as Rachel, Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe, Matt LeBlanc as Joey, Matthew Perry as Chandler and David Schwimmer as Ross.
 During her chat with Kimmel, Cox also talked about the much-anticipated Friends reunion special, set up at HBO Max. The production of the special was recently suspended in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
“We were supposed to do it Monday and Tuesday of this week... We did speak with the producer one time and we had a meeting —except for David Schwimmer, he was in New York —so we were all in the same room which was really fun,” the actor said.",movies

I particularly liked the way the dialogues were written, and of course, it had wonderful casting in the form of Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia and Sean Connery. There’s a beautiful action sequence that pays tribute to Sergei Eisenstein’s editing theory. You’ll be stunned by the camera movements. Every department surprises you. It’s not an arthouse movie, but a completely commercial one — something any common man would relate to.

I keep revisiting Lawrence of Arabia time and again for various reasons. Sometimes, I watch it for David Lean, the filmmaker; sometimes, it’s for Freddie Young, the cinematographer. It’s a special movie because it was my father who made me watch it. I remember watching Lawrence of Arabia on VHS. Those days, it used to come in two parts — the first half in one and the second half in another. I have a bundle of memories attached to it.

The movie received great reviews and was nominated for the Oscars. I watched Knives Out with four of my director friends. The female lead looked like Trisha Krishnan’s doppelganger. It’s such an engaging movie with Daniel Craig leading the front, in an non-action role. I liked the entire construct inside one large family and an arresting drama that unfolds.
I’m a big fan of period movies and am into historical dramas. Vikings is one of my all-time favourites. There can’t be many people who haven’t watched Game of Thrones. But if there’s anyone who hasn’t watched it yet, now is the time. In the sense that you can binge-watch the entire series in 21 days. That is one strong suggestion.

What are Kollywood stars learning this lockdown season?,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/what-are-kollywood-stars-learning-this-lockdown-season/article31173603.ece,"Being grounded is never fun. Normal life is affected, even for celebrities who aren’t quite used to said life. And at a time when we don’t quite know when the concept of normalcy is likely to return, Tamil film personalities have taken up different interests, away from the glare of cameras and arc lights.
Like actor-composer GV Prakash Kumar, who has gone back to video-gaming with a vengeance during the lockdown. “I have no other choice now but to play video games,” says Prakash, whose normal work schedule doesn’t leave him enough time to engage in this childhood passion. “I work out in my house. I have a gym set up here. I’m also watching movies and listening to music,” he adds. When we reached out to him, Prakash was playing Tennis World Tour: Roland-Garros edition on his favourite PS4 console. “I’m also playing Call of Duty: WWII,” he says. When we suggest trying out FIFA, Prakash, who admits to not having played the popular football game, responds: “FIFA is supposed to be good. Maybe, I will give it a shot.”

Besides video games, the composer says that he thought he’d pick up a guitar and learn how to play the instrument during this time, but the severe restrictions placed on movement of people on the streets means that Prakash will have to give it a pass. Wouldn’t a composer be able to teach himself how to play one? He laughs. “Yeah, but without a tutor it will be tough to get the tone and temper right. It only comes with good positioning,” he says, insisting that there is something he won’t even bother trying during lockdown. “Cooking. I used to like watching the Australian MasterChef series. But I’m not good at cooking.”
For director Sam Anton, though, the lockdown has come at a bad time. “I was in discussion for my next film,” he says, adding that the situation has forced him to have script writing sessions over WhatsApp calls. “I’m writing from 10 to 12 in the morning and after 7 pm in the evening.” What does he do in the meantime? Perhaps, this is now time to touch upon his cooking skills.... “Haha, nope!” he says. “My wife does not let me inside the kitchen because I make a mess. I had to walk a mile to get some bread now,” he says. While it is easy getting used to catering food on a film set, Sam says he is trying to eat healthy at least for the period of lockdown. “I’m trying to lose weight,” he says, before pausing to reiterate the word: “TRYING”.

Losing weight is no problem for Vishnu Vishal. The actor, last seen in the smash hit Ratsasan (2018), has been in a fighting fit condition for some time. His workout and fitness regimen videos attract a lot of viewers on his Instagram and Twitter profiles. However, aside of workouts, Vishnu Vishal has been spending time with his parents, trying to keep the positive spirits high about him and the family. “I’m also thinking of trying to learn some cooking,” he admits. So, exactly how bad is he at cooking at the moment, we ask. “Haha, I’m really bad with cooking. But I haven’t started yet [to learn]. As of now, I can cook some yummy eggs and make myself some sandwiches,” he says. Will that be enough to get him over the next 20 days? He laughs. “Mom is there. But I do want to learn a dish or two,” he adds.
Ponniyin Selvan actor Ashwin Kakumanu is trying something a bit different. He is spending time glued in front of his computer, as he attempts to “brush up on using Final Cut Pro X”. With the Mani Ratnam film now standing postponed for a lot longer than expected due to the Coronavirus outbreak, the actor has found time to edit a pilot video he shot last year. “I had shot it as a concept. I was editing it, but got busy with becoming a father and then work.” He also has other plans. “I was going to start learning the guitar,” he says, adding, “The guitar has always looked cool and the sound of it is really romantic. I was supposed to learn playing the guitar for a project that got shelved. My father-in-law used to play it. I figured it would be a nice way to learn... from apps and watching YouTube tutorials.”

I’m exercising a lot, and experimenting with my fitness by learning CrossFit and focussing on my kick workouts. On the other hand, I’ve finally begun to learn to cook as well, starting off with simple recipes. I noticed a lot of people posting easy instructions for beginners in the kitchen to follow online, and really felt that I should take it up. It’s been surreal for me, as this lockdown feels almost exactly like my time in the Bigg Boss house! Sealed inside the house, with nobody but your family for company, and you cook, clean and fend for yourself: the only difference is that, thankfully, we have our gadgets here to be connected to the outside world. I have four films lined up this year, including Ivan Than Uthaman, the shooting of which was completed. We have to wait and see what happens with them; keeping fingers crossed!

I’m using this time to be productive and decided to take up cooking. I’ve started preparing my own dishes. It’s not like I don’t know the basics. But I want to try out something that’s a little more. For instance, I made some curries and had it with rice. I also made bread upma with eggs. I think it’s essential for people to learn the basics of cooking, at least for survival reasons. Cooking is definitely not an easy job. That’s what I’ve realised. Reading books is another thing I’m seriously giving a thought to. In fact, I’m literally forcing myself to take a book and have started reading after a long time. I think this quarantine period is going to change our lives for the better.
Shraddha Srinath, actress







 
I've been surprisingly leading a very disciplined schedule of late. I get a really good night’s sleep now, with no alarm, cause there’s no need to get up early! Then I ensure I work out twice a day: an intense session in the morning and a lighter one in the evening, getting my 10,000 steps in with a walk while maintaining social distancing of course.
I’m also really enjoying helping my mom in the kitchen and marvelling at her make her signature dishes; the plan is to start baking next as I’ve been really inspired by bakers I see on Instagram.  In the evening, my whole family also bonds over movies and old Hindi songs. But my favourite activity during this lockdown is ultimately cleaning! I’ve been vacuuming the house thoroughly every day and it looks beautiful — it’s almost sort of therapeutic in a way — and I’m relishing this downtime.

As singers, we travel a lot, and we use that time for listening to various forms of music. But in those times, we don’t get the space to practise. I’m using this time to practise, practise and practise. When I have recordings, practise becomes difficult because my voice is under a lot of strain... but now, thanks to the free time, I can brush up my vocal skills. I have started revising some old varnams and keerthanams that I learnt when I was younger. I’m learning all these in the hope that someday soon, I will get to a stage where I can perform a full-fledged classical performance.

I don’t think I will ever make a documentary but I’m using this time to equip myself with a lot of research material from documentaries. I have a long watchlist of documentaries that have the potential to be turned into a dramatic story... so am ticking them all away now. In the pre-OTT days, accessibility to good quality documentaries was a challenge, but now, it’s just a click away. I feel that these documentaries are like reading books; you get more information in lesser time. I’m currently watching ‘Don’t F**K with the Cats’, a docu on someone killing a cat and how a group of people track him down. I have a huge watchlist from various subjects, mainly crime thrillers and historical subjects.

I’ve started painting again; it’s something I used to enjoy doing earlier and now I have the time to indulge in it. I’ve already posted a couple of my recent works on Instagram. Another interest of mine is yoga: in fact, I’ve always wanted to be a yoga teacher! So every evening, I’m doing a live on Instagram where I demonstrate basic poses — sun salutations — that even beginners can pick up. I’m making this a daily affair, and asking people to practise along with me. On the work front, there are two Telugu films currently stalled due to the lockdown, so here’s hoping things get sorted soon.

My Secret, Terrius, which is a 2018 show available on Netflix in several countries (though not India) predicts the coronavirus outbreak in an episode in its first season. Earlier, Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film Contagion, was also in the news, for having a similar storyline.
The synopsis of the South Korean show reads, “A secret agent who detaches himself from the world after a failed operation tries to unravel the mystery behind a neighbour’s death.”
This may come across as an intriguing murder-mystery, but in the tenth episode of the first season, Netflix users have identified that at 53 mins in, the plot comes to a discussion over the coronavirus, though there is no reference to the current COVD-19 that is causing the pandemic. 
A doctor hands over some documents to another character, telling her, “We must do more research, but it looks like a mutant coronavirus.”
The other character responds: “Corona? Then MERS?”
“MERS, SARS, the common flu. They all fall in the same gene family with the same gene information. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system. During the 2015 MERS epidemic, the mortality rate was over 20 percent,” says the doctor.
“But that’s not serious enough to be used as a weapon. Am I wrong?” asks the other person, to which the doctor states, “Like I said, this is a mutant virus. Someone tweaked it to increase the mortality rate to 90 percent.”
Understandably, after this footage found its way online, social media began trending My Secret, Terrius, and users across the globe began searching for the episode on Netflix. Some (like those in India) were left disappointed, while others added to their conspiracy theories.",movies

M. Saravanan, Producer, AVM Production house
Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, which Visu directed for AVM Productions, was the first Tamil film to get a gold medal at the National Film Award for the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It was destiny which brought us together because it was not planned. After finishing his work in Nallavanukku Nallavan, for which he wrote the screenplay, I gave him a double salary because the film had come out very well and was a huge success. He told me that he would rather make a film under the AVM banner than a double salary. I told him that if he could focus only on the AVM film, we could do it. He came back after some time with stories and I was keen on a family drama, which was his speciality. He did have a story, which I liked. The issue was it had already been made into a film and had failed. I told him that humour was missing and he could introduce it by bringing in the character of a maid servant. Visu returned with a modified script and my choice for the maid was Manorama. Visu now wondered how he could think of the story without that character. The rest, as they say, is history. Samsaram Adhu Minsaram was a silver jubilee hit. We gave him only Rs. 15 lakhs. He was able to finish the film with that money. Initially, no distributor came forward to buy the picture. But those who did eventually, did not regret. It earned them revenue ten times. We have lost a good friend, an excellent writer and fine director.

A tribute to Visu: How Lakshmi was the moral centre of ‘Samsaram Adhu Minsaram’




 

A tribute to Visu: How Lakshmi was the moral centre of ‘Samsaram Adhu Minsaram’

Actor-director Y.Gee. Mahendra
Visu was a simple giant. His association with UAA goes back to 1965-66, when Mouli joined too. We were staging “Kannan Vandhan.” Visu appeared in small roles in our plays, his major role being that of a journalist Meenjur in ‘Flight 172.’ We had spotted his talent and he always said that UAA was his launch-pad. His brothers Rajamani and Kishmu were very supportive and they were a close-knit family. Visu was very fond of my parents Y.G. Parthasarathy and Rajamma. He and Rajamani were YGP's blue-eyed boys. Visu wrote the script “Uravukku Kai Koduppom.” My mother liked it; so did I and agreed to direct it for him. It was with this play that Visu’s Viswa Shanti troupe was inaugurated. The play went on to win many awards and created waves. I directed one more play, “Eswara Allah Tere Naam” and after that he was on his own. He rose steadily as a writer-director, actor and conquered the middle class audience. To our family, however, he was the same Visu. In those days, I was a regular pillion rider on his Jawa motorbike. He never missed any of my plays and always followed it up with frank opinion. He was up to date even with my daughter's plays. Perhaps one of his last outings was the special screening of my movie, Shyama Ragam, a month ago. In spite of his deteriorating health, he attended the show and expressed his appreciation. Also, he gave some positive response to the movie in his TV bytes. To me, he said, “It is a good film. And I like it especially because it is a writer-director subject of which I feel proud.” Sad that I could not meet him after that. But I have such lovely memories of the 1960s and 70s, when Visu, Mouli and myself had a roaring time.








Director Kasturi Raja
I owe my career to him. I did not know anything when I came to Madras in search of livelihood. Cinema was my goal and I was exploring opportunities, when I met Visu. He asked me whether I was familiar with direction, I lied that I was. From his first film Manal Kayiru to Sakalakala Sambanthi, I worked with him. In the process, I learnt several things related to life too. It was to him I went with the cheque, when I was first engaged as a director for a film. Blessing me, he said, “Do not give false promise or hope to anybody. Because falsehoods are common in this field. I haven’t forgotten those words. People, who have stories, approach me for an appointment with my son Dhanush. I tell them that I’m not the right person for this. It may cause heart burn and they may not even believe me but that is the truth. Why mislead someone with false hope? I am proud to say that I learnt everything from my guru, Visu, who was a colossus.
Actor Rekha
I acted in four films under his baton — Mappillai Sir, Vedikai En Vadikai, Varavu Nalla Uravu and Kavalan Avan Kovalan — featuring leading artistes. He was a workaholic and his shooting spot was always serious, even if it was a comedy film. Meticulous in his planning, he hated wastage of any sort. His sharp story sense and the ability to make a tight script were his strengths. Even his dialogue was crisp. Comedy flowed naturally from his pen. I was very young and Tamil was not my mother tongue. So I found it difficult to speak his lines. After a couple of times, he would rewrite the lines on the spot. Such was his power. The Tamil film industry has lost a good director and script writer.
Actor Ananthi
I would always remember him as a person oozing with kindness. If somebody went to him with a problem, he would not rest until he found a solution. If it was beyond him, he would suggest the right person. In 1975-76, I acted in the play, “Easwara Allah Tere Nam,” written by him and directed by Y.Gee. Mahendra. After that, I acted in some ten plays, which he directed. When he started work on Manal Kayiru,” he asked me to dub for the heroine. In fact, he took almost all of his theatre friends with him during his film journey. His growth never affected that equation. On my side, all the milestones in my life happened with his blessings. On location, I once noticed that a boy seemed a little distracted. Some personal issue. Visu and that boy had a long conversation, when shooting was suspended. It was resumed only after some understanding was reached. In a couple of days, I came to know that Visu had sorted out the problem. He never spoke about it. Such was his integrity.
Actor Sivakumar
My homage to my friend:
After director K. Balachander, you were the one, who showed the middle class life in the right perspective on stage and also on cinema. Manal Kayiru and Samsaram Athu Minsaram showed your calibre. Through “Arattai Arangam,” you reached the mass. Young students in the villages got recognition and aid because of this platform. Both your daughters live abroad. You once told me, “If I die, I’ll be lying like an orphan, until they reach my side.” My friend, you were so noble, both were with you when your end came. Farewell my friend, extreme caution necessitated by the deadly Corona prevented me from paying my last respects to you. When will we meet again?
Actor Sachu
I was popular in cinema, more for my roles on the lighter side. I wanted to have a taste of theatre. After all so many stalwarts had come from drama and I wanted to test my prowess in a serious role. Vani Kala Mandir gave me the opportunity and I wanted actor and director Mouli to write a script for us. Mouli was busy and recommended young Visu, then an up-and-coming writer, mostly engaged with UAA. ARS corroborated the idea and Visu wrote a script titled, “Deviyar Iruvar,” which had a double role for me. First half was comedy and the second serious. His dialogue proved what a master he was in the art. So, I was the heroine for his first script. I did not act in his direction but we paired in the film, Vaimaiye Vellum. He often said that he wanted to be like Sachumma. What did he mean by that? He explained: “You are like a pillar to your family, making a sacrifice for their happiness. I want to emulate you.” True to that, he took care of all his brothers. When Krishnamurthy (Kishmu) died, he was shattered. All his heroines were ‘Uma,’ named after his wife, who lent him tremendous support. The Tamil film industry will miss a great dialogue writer and a director and I miss a friend, who was kindness personified.
Actor K.R.Vijaya
Visu liked my style of acting. I acted in three films, which he directed. One of them was Aval Sumangalithan. One with the legend Sivaji Ganesan and another Veedu Manaivi Makkal, which was the debut film of his assistant T.P. Gajendran. A master of the art of writing dialogue, he knew what lines would fetch applause from the audience. His instruction to me regarding Veedu… was to just appear for the shooting! He would take care of my acting. Besides, his screenplay and dialogue would do the work for him. And he did guide me.

Police action series NCIS scored its biggest audience since February 2019 on Tuesday night, attracting some 13.08 million viewers: a 22% increase over its last original broadcast on March 10, CBS said on Wednesday.
The Tuesday night season finale of heart-tugging NBC series This Is Us was the most-watched episode since September 2019 and saw a 21% increase in viewers aged 18-49 over the previous week, NBC said.
Audiences for the big four U.S. television networks — ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC — have been declining in recent years due to fierce competition from streaming, esports and social media.
U.S. movie theaters and Broadway theaters have been shut down for almost two weeks, and multiple U.S. states have ordered the closure of restaurants, bars, theme parks and concert venues in a bid to contain the coronavirus epidemic. There are now more than 60,000 cases in the United States and more than 880 deaths.
Streaming service Netflix Inc was also expected to be a major beneficiary of the stay at home directives. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos told CNN on Sunday that viewing was up but gave no details. Netflix on Wednesday declined to comment on recent viewership.
However multiple shows on traditional television, including ”The Good Doctor” on ABC, “The Masked Singer” on Fox and “Survivor” on CBS are also seeing a surge in viewers, according to ratings data.
Data analytics company Nielsen said in a report last week that Americans are expected to watch as much as 60% more television across all platforms as increasingly restrictive shutdowns are implemented across the United States.
The increases are not just for escapist fare. Sunday's topical news show 60 Minutes reached 10.9 million viewers, its largest audience since December 2019, CBS said.
Cable channel HBO is seeing increases for shows like sci-fi series Westworld and for older fare like teen series Euphoria.
Time spent on the HBO Now streaming service since March 14 was up over 40% from a month prior, while daily binge viewing increased 65% compared with the prior four-week period, according to WarnerMedia. ",movies

"Nimmi, doe-eyed star of the 1950s, passes away at 88",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nimmi-doe-eyed-star-of-the-1950s-passes-away-at-88/article31170158.ece,"Nimmi belonged to an era in Hindi cinema when actresses came with their own distinct adaa (style). Acting was all about quicksilver turn of expressions. A raised brow or the quiver of the lips could say it all. Nimmi was known for graceful presence, doe eyes that were a pool of emotions and a voice layered with gravitas.
One of the leading stars of yesteryears, Nimmi passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday at the age of 88.
She was born Nawab Banoo and it was filmmaker-actor Raj Kapoor who gave her the name Nimmi and introduced her on screen. She met him on the sets of Mehboob Khan’s Andaz, which is when he decided to cast her as the second lead in Barsaat. Her debut performance as a naive shepherdess in love with a reckless city slicker went on to define her persona. She came to be identified for a unique air of melancholy and intensity combined with charm, guilelessness and innocence.
Nimmi straddled genres and had a substantial number of hits (a clutch of them with superstar Dilip Kumar) to her credit but could not quite get her due. Despite successes like Aan, Deedar, Daag, Amar, Kundun, Uran Khatola and Basant Bahar, she didn’t get counted in the top league of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala.
Family friend and music director Madan Mohan’s daughter Sangeeta Gupta, who also acted with her in Bhai Bhai, remembers her as an educated, well-spoken, sensitive and charming person. “She used to live across Madan ji’s music room and used to visit quite often,” she says.
Nimmi had slipped into obscurity after the death of her husband Ali Raza. It was a rare interview in 2013 (Guftagoo with Irfan) on Rajya Sabha TV that the reclusive star revealed lots of unknown facets about her personal and professional life. Like how at the London première of Aan she received four Hollywood film offers, including one from none other than Cecil B. Demille.
Lata Mangeshkar tweeted about working together on many films and remembered her as a well mannered, gracious lady. Actor Rishi Kapoor tweeted: “RIP. Thank you, Nimmi aunty, for all the blessings and love for Bobby on its première release. You were part of the RK family. Barsaat was your first film. Allah aapko jannat naseeb kare. Amen.”
Saira Banu tweeted through Dilip Kumar’s handle: “Dilip Sahab and I are feeling a deep sense of personal loss at the passing away of our beloved Nimmi ji. She was my elder and had always maintained close contacts with Sahab and I through her beautiful, loving, prolific, handwritten personal letters in Urdu. Nimmi ji spent good time with my mother Naseem Banu and through my mother and my husband, I built a bond with her. Such stalwarts are rare. Nimmi ji will be missed. May Allah bless her with Jannat.”
Amongst some of her most memorable songs was Jiya beqarar hai and an apt one for the moment Tum na jaane kis jahaan mein kho gaye.",movies
Crisil cuts growth estimate,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/crisil-cuts-growth-estimate/article31176140.ece,"Rating agency Crisil has cut the country’s GDP growth forecast for the next financial year to 3.5% from 5.2% projected earlier, due to the spread of COVID-19. 
“We have slashed our base-case gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for fiscal 2021 to 3.5% from the 5.2% expected earlier. This assumes two things: a normal monsoon, and the effect of the pandemic subsiding materially, if not wearing out, in the April-June quarter,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
 “The slump in growth will be concentrated in the first half of the next fiscal, while the second half should see a mild recovery,” he said.
According to the rating agency, COVID-19 is now the foremost risk for the world economy with multi-dimensional ramifications because, and unlike the global financial crisis of 2008, it has not only slammed the brakes on economic activity and jeopardised financial stability, but also brought with it enormous human suffering not seen in decades.
 “Since our last forecast of 5.2% GDP growth for fiscal 2021, the scenario has worsened notably. S&P Global has marked global growth down significantly, predicting a likely recession in the U.S. and the Eurozone, and lowering China’s growth to 2.9% from 4.8% with dominant downside risks,” the rating agency said, adding the pandemic in India and the consequent lockdown for 21 days posed a material risk to India’s economic outlook. The impact of social distancing and decline in discretionary spending will aggravate the downturn in the April-June quarter, and the sharp slowdown in key trading-partner economies will hit exports. 
Services, which account for 41% of total exports, have been resilient so far, but a recession in the advanced economies would dampen the prospects for IT-ITeS, tourism and bring down services’ exports growth.
On inflation, Crisil said it may soften in FY21 for three reasons; one, the abnormal surge in food inflation in 2019 has started to correct; two, core inflation will remain moderate with slowing growth; and three, the sharp drop in crude prices will keep fuel inflation soft. 
“With base effect also kicking in, the second half of next fiscal should see a perceptible drop in inflation,” the rating agency said. ",economy

The food grain ration for 80 crore poor people would be doubled for the next three months, supplemented by a kg of local pulses as well, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday.

The Centre would provide ₹50 lakh medical insurance cover for the next three months for about 22 lakh health workers in government hospitals fighting the spread of the virus at personal risk, including ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, medical sanitary workers in government hospitals, paramedics, nurses and doctors.
The Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Yojana had been announced within 36 hours of the lockdown and it would take care of the needs of poor and migrant workers, farmers, women, pensioners, widows and the disabled, said Ms Sitharaman.
“We do not want anyone to remain hungry, so we will be giving enough to take care of their food grain requirement, protein requirement in terms of pulses. On the other hand, they should also not remain without money in hand, so several measures through DBT are being taken so that money reaches them,” she said.

Over the next three months, each person who is covered under the National Food Security Act would get an additional five kg wheat or rice for free, in addition to the 5 kg of subsidised foodgrain already provided through the Public Distribution System (PDS). One kg of pulse a household would also be provided for free, according to regional preferences. This would benefit about 80 crore people, she said.
Cash transfers -- a mix of advances via existing schemes and additional sums -- would also be given to vulnerable groups under the Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Yojana.







 
About 3 crore poor pensioners above 60 years, widows and disabled people would be given ₹1000 in two instalments over the next three months. The 20 crore women holding Jan Dhan Yojana accounts would get ₹500 a month over the next three months as well. The 8.3 crore poor households, which received cooking gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme, would now get free gas cylinders for the same period.

Wages were being hiked under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme, from ₹182 to ₹202 a day. Although the Minister said this would provide an additional ₹2000 a worker, many States have in fact closed down MGNREGA worksites to curb the spread of COVID-19, leaving it unclear how many workers would be able to benefit. 
For land-owning farmers, there is only the promise that the first instalment of ₹2000 due to them under the PM-KISAN income support scheme will be paid promptly in April, the first month of the financial year.

For small companies with 100 employees or less, of whom 90% earn less than ₹15,000 a month, the Centre will bear the cost of both employer and employee contribution (a total of 24%) to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) for the next three months. This will benefit 80 lakh employees, and incentivise 4 lakh establishments.
In a move to provide relief to all 4.8 crore organised sector workers registered under the EPF, the scheme's regulations will also be amended to allow non-refundable advance of 75% of the amount standing to the credit of the member, or 3 months worth of wages, whichever is lower. 
Collateral free loans provided for women self-help groups under the National Rural Livelihood Mission are being doubled to ₹20 lakh, potentially benefiting seven crore households.

The Centre is directing the States to use the ₹31,000 crore sitting with the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Boards to provide support to the 3.5 crore workers registered under the scheme.

Age factor worries Tarundeep Rai,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/age-factor-worries-tarundeep-rai/article31186873.ece,"Following the postponement of the Tokyo Games, 36-year-old archer Tarundeep Rai has only one concern – he is getting older.
Waiting to compete in his third Olympics in his 17-year international career, two-time World championships team silver medallist Tarundeep is assessing the challenges the new scenario may pose for him.
“The postponement is a loss for every athlete. In my case, I am 36 years old. Next year, I will be 37. I am not getting younger, but if I train harder, then I will not lag behind. But, I have to start afresh,” Tarundeep told The Hindu.
Tarundeep, who competed in 2004 Athens and 2012 London Olympics, bagged recurve men’s team silver medals in 2005 Madrid and 2019 Den Bosch World championships. 
The Armyman looked at the brighter side. “We have to take it positively. The archery community may suffer, if we look at the negatives. The good thing is that we have already qualified. The younger generation of the country can also get a chance (as the quota place belongs to the country), and should grab it as they will not get another such opportunity.”
Sharing his ideas about training during the lockdown, Tarundeep said, “Whatever archery-specific exercises are there, one should do that. In this age of internet, everything is available on the phone. One should take advantage of that. When the lockdown ends, then one should be ready to resume shooting.”
Tarundeep, who has not been to his home in Sikkim for about a year now, was part of the national camp at the Army Sports Institute, Pune. Even after the camp was shut down on March 22, he could not go home owing to the lockdown.
In the time of social distancing, Tarundeep, nevertheless, is happy to have stayed connected with his family from a distance. “At least, I am safe here and my family is safe in Sikkim. I am getting a lot of time to speak to my family,” he said.",other sports
Disappointing to see our sincerity questioned: Badminton World Federation ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/disappointing-to-see-our-sincerity-questioned-badminton-world-federation/article31186858.ece,"The Badminton World Federation said it is “disappointing” that some top players questioned its “sincerity and motives” when it continued with the All England Championships despite the rapidly-growing threat of COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to conduct the event came for sharp criticism from the top shuttlers of the world, including Saina Nehwal, who had accused the administrators of placing money above players’ safety.
In an open letter, BWF secretary general Thomas Lund said the decision to go ahead with the All England Championships was made based on the best advice at that time.
“It has been very disappointing to see some members of the badminton community speculate on the sincerity and motives of the BWF in this time of crisis,” Lund wrote. “Our number one concern has always been the health and safety of all of our participants.”
“However, at the same time, we are deeply concerned about the cancellation of tournaments and the flow-on effect this has on elite players and coaches whereby they could now be in a position of temporary unemployment and loss of income.” 
However, Lund said it was tough to take decisions in a “fast-changing landscape” where guidelines were revised on daily basis and the approach of different governments was also not consistent.
“Given the fast-changing landscape unfolding with governments implementing measures in inconsistent ways and with many considerations and speculations within our own community, it has therefore been challenging to meet all global expectations from all of you,” he said.
“Of course, hindsight is a wonderful thing. It was not difficult to argue that “wrong decisions” had been taken in an environment changing on nearly an hourly basis, with further decisions therefore required. 
“This has not only been the case for BWF, but most authorities around the world. However, we maintain that BWF made the best possible decisions at the time and with sincere motives to protect both the health and livelihood of all participants.",other sports

T20 World Cup-winning cricketer Joginder Sharma, Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning boxer Akhil Kumar and Asian Games champion kabaddi player Ajay Thakur have one thing in common. They are all full-time police officers, jobs which they got thanks to their sporting accomplishments.

Joginder and Akhil, both Haryana police officers and good friends, listed the challenges that come with “doing duty” during an unprecedented crisis.
“I have been a DSP since 2007. This is one of a kind challenge for me because of the general fear and I can tell you that I have seen quite a few challenges in my years of service,” said Joginder, the all-rounder who bowled the final over in the triumph against Pakistan in the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa.
The 36-year-old is currently posted in Hisar as the nation observes a 21-day lockdown. 
“Our duty time starts around 6 a.m. and we help those in need of essentials or medical aid and take action against those who try to defy without any good reason,” Joginder said. 
Serving with the Gurugram Police as ACP since September last year is Akhil, the flamboyant bantamweight boxer, whose perilously low guard at the peak of his career became the style statement that many in Indian boxing continue to try and emulate.

“People are generally cooperative and in any case, essential services are being kept open so there is not much panic,” said Akhil, who turned 38 on Friday, a working birthday for him. 
The two-time Olympian and Arjuna awardee has also been pooling money with his colleagues, including another boxer-turned-policeman Jitender Kumar, to buy essential food items and sanitisers for the underprivileged. 
Ajay, an Arjuna awardee and Padma Shri winner, is a DSP in Himachal Pradesh and has been in service since 2017.
The 2014 Asian Games gold-medallist was recently seen patrolling the streets of Bilaspur and has been raising awareness about the health crisis through video messages on his Instagram page. ",other sports

Around 57% of the 11,000 scheduled participants for Tokyo had already made sure of taking part when the IOC pushed the Games back. 
The IOC and 32 international sports federations held a teleconference on Thursday where it was decided to respect the qualification process.
“Thomas Bach (the IOC President) first explained the reasons for the postponement of the Games, then said that the athletes qualified for Tokyo 2020 would automatically be qualified for 2021,” one of the participants in the conference told AFP.
“One of the main subjects was to know when and how to organise the qualifications. 
“In some federations, many sportsmen and sportswomen are not qualified and it takes at least three months for the Olympic Games to organise them.” 
Many Olympic sports, such as boxing, saw the vast majority of their qualifying tournaments either interrupted or cancelled due to the global health situation.",other sports
Today’s cache | How to watch Netflix remotely together and more,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/todays-cache-how-to-watch-netflix-remotely-together-and-more/article31185958.ece,"We’re seeing more strain in the globalised world as the rift between Huawei and US escalates, which may impact the Chinese smartphone maker’s supply chain. In Europe, Edward Snowden cautions that increasing use of high-tech surveillance by governments during the COVID-19 pandemic may run even after the crisis is over. Johns Hopkins University builds a digital dashboard on COVID-19 cases using data from various intra and inter-governmental sources. 
And finally, as the weekend begins, its time to look for some games to play and learn a new way of watching movies on Netflix.
Trump Administration renews attack against Huawei
Senior White House officials have agreed to new measures to restrict chip supply to Huawei, Reuters reported according to sources familiar with the matter. 
 The decision came when U.S. officials from the National Security Council and the U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Energy and Communication met on Wednesday to change the Foreign Product Rule.
 That alteration will subject some foreign-made goods using U.S. technology to follow U.S. regulations.
 For Huawei, this could have a significant impact on its chip-making supply chain. The Chinese smartphone maker is buying chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).
 TSMC is one of chip makers that uses equipment made by U.S. companies. Some of the leading American chip making equipment makers are KLA Corp, LAM Research and Applied Materials
 If the rule is amended, TSMC will have to get U.S. licences to supply chips to Huawei. This could severely impact Huawei’s supply chain.
 President Donald trump is yet to finalise the changes in rule.
Governments’ high-tech surveillance during COVID-19 may last longer, Snowden says
Edward Snowden warned that governments’ increasing use of high-tech surveillance measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 disease may have a lasting impact.
 The former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who leaked confidential documents related to mass surveillance activities, said governments may extend their access to people’s personal information even after the virus has been contained.
During the pandemic, governments may demand fitness tracking app companies to share health information on their users to manage a public health crisis, he said in a live-streamed interview with the Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival.
And after the virus is gone, and the data secure with the governments, they can ask for new data citing some other reason to justify continuously gathering citizens’ data, he added. 
Mr. Snowden is facing charges of espionage and theft of U.S. government property. And he is living in Russia since 2013.

A digital dashboard to track global COVID-19 cases
As the coronavirus spreads across the planet, here’s a digital dashboard that you can use to keep up with officially reported cases.
Johns Hopkins University’s Centre for Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) has developed an interactive web-based dashboard.
It helps to visualise and track COVID-19 cases in real-time. It lays out the location and the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries across all affected countries.
 All the data collected to build the dashboard has been made freely available, and it can be accessed in the GitHub repository.
 The dashboard reports data at a provincial level in China, city-level in Australia, Canada and U.S., and at country-level otherwise.
CSSE sources data from DXY, an online platform run by Chinese medical community, for cases reported in China. These are updated every 15 minutes.
For data on COVID-19 cases from other countries, CSSE monitors various twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard.
 Prior to manually updating the information, the team confirms the numbers with regional and local health departments, such as China CDC (CCDC), Hong Kong Department of Health, Macau Government, Taiwan CDC, European CDC (ECDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as city and state level health authorities.

COVID-19: Madurai Kavalan app uses GPS tracking for the Coronavirus pandemic,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jiovio-healthcare-madurai-expands-madurai-kavalan-app-for-gps-tracking-coronavirus-quarantine/article31185828.ece," With the Tamil Nadu government directing all persons who have returned from abroad after February 15 to strictly remain in self-quarantine, JioVio Healthcare, a Madurai-based start-up has launched a new feature in their existing Madurai Kavalan App to help the government fight COVID-19 by tracking all such individuals.






A screenshot from the Madurai Kavalan app
 






Launched on Sunday, the Corona feature is integrated in the app, which already has 50,000 users. Existing users are just required to update it. ""The new Corona feature will monitor, track and assist all those who have been advised home or institution quarantine with GPS,"" says city engineer M Senthil Kumar, the founder of JioVio healthcare.
This feature is especially relevant now, with news of people escaping from quarantine: the latest case in point being a Dubai returnee who escaped from Chinna Udaippu isolation camp, near Madurai airport on Thursday, and travelled to Sivagangai on a bike borrowed from a friend purportedly to meet his girlfriend.
The new feature monitors self-quarantine patients with GPS technology, and provide users with round-the-clock real time updates. ""Those who are found violating medical advice will be immediately sent a warning and the police will be informed, who will then go to the person's house to check and take necessary action,"" says Senthil.
About JioVio HealthcareSenthil and his team have been providing tech-driven solutions to social and civic issues since 2014 with their apps such as Hello Collector and Swachch Madurai. The Madurai Kavalan app helps city residents to notify the police about their locked homes, lodge complaints and upload pictures of suspicious persons, unclaimed baggage or vehicles without having to visit the police station. It has contact details of police personnel in 62 units in the district and helps Madurai Police to prevent burglaries. 
It also features a news feed, and help users identify fake news via daily listings of fake audio-visual clips being circulated on social media. Users can also send WhatsApp forwards to the team, via the app, to check their veracity.
The application was readied in a short span of 48 hours and requires the collaboration of district authorities. The District Collector has the name, addresses and phone numbers of all those who have been asked to stay in home quarantine and each of them have now been told to download the Madurai Kavalan app with all required details and a selfie.
 ""The police and other department staff and volunteers were under pressure to follow up on every quarantined person. This technology now makes it easier for them,"" adds Senthil. 
There are nearly 15,500 people under home quarantine across Tamil Nadu.

Since the recent launch, 1500 new users have added to the app in Madurai. The already functional Theni Kavalan app with 4000 users, was relaunched with the new Corona feature by the District Collector today.
Also Cauvery Kavalan in Trichy with 11,000 users and NamKaval with 5500 users in Namakkal, will be relaunched with the new feature tomorrow.
In Thiruvannamalai and Krishnagiri, the district administration has agreed to launch the app as Q-Care (Quarantine Care). ""Our teams are briefing the officials in these two districts and it should be done over the weekend,"" says Senthil. 
""We are in talks with all the district authorities and hope to launch it across the State within a week,"" says Senthil, who is also in touch with the Kerala government for providing the technical support to configure the app's features in the back-end system.
""We are keen and open to collaborate with all other State governments, NGOs, hospitals and different departments that are involved in containing the pandemic,"" he adds.

A Huawei phone without Google
Huawei is set to launch its flagship P40 series phones at an event that is streamed live on Wednesday. Ahead of the launch, The Verge previews what to expect from a phone devoid of Google Mobile Services (GMS).
The new Huawei device will be sold without Google Suite apps as the search giant is banned from working with Huawei. This will be a significantly affect buyers as several apps in Android are tied to GMS.
For instance, the Uber app uses GMS to determine location information for mapping data. Several other app developers on the Android ecosystem use Google’s tools to build their software. That is making the take off harder for alternative app stores.
To counter Google’s dominant position, Huawei plans to launch its own app store. With a billion-dollar investment, the Chinese smartphone maker is building AppGallery for western audience.
Another alternative for users of P40 would be Amazon’s app store. Or they may use a slightly inconvenient method to access 
Google apps through the Phone Clone tool provided by Huawei.
The Phone Clone has to be installed while the device is being set up. Once it is done, you have to install the same app from Play Store in a different device with the apps you want on the P40. And after the two devices are paired, you can use the GMS supported apps on your P40. However, core Google apps still can’t be used in the Huawei device.
Partying virtually using a viral app during the COVID-19 lockdown
As millions of people have been forced into a lockdown to reduce the risk for COVID-19, many are taking time out to party, virtually.
People are congregating with their friends via video-chats to socialise.
One of the apps, Houseparty, owned by Epic Games, has become an overnight sensation, Financial Times reported.
The app has 20 lakh new downloads compared with around 1.3 lakh the same week a month ago, according to data from App Annie.
Houseparty has always had a high user rate among teenagers. But recently, millennials and more older people are flocking to the app, which is considered more casual compared to Zoom or Google’s Hangouts.
The app has a focus on shared experience. It allows users to play in-app games and share screen to watch same content together. Houseparty permits upto 8 persons in one group.

The face shields are made by the same team that manufactures space suits and crew equipment. As on Tuesday, SpaceX has made 75 masks and donate them to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to an email seen by The Verge.
When the COVID-19 broke out, Mr. Musk repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the disease. His stance seems to have changed after two SpaceX workers tested positive for COVID-19, and at least another dozen employees quarantined on Tuesday.

Dos and Don’ts of Online Video Meetings
As a large multitude of people are shifting to working from home, there are some basic etiquettes one can follow to have a useful and productive video meeting.
Working from home can be a great time for individuals, but one has to ensure that personal and professional boundaries don’t blur. This will help you to make the best use of time.
Here are a few steps to follow before you get into that video-call:
Test your camera settings and make sure that your image is clearly visible. Check your microphone to see if the sound quality is perfect, and that there is no echo.
During group meetings, default to mute so that any background noise wouldn’t disturb the group environment. Also set an agenda for the call so that you don’t use the video-calling time to bring it up. 
Try limiting the number of video-calls as not all meetings require a video interface. A simply phone call may sometimes be more effective. Unnecessary video-call will also strain the internet bandwidth.",technology

She has given $1 million to the charity No Kid Hungry, which says it has so far spread $2 million across 30 states to feed low-income children and their families, reports dailymail.co.uk.
“As of this week, over a billion children are out of school worldwide because of closures linked to coronavirus,” said Jolie, 44.
“Many children depend on the care and nutrition they receive during school hours, including nearly 22 million children in America who rely on food support. No Kid Hungry is making resolute efforts to reach as many of those children as possible,” added the actress, known for her philanthropy.

Web-series ‘Hunters’ is a bit too risky in a world full of Holocaust conspiracy theorists,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/web-series-hunters-is-a-bit-too-risky-in-a-world-full-of-holocaust-conspiracy-theorists/article31183807.ece,"You’re a real-life Jew-perhero now,” goes a line from Amazon Prime Video’s Hunters, the alternative history thriller series that premiered last month — it’s a significant line for a show that directly references superhero comics in nearly every episode. In a way, it betrays both the strengths and the weaknesses of the story; it has the raw energy of a comic-book adventure, but at crucial moments, its style seems dissonant with the truly horrific Holocaust accounts it presents. 
The premise is simple (even if its plot fluctuations are not): in 1977, a group of New York-based Jews assemble and form a Nazi-hunting team, dedicated to capturing and killing the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing — former Nazis living in the U.S. under new identities. The team is led by the super-rich, super-resourceful Meyer Offerman, played by Al Pacino (the iconic actor’s first appearance in a series since HBO’s Angels in America in 2003). Other notable members include moviestar and master of disguise Lonny Flash, played by the perfectly cast Josh Radnor (better known as Ted from How I Met Your Mother), plus Saul Rubinek and Carol Kane teaming up to play Murray and Mindy Markowitz, the team’s middle-aged electronics and signals experts, respectively.
Too much flair
All the actors turn in fine performances, with Pacino and Radnor leading the way. Hunters is also well served by its crew: the action scenes are superbly shot, the Holocaust flashback set pieces crafted with more than a touch of flair. Indeed, some would say too much flair at times: the first episode has a scene with a fictional SS officer playing on a giant chessboard with human pieces — if the piece dies, the person dies as well. Apart from this one off-putting scene (which for some reason channelises medieval monarchs) the flashbacks are, as a rule, very effective indeed.
Hunters is part of a well-documented tradition in British/ American books, movies and television — ‘what if’ stories involving World War II and the Nazi regime. Philip Roth’s masterful novel The Plot Against America, Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 film Inglourious Basterds and Amazon Prime’s own previous show The Man in the High Castle (based on Philip K. Dick’s novel of the same name) — all were very well-received by both audiences and critics.
What gives, then, with Hunters? Why did Stephen D. Smith, Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, condemn the show, demanding that Amazon cancel it? Smith’s argument is simple, and I must say, quite iron-clad: a show like Hunters, which plays fast and loose with history, is simply too much of a risk in a world where holocaust conspiracy theorists are still legion (“its pernicious blend of fact and fiction risks being weaponised by Holocaust deniers”). In some places, the show’s writers present real personalities like Simon Wiesenthal (Judd Hirsch) with a remarkable degree of historical accuracy. But in other places, well, human chessboards abound. 
Smith writes: “The problem is the premise. Survivors of the Shoah sought justice, not revenge. Not so in Hunters. The series’ specious spectacle of eye-for-eye justice (a term one of the ‘Hunters’ uses verbatim in the fifth episode) collapses all meaningful differences between victim and perpetrator.”
And that, really, is the kicker: in a world rampant with ‘both-sideism’, do we really want to provide additional fodder to bad-faith commentators, trolls looking to downplay (or worse, outright deny) one of the darkest chapters in human history? 
Is the pleasure of watching Pacino pull off complicated Yiddish phrases worth it? I’d say no — but the ball is in Amazon’s court.

COVID-19: Radio jockeys with private FM stations in Kerala are working from home during lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/radio-jockeys-are-working-from-home-during-covid-19-lockdown/article31182593.ece," 
“I am speaking to you from the attic and I hope my words are reaching all of you staying safe at home,” announces RJ Joseph Annamkutty Jose from his home at Karukutty, near Angamaly.
While some FM stations in Kerala have minimised operations from office with few RJs coming in, presenters in Red FM, Big FM, Radio Mirchi and Radio Mango have completely moved to work-from-home mode in view of the current lockdown to contain the spread of Coronavirus.

“All five RJs of our station have been provided with the equipment to set up a radio booth at our homes. Although a basic frame to play the songs has been put in by our scheduler, our RJs can change the song using their phone, if needed, or can make suggestions,” says Firoz A Azeez, RJ and programming head, Big FM – Kerala.
Listeners have been informed that their favourite RJs are working from home, so live calls cannot be taken. Instead, the jockeys interact with listeners through their official or personal social media handles. “They can send us messages to our official WhatsApp number or Facebook page. Technical snags might be there, but we are looking at the brighter side. Although we had the option to play songs back- to-back we want to work this way to keep the listeners engaged,” says Parvathy Nair, senior programming head, Red FM-Thiruvananthapuram. Some of them post videos about how they record their shows at home as well.
On air, from homeA software has been installed on their laptops in place of the studio equipment. The arrangement is such that recordings on their phones are transferred to the laptop and edited using the software before they are sent to the music scheduler/manager who plays the song. In some stations the schedulers too are working from their homes.
The content has been revised without games and comedy capsules. RJs have been directed to be sunny and positive instead of concentrating on the downside of the outbreak. So they give pointers about social and physical distancing, as well as remind people about precautions to be taken. “We give information about how many people have recovered after testing positive for COVID-19, air their bytes and get brief interviews from ministers, health experts and celebrities on how to stay safe. We have tweaked the content to include topics such as ‘how to stay healthy and positive while at home’,” says Firoz.

Nintendo Direct Mini announces a wave of new games for the Switch,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/nintendo-direct-mini-2020-highlights-new-games-and-expansions-packs-for-nintendo-switch/article31179447.ece,"Nintendo has been having a successful couple of years, with the Nintendo Switch being one of the most favoured hand-held gaming consoles ever made. On March 26, through Nintendo Direct Mini (a live video presentation by Nintendo) shined the spotlight on a breadth of different types of games launching for the Nintendo Switch system in 2020. 
Big numbers Though the Nintendo Switch launched four years after the first launch of Xbox One in 2013, the Switch managed to surpass Xbox One in sales. As of late January 2020, the 50 million Nintendo Switch devices were sold internationally. Clearly, the Japanese gaming company is having its time in the sun. Financial datasets from Nintendo reveals that between March 2018 and March 2019, net sales were valued at US$11,070,000,000 and forecasts predict a steady increase for March 2020. 
According to Nick Chavez, Nintendo of America’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, “In addition to Nintendo franchises, 2020 will see the Nintendo Switch library grow even more with strong support from a diverse field of publishing partners like 2K, Electronic Arts and Square Enix.”
Games featured in the video include sprawling role-playing adventures like Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition and Bravely Default II. Plus, classic franchises like Borderlands, XCOM 2 and BioShock coming to a Nintendo system for the first time. For the sake of nostalgia, one can look forward to remakes of fan favorites like Burnout Paradise Remastered and Panzer Dragoon: Remake. Titles perfect for both casual and longtime gamers include Good Job!, Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics and Animal Crossing: New Horizons (which is already available, but there is a seasonal Easter event and Earth day special with an update).

Marvel gaming fans can get their hands on a third expansion pack, Shadow Of Doom, for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order. The add-on sees Doctor Doom versus Marvel’s first family, Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom are now playable characters as they fight through a new story campaign.
Sold out internationally, Ring Bit Adventure has been wildly popular — especially during the COVID-19 lockdown for its approach to fitness. Nintendo Direct Mini announced a new Rhythm Game mode, an option to switch to a female voice and to change the language of the in-game voice, and more. In the Rhythm Game mode, move to the beat of a dozen music tracks from Ring Fit Adventure and a few tracks from popular Nintendo games, including Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

Heartfelt thanks to the Sagar Family for this service to the Nation during this moment who took immense effort to mobilise their resources and made available content to Team @ddnational in Mumbai on a war footing.
The announcement comes at a time when the country is going through a 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of COVID 19.
The 74-episode Ramayana was telecast from 25 January 1987 to 31 July 1988 and the 90-episode Mahabharata from 2 October 1988 to 24 June 1990.
“DD was already in talks for reacquisition of iconic serials several weeks prior to this situation. That process will continue. Right now, the lockdown being the priority, the content has been shared in national interest,” a senior Prasar Bharati official said.

Here’s how bakers and dancers are keeping people engaged through social media during lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/heres-how-bakers-and-dancers-are-keeping-people-engaged-during-the-lockdown/article31184563.ece,"Usually, Faiz Begum’s schedule is packed with high energy workouts at her fitness studio where she conducts Zumba, Tabata and Zaco. Now the lockdown of the State left her with a lot of free time. Like a lot of us out there, all Faiz did was receive and read worrisome news about the virus and the death toll. “It started taking a toll on my mental health and I realised that there were a lot of people like me who weren't used to staying at home. So I started with instagram workout sessions where I conducted classes by going live on my handle,” she says. 
These days she looks forward to these classes that she conducts in the mornings and afternoons. “I have made a schedule of nine exercises that are to be done in three rounds. I have designed these routines keeping in mind that people are home and have limited space,” adds the Visakhapatnam-based trainer. 
Faiz has been a fitness trainer for over a decade now. However, this is the first time that she has moved her classes online. “It is new and it is fun as there are no geographical boundaries when it comes to online classes.” But she admits that this cannot be a long time option. “As an instructor my job is not just to teach workout routines but also to work on the individual posture and movements of my clients That is not possible when the classes are conducted virtually.” 
While Instagram came to Faiz’s aid, Ramya Adimulam, a wellness coach who runs the gym Fitness Edge has been encouraging her students through WhatsApp. “ We have a group with gym members added in it. I post a new workout routine every day. Since people can no longer step out for gyms they can use these routines to keep themselves healthy,” she explains. 
Social distancing has helped Ramya discover her love for yoga. “I spend at least one hour in the morning doing yoga along with my kids. Including kids is important as they too get affected by being confined to the house,” she says. She posts most of these videos of her workout on her Instagram and encourages people to do the same. 
Twenty-four year old Divya Gopal is busy putting together recipes of ‘Quarantine snacks’. A medicine student, Divya is using her time at home to conduct baking classes online. “I took to baking two years ago. This summer I had planned to conduct baking classes. However, with social distancing, I had to cancel them. But I wanted to help people get their minds off the difficult times. So I decided to start the classes online. Till now I have conducted two live sessions on Instagram and they have been quite successful,” she says. 
In the upcoming sessions of ‘Quarantine snacks’ she will share recipes that are quick and contain no maida or white sugar. “The session will include chocolate muffins and fudge which are comparatively easy and quick to make. I will also make jeera cookies that people can enjoy during their tea time,” she adds. 
Divya, who runs the handle @sweet_toothhhh tweaked her recipes to make them as simple as possible. “ I am aware that people may not have all the ingredients in abundance at home so I am putting out only those recipes that can be made from basic ingredients.” 
Always wanted to learn the perfect moves, but were too shy or too busy to go for a dance class? Then you are in for some good news, as dance studios in the city are conducting free online classes. 
After Sharat Pirates was forced to shut the doors of his dance studio- Broadway Dance Academy to keep his students safe, he decided to keep them active by conducting classes online. Now, every alternate day, he goes live on his facebook page (Sharat Pirates). “ It is not just a dance class but a dance-based class where people are also taught fitness regimes. I try to keep my steps simple and easy to follow as I have no idea who my audience is,” he says.
Interestingly, Sharat himself learns through online conference classes. “Online classes have been around for a while now, it is just that they are discovering their potential now,” he adds. 
Since he does not have to physically visit his dance classes, Sharat is enjoying his free time home. “I have dogs at home, so now I spend more time with them. I am also working on myself and learning more styles of dance online.” ",society
Quarantine tales: Who fed the dogs out? ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/who-fed-the-dogs-out/article31184262.ece,"Gandhinagar’s furry four-legged inhabitants can recognise this two-wheeler from miles away. After all, this is their regular buffet-on-wheels service. Every morning at 4.45 am, Radhika Kasturirangan loads her scooter with two big buckets of food and takes it for the strays around her locality. Ever since the Government called for a 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, her radius has extended to include areas towards Kotturpuram. “Now that the roads are empty I feed them at 5.30 in the evening,” says Radhika, who has been at this for the last 15 years. She feeds 70 dogs regularly, but given the current situation and with a number of restaurants and push carts shut, she says that around 20-25 new dogs have joined the party.







It’s not just food, sometimes finding water too becomes a task for these animals. “Today I noticed a water bowl was empty outside one of the shops and there were a few animals around, looking expectantly at it. I filled it. The staff used to fill it everyday for the animals on the roads but they are on leave now,” she says.
Latha Thampy, coordinator of People For Animals in Thiruvananthapuram also urges people to set out water for their neighbourhood's community dogs and cats. She says, “Since it is summer, water is a must for all animals. Dry food, especially pet food makes them thirstier. So I cooked rice and fish waste that I got from Palayalam market to feed the dogs.”
When the stay-at-home orders were first implemented, a few 'feeders' were uncertain about what it meant in terms of going about their usual routines. Some were apprehensive after watching videos of food delivery executives being beaten up by a few cops in other cities. Fortunately a recent statement issued by the Animal Welfare Board of India on Monday, helped clarify the rules: It states that “feed and fodder for large animals and food for companion and stray animals is an essential service and maybe kept operational during lockdowns.” To help aid better facilitation, Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) and animal rights activist, on Twitter announced the availability of 100 passes for feeders per district.
“This pass helps in case the police or anyone stops you,” says 23-year-old Anoushka Mehta, who, three days back, got into trouble with her neighbours, despite social distancing and being out alone, for feeding her regular pooches on the streets. “This is an essential service,” she reiterates, adding, “I also get the dogs neutered, and feeding them means they are more manageable. Some people don’t understand that.” The Delhi-based dentist has been feeding dogs in her locality in Lajpat Nagar as well as in Faridabad where she went to college. “Now that we are under lockdown, I managed to source 100 kilograms of dog food with the help of generous people on social media. I’ve delivered it to my college — shut for now —where the watchman on duty feeds the dogs on campus and around.” Anoushka gets chicken and rice cooked at home for 150 dogs in her neighbourhood. 
Dinesh Baba, who started Cloud No 9 Kennel and Nursing Care in Chennai says, “While it is important to feed animals, it is also imperative to follow social distancing.” He advises going out alone rather than taking to the streets in a group and defeating the purpose of a lockdown. He also suggests cooking a little extra if possible and leaving the excess food outside the house so animals can help themselves to it. Strays in residential areas will somehow get a meal, he believes. His concern is dogs who live in non-residential areas like highways and railway stations.
Dinesh and his jeep — laden with a big degchi full of rice and dal or chicken or eggs — are a familiar sight on the stretch that runs from Injambakkam to Porur. That is the feeding ground for nearly 300 wagging tails that await him. He also has a few vegetables to feed the cows that amble along.
Dinesh says the Chennai police have been cooperative, as long as he travels alone. “They are, in fact passionate towards animal and point you to a few more hungry ones,” he says. Meanwhile in Thiruvananthapuram, a few volunteers, despite possessing I-cards issued by FIAPO (Federation of Indian Animals Protection Organisation), faced problems in a few places. Since Tuesday, activists of People for Animals (PFA), Street Dog Watch (SDW) and FIAPO have been out in the streets to feed stray dogs.
 “I put up a post on Facebook and exhorted people to give ₹10 to feed a dog. It elicited a good response and I bought biscuits with that money,"" says Parvathy Mohan, coordinator of FIAPO, adding that she managed to feed about 300 dogs with the money.

"In Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram’s WFH population is still getting used to the concept ",https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-thiruvananthapuram-in-kerala-is-getting-used-to-the-work-from-home-concept/article31183924.ece,"
In his 23-year-old career, R Jayaram, an Under Secretary with the General Administration Department, Government of Kerala, in Thiruvananthapuram is working from home (WFH) for the very first time. He is not alone. Employees in different fields are experiencing what it is like to share their home with their workspace. 
Until now WFH was considered a privilege that was available only to a few in the IT sector and a handful of others whose work allowed them the ‘luxury’ of choosing to work from home. However, since the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, people in the city have begun comparing notes about WFH. Opinions are as divided, even as a new work culture is being shaped. 
WFH boon 
While a colleague writes a verse in praise of “office is heaven”, there are others talking of the benefits of WFH. “In fact, many are following posts on social media that are giving out tips on how to efficiently work from home,” says Nipun Varma, offshore delivery manager with an MNC in Technopark. 
Although some of them admit that they miss the coffee breaks, gossip and banter, many who are parents, especially those with school-going children or infants, are happy with the advantages. Since all schools, crèches, and day care centres have closed, the WFH has come as a boon for hard-pressed parents.
“My five-year-old son often knocks at my door since he knows I am around and even picks up some of the calls if I am not near my phone! But I am able to save the time driving from my home at Vattiyoorkavu to Technopark, 18 km away,” says Neethu Rajagopal, a systems analyst with an MNC. 
For teachers like Remya Krishna, a CUEMATH teacher, it was all about adapting to a new system to ensure that her students did not miss out on their lessons. “My students are excited about doing digital workbooks on laptops or desktops. They finish the assignments faster than before and I am able to give realtime feedback as well. We have two classes of one-hour duration each every week and it is the younger kids who look forward to this than those in higher classes,” she says.
What does 46-year-old Jayaram think about it? “I handle a section where I have to verify several documents before preparing the final report. This takes at least an hour in certain cases. It becomes difficult to concentrate when you are in office because of the inflow ofvisitors, meetings or outdoor work, whereas there is nobody to disturb me at home,” saysJayaram.
WFH? Not a fan
A Central government employee in an R&D organisation, however, feels that virtual meetings and online classes for engineering students are not the same as face-to-face interactions and working from office.
Techie Priya Sankar, who has worked from home in the US, points out that things can be stressful as the team is not working at the same place. “Work-related interactions and discussions happen over phone or chats and it is time-consuming. I find that I end up taking more time to finish my work,” she says. 
EXPERTS SPEAK
Entrepreneur Minu Mary Mathew has been working from home ever since she quit her job in the retail industry five years ago. She gives a few pointers on how to make the arrangement work. 
* Maintain a morning routine. 
* Dress like you would go to work and be presentable on your video calls.
* Get a work spot at home and don’t snuggle up on the bed or the couch. 
* Speak to your family about work time and break time. Take breaks and get exercise.
* Stay hydrated and air out rooms and windows to feel fresh.
* Catch up with colleagues on video calls to stay connected and informed.
* Since you save time you'd otherwise spend on commuting to work, utilise that by enrolling for online courses and workshops, or engage in a hobby/art project.
Ayyappan Nair, scientist with a company in the United States, started working from home nearly four years ago. “I have never worked from home before that and it was difficult for me to adjust in the beginning. But it changed my life. In my case I am free during the day and that’s when I involve myself in hobbies and outdoor activities. Before the lockdown was announced, I used to go cycling. I get my calls between 6 pm and 4 am and they are not random calls but those that have been planned a week in advance. 
* The most important tip for anyone working from home is that one has to be disciplined, both in your work and lifestyle. 
* Watch out for distractions when you are with family.
* Avoid the temptation to snack or watch television. 
* Interact more with your family and community in your leisure time. Follow your passion or hobby, if possible. 
* Since you don’t commute to office, make use of that time to exercise. That will make life better.",society
No laughing matter ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/no-laughing-matter/article31181321.ece," “When we were wishing each other with a namaste – they laughed. When we were washing our hands and legs before entering our homes – they laughed again. When we followed a pure vegetarian diet – they laughed at that, too. When we were doing yoga – yes, you guessed right, they laughed. When we were burning our dead, ditto. And when we bathed after attending a funeral – heck, they laughed uproariously. And, finally, now that the world is suffering, we, deservedly, as was expected, as we always do in the end, are the ones ROFLing.”
When I got this message on WhatsApp for the 32nd time, I had no choice but to respond. The lucky winner was my childhood friend from Seattle, Shanks Shankaran, CEO (laid off) of Thillana Tech.
 ‘Who, da?’ I texted him.
‘What do you mean ‘who’?’ responded Shanks.
‘Who laughed? When we were doing these fantastic things, like namaste, yoga, being vegetarian, and having post-funeral baths with ancient Liril soap under a gurgling waterfall like a pre-vedic Karen Lunel, which fool was laughing? Please let me know. I want to write him a stiff letter.’
Shanks sent one smiley with dark glasses, one smiley with tears and two brown-skinned thumbs-ups as a response.
‘I don’t get it, da,’ I texted. ‘Please elaborate. I want to set them straight. Do you mean the Mughals? Were they the culprits, eating large plates of biryani with onion raita and laughing inappropriately at us while we ate keerai vadai? Was it the Brits, then? Their stiff upper lips quivering with vulgar mirth? Or was it aliens from Rahu–Ketu? Who was laughing at us?’
‘All of them. Except the aliens. That’s plain stupid,’ he replied.
‘So you think we shouldn’t be made fun of?’ I said.
‘Yes. How dare they?’
‘Who isn’t made fun of? Everyone is,’ I said.
I got a shrug emoji. A second or two later, inexplicably, two balloon ones. 
‘Are you saying other great civilisations like Greece and Egypt weren’t made fun of?’ I persisted. ‘You think satire and mockery were invented by the Mughals and Brits for the sole purpose of demeaning our unsulliable culture alone? And ours is the greatest, fabbest, coolest, cleverest, uniquest culture that just can’t be lampooned?’
Shanks sent me four emojis. The first three were of the middle finger. The last one was an anthropomorphic representation of what we refer to as asingam in our culture.
I went on: ‘Tell me, do you think ancient Greek, Egyptian, Arab, Mesopotamian, Roman and the myriad Native American cultures, to name a few, didn’t have a whit of common sense or wisdom?’
‘What’s your point?’ said my friend. Between ‘your’ and ‘point’ was a word no one in our ancient culture would have used.
‘Listen, no one is making any more fun of us than they are of anyone else. We aren’t that special.’
My friend sent me instructions that, were I to follow, would involve a corkscrew, industrial glue and a couple of double-strength rubber bands. And a specific part (or two) of my anatomy that one doesn’t discuss in polite company.
‘One more thing, Shanks,’ I texted. ‘Today, we may be buying up masks, sending heart emojis to our cooks or hiding petrified under our beds. But we aren’t LMAOing, ROFLing, or even LOLing, trust me. No one is. Not us. Not them. Not you. The only one laughing like Surpanakha is Covid-19. Hope you’ve stocked up on the toilet paper.’

The effect of Coronavirus lockdown on dogs in Coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-are-pets-and-street-dogs-in-coimbatore-coping-during-lockdown/article31181259.ece,"
A friend calls frantically. “They say pets will transmit the coronavirus. What do I do about my dogs?” Mini Vasudevan, co-founder of Coimbatore’s Humane Animal Society (HAS), sighs, “It’s 100% false but there’s so much misinformation going around.” Admitting that people, including her staff, were getting scared, she says, “We are working on overcoming that by disseminating correct information.”

HAS is also dealing with panicked calls from people wanting to give up pets. “I haven’t heard of any actual cases of abandonment,” says Mini cautiously. “But there have been calls asking if they can drop off the pets at the shelter. Some threaten to abandon the dogs if we don’t take them in but so far we’ve managed to convince them. For now we’ve closed our out-patient dispensary.”

Special Arrangement  





Megha Jose, founder of The Pawsome People Project, agrees that people are not abandoning pets in the city but “we’ve got calls regarding pets stuck in cages and not being fed. We’re trying to get to those dogs and feed them as the owner can’t reach them.” Speaking of which, Mini brings up pet shops where the animals are kept in tiny cages behind closed doors. “The only agency that can take action is the SPCA and we don’t have one in Coimbatore. I shudder to think of what’s happening behind those closed doors.”

Special Arrangement  





Pet owners who are not falling for the fear mongering are coping, says Ahalya Chinnaraj, who owns 14 rescued dogs. She takes them for a walk down her street late at night when no one is around. “And wash them down once we’re home.” The bigger problem, according to her, is feeding the street dogs. “Some families, including ours, in Sivananda Colony, Tatabad, would leave food before our houses. Suddenly we’re noticing that there are more dogs.” Megha has an explanation for this. “A few of our volunteers stepped out to feed street dogs and we noticed that they had moved from their original spots. This is probably because they were moving in search of food.” 
Ahalya is grateful to a veterinary clinic that donated some bags of commercial dog food. “We’re keeping that for the street dogs. But even for our dogs we’d only stocked up for around a week to 10 days. We didn’t expect a three-week lockdown.”
All three make the same point: street dogs usually congregated around meat stalls or small tea shops or restaurants and found a meal there. But now with all these closed, the dogs are struggling. “In some areas, dogs are howling and crying for food and rummaging through trash cans,” says Megha. “So we’re trying to cover as many areas as possible through our volunteers and feed them. We have appealed to people through our social media handles to feed as many dogs as possible.”
Megha says The Pawsome People Project volunteers have not been stopped in any way — “what’s nice is that the cops in the city are letting us do this and we’ve faced no issues so far”. Ahalya, who is in touch with other volunteers, says they haven’t faced any trouble either. However, Mini has another tale to tell. “Our staff coming to work were stopped. Even when they tried explaining that the veterinary sector comes under the exempt category, they wouldn’t let them go. Even our ambulance was stopped. The police are not accepting our identity cards, so we’re now creating letters with photos for all our staff on the official letterhead. People who are enforcing the law need to be clear about what they are enforcing.” 
Megha, Mini and Ahalya also emphasise that these are early days but they have a lot of faith in the people of Coimbatore. “Those who feed these dogs regularly will manage,”says Ahalya, while Mini narrates a story of someone who created a feeder and a water trough for dogs. “Our people are very kind, they will help,” she says confidently.",society
World is now in recession: IMF,https://www.thehindu.com/business/world-is-now-in-recession-imf/article31187068.ece,"The COVID-19 pandemic has driven the global economy into a downturn that will require massive funding to help developing nations, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said Friday.
“It is clear that we have entered a recession” that will be worse than the one in 2009, following the global financial crisis, she said.
Also read: How can India contain the economic impact of COVID-19?
With the worldwide economic “sudden stop,” Ms. Georgieva said the fund’s estimate “for the overall financial needs of emerging markets is $2.5 trillion.”
But she warned the estimate “is on the lower end.”
Governments in emerging markets, which have suffered an exodus of capital of more than $83 billion in recent weeks, can cover much of that, but “clearly the domestic resources are insufficient” and many already have high debt loads.

“Testing is an important way to contain the spread as we have seen in other countries like South Korea. This will help identify positive patients quickly and help reduce the spread of infection,” said Ameera Shah, managing director, Metropolis Healthcare Ltd.
“We now know that it is possible for people to spread the infection even while they display no symptoms. This is also the reason why the WHO has also been recommending widespread testing,” she added.
As an approval criteri,a the ICMR has approved labs that have NABL accreditation and have previously conducted Swine Flu testing. 
The logic behind this move is that the sample collection guidelines and protocols for Swine Flu and COVID-19 are similar. 
“The challenge for all laboratories in the beginning was to set up isolation units for testing samples. Because unlike Swine Flu, where vaccine is available, there is no such safe zone with Covid -19 samples. Besides that, training of technicians and preparing them for this challenge is very important,” she said.
“Our staff is already trained to collect Swine Flu Samples. Our technicians underwent rigorous training for collection of samples for COVID-19, especially the precautionary measures that are needed to ensure there is no room for infection,” she added.
Ms. Shah said the company’s lab officials are fully protected with protective gear, masks and goggles. No part of the body is exposed.
Metropolis is offering home collection of samples.
“This is the most ideal way to collect samples to minimise risk of infection. We are currently undertaking home collection in Mumbai and Pune. A doctor’s prescription and a valid Government ID is must for the lab to conduct a COVID-19 test for a patient,” she said.
“At present Metropolis has the capacity to handle 1000 tests per day in Mumbai and Pune each. We will begin testing in Chennai, Bengaluru and Delhi very soon,” she added.
For sample collection from home and testing in Mumbai, people can call the company’s helpline number 8422801801 for any queries regarding COVID-19 testing.",business

Welcoming the slew of measures announced by the RBI, Sangita Reddy, president, FICCI, said, “This has been a very comprehensive set of announcements and highlights action in all the key areas that were expected.”
 “The current situation in the economy and financial markets is extremely fragile. It required a massive dose of monetary stimulus to be injected at the earliest and the RBI has done just that.”

He said given that the current lockdown is expected to have a negative impact on the cash flows of firms, the moratorium on repayments of term loans for a period of 3 months will help companies tide over this period.
Murthy Nagarajan, head, Fixed Income, Tata Asset Management, said: “This is the RBI response to the adverse macro economic situation due to coronavirus.

The relaxation is also applicable on consumer loans such as auto loans, home loans and personal loans, as well as credit card outstanding dues. A consumer may now choose not to pay the monthly equated instalments on their loans for the next three months.
“The repayment schedule for such loans, as also the residual tenor, will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period,” the RBI said.
The banking regulator clarified that interest would continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period. 
The credit score of the borrower will not change due to the non-payment since the loan will not be classified as ‘non-performing’ by the lender. 
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar clarified that the moratorium is applicable for all borrowers of term loans and banks would have no discretion.
He also said that a customer who wanted to continue with the EMIs for the next three months could do so.
However, it is not clear yet as to whether the customer has to apply for the moratorium on instalments or it would happen automatically. EMIs paid through the electronic clearing service are automatically debited to the customer’s account.
The RBI has also permitted the lenders to allow borrowers of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit or overdraft, payment of interest by three months outstanding as on March 1, 2020. “The accumulated interest for the period will be paid after the expiry of the deferment period,” the RBI said.

In an order, Chief General Manager (Non-Life) Yegnapriya Bharath said the validity of premium rates for Motor Third Party Liability Insurance Cover for 2019-20 stands extended beyond March 31.
What this means for vehicle owners is that a revision in the rates, primarily an increase for several category of automobiles, IRDAI had proposed for 2020-21 will not be implemented until further notice.
The rates for the third party cover, which is mandatory for all automobiles, are decided by IRDAI, while the rate for Own Damage, another key component of motor insurance, is de-tariffed or in other words insurers decide that.
The third party rates are reviewed by the regulator for every financial year, a process that kicks off with an exposure draft on the new rates in March seeking comments from the stakeholders. 
While Friday’s decision of IRDAI extending validity of the rates would mean no change for now, there always is the possibility of the regulator asking insurers to recover the differential amount later from those who buy the cover in the interim.
The exposure draft, on the rates for 2020-21, had mooted an increase in the MTP premium rates for cars, two-wheelers, good carriers, buses, including school buses. The increase mooted was upwards of 5%, with only a few sub-segment of automobiles spared.",business

Reactions to RBI policy announcement 
While cutting benchmark rates, the RBI has continued with its accommodative stance. Four of the six members of the monetary policy committee voted in favour of a 75 bps rate cut.
Apart from cutting the repo rate, RBI has also reduced the cash reserve ratio of banks which released ₹1.37 lakh crore liquidity. This, along with other measures, will see an infusion of ₹3.74 lakh crore into the banking system.
RBI has also allowed banks to defer payment of EMIs on home, car, personal loans as well as credit card dues for three months till May 31. Since non-payment will not lead to non-performing asset classification by banks, there will be no impact on credit score of the borrowers.

I think Indian businesses will also need some sort of support as well to help them deal with the havoc being wreaked by this pandemic and we will wait for that second wave of measures to help industry,” said Nisha Biswal, President of the U.S. India Business Council (USIBC) in an interview to The Hindu, adding that the USIBC is in a “two-way” conversation with the government on steps to mitigate economic impact on businesses, particularly those that serve as a “services hub” for the world.
In the wake of the PM’s announcement of a 21-day shutdown, analytical firms have expressed concerns over its impact on India’s GDP. While brokerage firm Barclay’s brought down the 2020 GDP forecast from 4.5% to 2.5% in the calendar year, Nomura Research said its estimates suggest that 75% of the economy will shut down due to the measure, and that there would be a slide in the GDP as well.
While lauding PM Modi for taking the “important and necessary step” of the lockdown, the USIBC called for more uniform implementation of the exemptions for essential services during the lockdown, which are being disrupted at present. “India is a services hub for the world. Virtually every data processing company has a back office interest in India. Major banks, insurance companies, payment companies, process transactions not only in India but in other countries. That’s a real challenge...The government has put these in essential services, but the challenge is in the implementation,” Ms. Biswal added.
She further added that the countries need to work together and coordinate their responses. “We need consistency in approaches. This pandemic has two big impacts. Health and safety of the population is one priority, but it is also breaking up the interconnected economy that is keeping us afloat…stocking markets and manufacturing, and for the economy to play that role.”
In addition, India’s fight against the pandemic would also require companies to be able to import necessary chemicals for pharmaceuticals, bring in testing kits and ventilator parts. “Other countries need to be able to support the supply chain. Our letter was to identify some of those issues, and ways in which businesses in India can continue to service the needs,” she said.
In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, the USIBC also pitched for a task force to be set up in the government to coordinate with industry groups regarding the resources, essential goods and services and technical capabilities that they can provide in responding to COVID-19.
 While Thursday’s announcement from the government was welcomed across various industry sectors, almost all sought similar sector-specific measures. “[The measures announced] will certainly entrust the faith of the vulnerable section of our society on the government and support them in dealing with the immediate concerns caused by COVID-19. We hope the government will also soon announce measures to support the automotive industry,” Rajan Wadhera, President, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said.
Likewise, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) said the Garib Kalyan Scheme was the need of the hour and the industry is “eagerly awaiting” the economic stimulus required for its revival. ",business
Marvel film star Evangeline Lilly apologises for insensitive comments on coronavirus fear,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/marvel-film-star-evangeline-lilly-apologises-for-insensitive-comments-on-coronavirus-fear/article31183448.ece,"Ant-Man and the Wasp actor Evangeline Lilly has tendered an apology over her “dismissive” and “arrogant” statement about social distancing in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.
The Marvel film star was severely criticised on social by many, including Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner and Maggie Grace, for saying that she won’t be going into self-quarantine as she values freedom over everything else.
 In a new post on Instagram, Lilly regretted her earlier statement and said she is practising social distancing now.
“I want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity I showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through COVID19. Grandparents, parents, children, sisters and brothers are dying, the world is rallying to find a way to stop this very real threat, and my ensuing silence has sent a dismissive, arrogant and cryptic message,” she posted.
“My direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic. I never meant to hurt you. When I wrote that post 10 days ago, I thought I was infusing calm into the hysteria. I can see now that I was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation,” the actor wrote.
 Lilly said she is saddened that so many people have lost their lives due to COVID-19.
“I am grieved by the ongoing loss of life, and the impossible decisions medical workers around the world must make as they treat those affected. I am concerned for our communities — small businesses and families living paycheck-to-paycheck — and I am trying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help.”
“Like many of you, I fear for the political aftermath of this pandemic, and I am praying for us all. At the same time, I am heartened by the beauty and humanity I see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time,” she added.
Last Week, Lilly, 40, shared that she dropped her kids off at a gymnastics camp and that “they all washed their hands before going in”. 
She accompanied the post with the hashtag “business as usual”, which did not go down well with many social media users.
 The actor later wrote in the comments section, “Some people value their lives over freedom, some people value freedom over their lives. We all make our choices. Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law for my comfort already, all in the name of a respiratory flu.” ",movies
"Celebrity messaging in the time of COVID-19: Some got it right, some very wrong",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/celebrity-messaging-in-the-time-of-covid-19-some-got-it-right-some-very-wrong/article31183291.ece,"Bollywood actors Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal were supposed to get married in April. Not only has the date now been pushed to later this year, the two are also self-isolated in their respective homes in Mumbai, and, like many people, have been keeping in touch over video call. 
It was one such free-flowing ‘Be my quarantine’ chat that they recorded at their respective ends that caught everybody’s attention. The sweet, personal vaartalaap (conversation), in which they talk about self-isolation, social distancing, not touching your face, washing your hands regularly and maintaining hygiene, became all the rage on Instagram, while effectively communicating the basics of the situation to the lay person. The spontaneous, unrehearsed attempt was also, as Fazal put it, to address the “weird depression that sets in when you are done watching content. All you want is to be close to people, relate to people,” he says.
Rant routine
Another such video by Anil Kapoor has him video-chatting with Anupam Kher, stressing on the need to maintain distance even from neighbours and close friends. Lyricist-writer-stand-up comic Varun Grover has been leveraging his stand-up routines to post “rant” videos to drill sense into misinformed people. That apart, he also treats it as a diary for himself. “It’s the world war of our times. The entire world is shut. It’s the first time the Olympics won’t be held since WW II. The Taj Mahal, Juhu beach and Siddhivinayak are all shut at the same time. It’s unimaginable that the Indian railway network could ever stop. These are very surreal times and I wanted to document them through my art,” he says.
With mobile phone cameras and social media platforms readily at their disposal, and with plenty of time on hand, celebrities and influencers — from Sonam and Suriya to Shah Rukh Khan and Kartik Aryan — are getting more socially conscious and creative to raise awareness of COVID-19. 
What makes the messaging drastically different in these critical times is the fact that the haloed stars, for once, are caught in the same situation as the hoi polloi. They are living the nightmare. “It has impacted everyone. Earlier, it wasn’t their story. Now it is personal to everyone,” says Suraja Kishore, CEO of advertising agency BBDO India. For instance, he says, actor Shefali Shah’s messages on Instagram, about quarantining her sons who have returned from universities abroad, are not just responsible but effective because she comes across as a mother more than a celebrity. “Parents and families vibe with it,” he says.







Moral responsibility
So, how exactly does star messaging play out in these critical times? And does it help? “If some positivity comes out of it, why not?” says Fazal. Star YouTuber Bhuvan Bam, whose “Time to be a Hero” video garnered over 480k views in less than 45 minutes of its release and has touched a million views at last count, says he felt it was his “moral responsibility to bust the myths around coronavirus circulating on WhatsApp”. It is necessary “in times like these,” he says. 
As Santosh Desai, CEO of Futurebrands, points out, “They [celebrities] have an audience and the ability to communicate in a direct way.” 
However, this huge reach, influence and captive audience comes with its pitfalls, especially when coupled with misinformation. Be it Mohanlal, talking about bacteria and viruses vanishing when people clap in unison, or Amitabh Bachchan tweeting superstitious mumbo-jumbo that he had to delete, or Rajinikanth’s misleading ‘Janata curfew’ message that had to be taken down by Twitter, the end result can be dangerous because diehard fans probably believe everything they say.
 
Grover has a few pointers on how to get it right — stick to facts, don’t alienate people, don’t bring in politics. “It’s about saving as many lives as we can,” he says. According to him it’s “the first global calamity in the time of social media, and of an unimaginable scale,” in which transmission of the correct information is key. “It’s an information war. The right information will save us, the wrong will endanger us.”






Shah Rukh Khan  






 Irony and sarcasm don’t work well in these confused times. Pointing out superstitions and myths can conversely amplify them. “One has to be wise with words because there’s a massive population out there... You have to say things in as simple a language as you can,” says Bam. 
The moral of the story? Keep it simple or keep quiet. “It’s a formidable task,” says Desai. “The stars also have to align their behaviour to what they are saying. You have to live what you are preaching. In that sense, it’s not just advertisement and there’s no leeway to go off script.” ",movies

Instead of 10a.m., a sneak peak of Ram Charan’s character from from S S Rajamouli’s next film RRR was unveiled at 4p.m. on Thursday. The magnum opus starring Ram Charan as Alluri Seetaramaraju and NTR as Komaram Bheem is titled Roudram Ranam Rudhiram in Telugu, Ratham Ranam Roudhiram in Tamil, and captioned ‘Rise Roar Revolt’ in English. 
True to the motion poster unveiled earlier this week that showed Ram Charan representing element fire and Jr NTR as water, the character introduction, with a voiceover by Jr NTR, gave a glimpse of young Alluri Seetaramaraju and what made him a fiery fighter.
 




 
Captioning the video as ‘Bheem for Ramaraju’ and promoting it as #BheemforRamaraju, Jr NTR’s voiceover (in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi) refers to Alluri Seetaramaraju as his elder brother.
Leading up to the video’s release was an interesting banter between Jr NTR, Ram Charan, Chiranjeevi and Rajamouli on Twitter that kept everyone entertained. On Thursday evening, NTR had tweeted that he will be unveiling the video to coincide with Ram Charan’s birthday on March 27, at 10a.m.

Telugu ‘comfort films’ to watch during the COVID-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/telugu-comfort-films-to-watch-during-lockdown/article31179418.ece,"None of us is used to a lockdown, but we know it needs to be done to break the COVID-19 chain and flatten the curve. While we work from home, we need something to lift our spirits. There are podcasts, e-books and audio books, and of course web series. But there’s something comforting about revisiting much-loved movies. If you’ve missed out on any of the older films, or the newer ones, this is the time to catch up. Here’s a mix of contemporary and older Telugu films to add some cheer:
Note: This is not an all-encompassing list. So don’t take offence and outrage if your favourite star’s movie isn’t listed.
Like good wine, these films keep getting better with time and merit repeat viewing with the family. The storylines offer a social commentary of an era, and the films have commendable performances and music that’s pleasing on the ears; these films are lessons in filmmaking as well.
Director K V Reddy’s Mayabazar (1957) is an eternal favourite and had an eclectic cast including Savitri, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, NT Rama Rao and S V Ranga Rao. Characters from ‘Sasirekha Parinayam’, the folk tale inspired by ‘Mahabharata’, became mortals that we could relate to.
While on the topic of Mayabazar, it’s imperative to mention director Nag Ashwin’s biopic of Savitri, Mahanati (2018). In this compelling biopic, the team managed to recreate iconic scenes from Mayabazar and a host of other Telugu films that starred Savitri. The casting was spot on, as Keerthy Suresh walked that fine line between mimicking and imbibing Savitri’s body language, and the charming Dulquer Salmaan portrayed Gemini Ganesan.
Many of director K Vishwanath’s films continue to endear generations of viewers. Among them, we would pick Sankarabharanam (1980), Sagara Sangamam (1983) and Swathi Muthyam (1986).

Muthyala Muggu (1975) and Pelli Pustakam (1991) among director Bapu’s films make for repeat viewing, and who can forget director Kamalakara Kameswara Rao’s Gundamma Katha (1962)?
A good dose of humour is welcome in times like these. Give those WhatsApp forwards a break and turn to the good old comedies. Jandhyala films such as Aha Naa Pellanta (1987) and Srivariki Premalekha (1984) could be your cup of tea, or if you want something from the later decades, revisit Manmadhudu (2002) for the comic banter between Nagarjuna and Brahmanandam.
There aren’t too many romantic comedies in Telugu cinema. Among the few we have had, director Nandini Reddy’s Ala Modalaindi (2011) and Tharun Bhascker’s Pellichoopulu (2016) guarantee good laughs.
Want more? Maruthi Dasari’s Bhale Bhale Magadivoy (2015) starring Nani and Lavanya Tripathi can add to the light-hearted fun.
In Mani Ratnam’s Geetanjali (1989), the characters played by Nagarjuna and Girija show us how to live with hope, and learn to smile, in times of adversity. Re-watch this film, soaking in all its nuances, and give in to Ilaiyaraaja’s lilting music once again. Ninne Pelladatha (1996) and Nuvvu Naaku Nachav (2001) are repeat worthy too.

In the last decade, it’s tough to think of a more entertainingly packaged romantic musical than Gautham Menon’s Ye Maya Chesave (2010). A R Rahman’s music still rings so fresh and it’s fun to watch the now real life couple Samantha and Naga Chaitanya from 10 years ago, as Jessi and Karthik.
And if you haven’t seen Indraganti Mohanakrishna’s romantic comedy drama Sammohanam (2018), tune in. Vivek Sagar’s music is the icing on the cake.
Telugu cinema has been guilty of producing mainstream films with an extra dash of masala. In the last few years, though we’ve sporadically seen newer filmmakers exploring concept-oriented films and doing away with formula (Venkatesh Maha’s brilliant Care of Kancharapalem is an example), there’s no wishing away the masala-laden entertainers, especially when their release is timed during festive occasions. Some of these films are great fun, so why not?

The latest guilty pleasure for many Telugu film buffs has been Trivikram Srinivas’s Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020). The basic plotline isn’t new but this film knew how to win over the audience with its characters (Allu Arjun as Buntu and Murali Sharma as Valmiki) and innovate within the masala format. For instance, the imaginatively choreographed action sequence, as the Srikakulam folk song ‘Sittarala Sirapadu’ played in the background.
Among the hugely entertaining films of the 90s, there’s Chiranjeevi’s Gang Leader (1991), Chantabbai (1986) and Nagarjuna’s Hello Brother (1994).
A few have broken the formula time and again and come up with new narratives, stunning the audience into watching something unexpected — Ram Gopal Varma’s action drama Shiva (1990), crime caper Kshana Kshanam (1991) and Chandrasekhar Yeleti’s thriller Aithe (2003). Singeetam Srinivasa Rao’s science fiction Aditya 369 (1991) is unlike any Balakrishna film and packs in good fun.
S S Rajamouli tops this category among contemporary directors. The showmanship was always there in his earlier movies but it kept getting bigger and better. Eega (2012) is huge fun, riding on an unbelievable idea of a housefly in revenge mode. The two Baahubali films (2015 and 2017) redefined larger-than-life cinema in the Indian context.

India coronavirus lockdown | Finance Ministry pulls up banks on shut branches,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-coronavirus-lockdown-finance-ministry-pulls-up-banks-on-shut-branches/article31187332.ece," The Union Finance Ministry has asked banks to explain why several branches are closed.
“In view of the novel coronavirus lockdown, the government is monitoring the functioning of bank branches across the country. Accordingly, the daily data on the number of bank branches (of all scheduled commercial banks in the country), which are open and functioning is being collected by Indian Banks Association (IBA), and monitored by Department of Financial Services,” the Ministry said in the communication to banks.
Coronavirus | Banks to provide only essential services
The Ministry cited the data and asked public sector banks to submit reasons on “why large number of branches are not functioning across the country”. On private banks, it has asked the IBA to compile reasons. 
The bank unions, however, cited the problems the staff faced in reaching the branches. 
According data submitted by banks to the Ministry, 1775 of the State Bank of India’s 22,029 branches are closed, 666 of Bank of Baroda’s 9,479 branches are shuttered as are 989 of Punjab National Bank’s 6,618 branches, 289 of Canara Bank’s 6,325 branches and 424 of 5,024 Bank of India branches.
In a communication to the banks earlier this week after the lockdown was announced, the IBA had said they could selectively keep their branches open after consultation with local State governments. Bank branches are now offering only essential services including deposits and withdrawals, and their working hours have also been shortened.

The communication from the Finance Ministry has, however, not gone down well with bank unions as they cited the problems employees face in reaching to branches due to the lockdown and obstruction by police.
“Now ensuing week branches will have to face rush at the counter due to salary disbursement & pension payment,” said Devidas Tuljapurkar General Secretary Maharashtra State Bank Employees Federation.

“Yesterday’s announcement of disbursement of subsidies through Jan Dhan accounts is also likely to result in a huge rush at the counters when maintaining required distance amongst customers & employees as against customers is not possible which will result in frustrating the very purpose of the lockdown. This is likely to put customers as also staff to a great risk. Government should find out the alternatives.” Mr Tuljapurkar added. ",economy
Liquidity floodgates opened,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/liquidity-floodgates-opened/article31186597.ece,"In a move to infuse sufficient liquidity into the banking system, the Reserve Bank of India has reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement by 100 bps, increased the cap for liquidity available under the marginal standing facility, and will auction long-term repo of ₹1 lakh crore. These three measures will infuse ₹3.74 lakh crore into the banking system.
The cash reserve ratio — the proportion of liabilities which a bank has to set aside as cash — has been reduced from 4% to 3%. The 100 bps reduction in CRR will free up ₹1.37 lakh crore liquidity for the banks. For State Bank of India, lowering of CRR will release ₹31,000 crore.
The minimum daily requirement of maintaining CRR balance has also been reduced to 80% from 90%, effective from the first day of the reporting fortnight beginning March 28, 2020. “This is a one-time dispensation available up to June 26, 2020,” the RBI said.
Banks do not earn any interest for maintaining CRR balance. With this reduction, they can deploy the liquidity in interest-earning assets.
RBI also increased liquidity available to banks under the marginal standing facility from 2% of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) to 3% with immediate effect. This measure will be applicable up to June 30, 2020. 
“This measure should provide comfort to the banking system by allowing it to avail [itself of] an additional ₹1,37,000 crore of liquidity under the LAF window in times of stress at the reduced MSF rate announced in the MPC’s resolution,” the RBI said.
The monetary policy committee reduced the repo rate by 75 bps to 4.4% and consequently the MSF rate was reduced to 4.65%.
Observing that large sell-offs in the domestic equity, bond and forex markets had intensified redemption pressures, the central bank decided to infuse ₹1 lakh crore through targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO). 
The RBI will conduct auctions of targeted term repos of up to three years’ tenor for a total of up to ₹1 lakh crore at a floating rate, linked to the policy repo rate. “Liquidity availed under the scheme by banks has to be deployed in investment grade corporate bonds, commercial paper and non-convertible debentures over and above the outstanding level of their investments in these bonds as on March 25, 2020,” the RBI said. 
RBI also said investments by banks under this facility would be classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25% of the total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio.",economy
Moody’s cuts India's GDP growth forecast to 2.5% ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/moodys-cuts-indias-gdp-growth-forecast-to-25/article31183734.ece,"Moody's Investor Service has slashed its GDP growth forecast for India to 2.5% in 2020 - a sharp drop from an earlier projection of 5.3%, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown.

The ratings agency expects the country's economy to recover in 2021, estimating a growth rate of 5.8%, but warned that uncertainty regarding the virus’s spread and containment makes it difficult to fully assess the economic toll of the crisis. India grew at 5% in 2019.
Globally, the world economy was facing an “unprecedented shock” and the G20 countries were likely to see an overall contraction of GDP by 0.5%, said Moody's Global Macro Outlook 2020-21, released on Friday. It projected that the G-20 GDP growth rate, which was 2.6% in 2019, is likely to recover to 3.2% in 2021.
At the low growth rate of 2.5% in 2020, India may see a sharp fall in incomes, further weighing on domestic demand and the pace of recovery in 2021. “In India, credit flow to the economy already remains severely hampered because of severe liquidity constraints in the bank and non-bank financial sectors,” said the report.
While advanced economies may see sharp contractions in their economies in 2020, it was emerging market countries such as India which may struggle with the recovery once the crisis was over, said the report.

“A general lack of social safety nets, weak ability to provide adequate support to businesses and households, and inherent weaknesses in many major emerging market countries will amplify the effects of the coronavirus-induced shock. Additionally, emerging market countries with relatively open capital markets remain vulnerable to risk-off financial market sentiment as the growth outlook deteriorates,” it said. “As a result, recoveries in many of the emerging market economies will likely be relatively more muted than those in advanced economies and China.”
The ongoing 21-day lockdown in India has brought business activity in most sectors of the economy to a halt and resulted in thousands of job losses. The Centre has announced a welfare package to provide support to the most vulnerable communities at this time.
However, Moody’s warned that, “Even in countries where governments are in a position to provide support through large and targeted measures, some small businesses and vulnerable individuals in less-stable jobs will likely experience severe financial distress.”
Globally, the ratings agency estimated that the U.S. economy would contract by 2% in 2020, while the Euro area would see a 2.2% contraction. China's economic growth rate was expected to slow to to 3.3%, although it was expected to recover to 6% in 2021.
However, a resurgence in new cases in areas which have seen some flattening of the curve was especially worrisome. “There are significant unknowns, such as how long the virus will take to be fully contained and, by extension, how long economic activity will remain disrupted,” said the report. “In particular, a sustained pullback in consumption and prolonged closures of businesses would hurt earnings, drive layoffs and weigh on sentiment. The longer these conditions persist, the more they would potentially feed self-sustaining recessionary dynamics, and expose existing vulnerabilities in the real economy and in financial sectors,” it added.",economy

The Revised Estimates had substantially lowered estimates of disinvestment receipts for the current financial year to ₹65,000 crore, from ₹1.05 lakh crore projected in the Budget.
The government has sold 74.49% stake in THDC for ₹7,500 crore and 100% in NEEPCO for ₹4,000 crore.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had in November 2019 given its in-principle approval for the sale of its stake in North Eastern Electric Power Corp (NEEPCO) and THDC India along with transfer of management control to NTPC.
Following this, the board of NTPC approved the said acquisition in January and competition watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) also cleared it in February.
“DIPAM completed two more strategic disinvestment transactions. GOI’s 74.49% stake in THDC at a consideration of ₹7,500 cr and 100% stake in NEEPCO at ₹4,000 cr has been disinvested in favour of NTPC,” secretary, DIPAM said in a tweet.

The government in the next financial year has set disinvestment target at ₹2.10 lakh crore, including ₹1.20 lakh crore from stake sale in central public sector enterprises (CPSEs).
The process for big-ticket strategic sale of Air India and BPCL has already set in motion and the sale is likely to be concluded in the next financial year beginning April.
In March last year, State-owned PFC had acquired the government’s 52.63% stake in REC for ₹14,500 crore.

“The RBI policy announcements are bold, decisive, compelling and with a humane touch in attenuating to the needs of the economy to fight through the pandemic. The large rate cut, the adjustment in capital conservation buffer, the moratorium on repayments and the bazooka of conventional CRR cut and unconventional liquidity measure of incentivising banks to support CP market all will help financial markets stabilise, lead to immediate rate transmission and address the credit needs of the real economy. The decision of allowing Indian Banks to participate in NDF market is a positive step in broadening the market participants and better rate discovery. Given that we are in exceptional times, RBI has played the role of championing the cause for the economy and financial system!” — Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
“The Monetary Policy Committee today announced a set of comprehensive measures to address liquidity, easing financial pressures on businesses and providing enough support to help the financial system battle the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Liquidity measures announced were to the tune of ₹3.74 lakh crore across three measures comprising Long Term Repo Operation (LTRO), CRR cut of 100 bps and the increase in marginal standing facility (MSF) to 3% of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). That is a large amount of liquidity injection into the financial system that should help financial institutions and flow of funds to the real economy.” — Shanti Ekambaram, Group President — Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank
“Given that the current lockdown is expected to have a negative impact on the cash flows of companies, the moratorium on repayments of term loans for a period of 3 months will help companies tide over this period. However, CII would urge that this period be extended further in case the impact of the virus outbreak lasts longer than expected. The RBI governor did well to provide the assurance that all instruments are on the table to protect the economy and the financial system from either an excessive downturn or volatility.” — Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII
“Expectations from RBI were riding very high on rate cut, moratorium and liquidity measures. RBI has delivered on every count. This will provide significant support to the market and economy. The small finance banks will see significant liquidity free u, which is critical to tide through the current challenges. While the measures were much needed but the markets will move now on how the Covid curve behaves in India. Longer shut downs will be detrimental to economy and the markets. Earlier recovery from lock down will mean a V shaped market recovery.” — Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities Limited
“RBI has announced all best possible praiseworthy measures to support banks and all sectors of economy to overcome ongoing adverse impact of COVID 19. Huge liquidity infusion of 3.74 Cr, 100 bps CRR cut, long term Repo auction, 3 months moratorium on loan repayment and deep Repo cut of 75 bps. Huge interest reduction to all Retail and home loans linked with Repo. Coordinated efforts of Government and RBI will help Indian Economy to come out of these challenging times”. — Deo Shankar Tripathi, MD and CEO of Aadhar Housing Finance
“RBI has effectively thrown a lifeline with its 3-month EMI moratorium and working capital interest forbearance. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all systems globally, and broken MSME supply chains across most sectors in India. RBI Governor Shaktikantha Das has made the right move by addressing the nation right away given the unprecedented economic reality that we are experiencing today. As the COVID-19 situation unfolds, our hope is they will continue to ease the economic burden on MSMEs who are the backbone of the Indian economy.”— Hardika Shah, Founder & CEO, Kinara Capital
“Allowing all banks and NBFCs to offer a 3-month moratorium on repayments of all term loans to their borrowers is a positive step. However, this being an optional move, its implementation has been left to the lending institutions.

 The comments, which came after a massive correction in banking stocks following the Yes Bank crisis and coronavirus outbreak, also urged depositors not to resort to panic withdrawals.
“Let me reiterate that the Indian banking system is safe and sound.”
“In the recent past, COVID-19 related volatility in the stock market has impacted share prices of banks as well, resulting in some panic withdrawal of deposits from a few private sector banks. It would be fallacious to link share prices to safety of deposits,” Mr. Das said.
Depositors of commercial banks including private sector banks need not worry on the safety of their funds, he added.
“I would, therefore, urge members of public as well as the public authorities, who have deposits in private sector banks, not to resort to any panic withdrawal of their funds,” Mr. Das said.
 It can be noted that a few states like Maharashtra had urged all the departments to pull out money from private sector banks despite previous communication from the RBI not to do so.
Yes Bank witnessed massive withdrawals ahead of being put under a moratorium by the RBI, but has been reporting normal activity since the restrictions removed on March 18. ",economy

Apart from increasing liquidity with steps such as reducing the cash reserve ratio, the RBI announced that banks are permitted to allow a three-month moratorium on payment of EMIs on all term loans that were outstanding on March 1.

Instead, he is in an apartment in Frankfurt.
The five-time World champion’s travel plans went haywire following the outbreak of the coronavirus. He had travelled to Germany to play in the Bundesliga chess.

Connecting Chennai and Frankfurt

Though he wasn’t playing, Anand had been kept busy by chess. He made his debut as a commentator during the Candidates chess tournament, the only high-profile sporting event taking place anywhere in the world till it was stopped on Thursday at the half-way mark at Yekaterinburg, as Russia decided to ground international flights.
 
In this exclusive interview, Anand tells The Hindu whether FIDE was right in going ahead with the Candidates (the tournament that will determine Magnus Carlsen’s challenger for the next World championship). He also spoke about life in Europe in the time of coronavirus, India’s response to the pandemic and the quality of chess on display at Yekaterinburg. Excerpts:
How is life in Germany, and the rest of Europe, in these hard times?
Here, everyone more or less maintains a certain social distance. You know, when you walk on street, if somebody comes across, you step aside so that you are at least a metre away. I feel they are dealing with the worst of infections now, at least statistics suggest that. They are holding up well. I have not seen anyone complain.
It is tough, but statistics are quite promising for Germany, with the caveat, of course, that nobody really knows how the disease evolves. This is a situation unlike anything we have faced before.
How do you spend your time at Frankfurt?
I block some time during the day for exercise. Before it gets too late in India, I check up on my wife Aruna and son Akhil through phone or video calls.
Do you think they did the right thing by going ahead with the Candidates as per schedule?
Yes. With hindsight, it looks questionable. But when they decided to go ahead with it, everything wasn't as clear as it is now. I feel globally the consensus on stopping everything and focusing on virus became evident only a week before the Candidates started. By the time many of the participants were in Yekaterinburg.
How did you find the experience of being a commentator?
I enjoyed it. I tried to approach like a chess fan and not as a former participant myself. I wanted to try and enjoy watching the experience of the strong players competing for the right to play in the World championship.
What do you think about the quality of chess at Yekaterinburg?
I feel it has been consistently high. There have been very few games that were decided by crass blunders. There have been lots of interesting, original ideas. And it was gripping stuff to watch. I think, in a way, it is curious that the participant who came late, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, is actually leading the tournament (along with Ian Nepomniachtchi).
Your thoughts on the impact of the virus on chess and other sports...
It looks like chess and the rest of the sports world would have to deal with a lot of cancellations.
I am really curious not only about sports but how the global economy is going to recover. We are so used to operating all the time that this year is going to be drastically different.
On how India has tackled the situation...
I think India has responded well. Clearly social distancing and lockdowns are the norm everywhere. Most countries are doing it. But we should understand that given the size of our country, this is necessary even though at the moment we don’t really know how bad the situation is or might be.
I feel the Indians have taken this generally well.
I am sure the government is working to procure all the equipment necessary.
Most of us like to socialise and be with friends.
That’s exactly the behaviour which can spread this.
So, we will have to practise isolation till the danger passes.",other sports

We are the world ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/we-are-the-world/article31171399.ece,"All conversations these days wind back to the one thing that’s on everyone’s mind and occupying all our news feeds: the virus. Yes, that one. Between frantically keeping up with the global numbers, finding ways to protect ourselves and others, it’s hard to find much mindspace for anything else.
The podcast space offers some respite from the high-pitched blame games on television and the sometimes confusing density of text. A search on listennotes.com for podcasts related to COVID-19 throws up some 174 results, most of which have been launched in March. There are also special daily shows introduced by regular broadcasters such as NPR and BBC (Corona Virus Daily and Corona Virus Newscast, respectively). Indian platforms Newslaundry and Suno India and mainstream news outlets too have dedicated substantial time and resources to episodes on the pandemic.
Take away
To cut through the sound clutter, here are a few shows that are worth taking a listen to. Even though these are U.S.-based, they’re plenty to take away for Indian audiences.
Don’t Touch Your Face from Foreign Policy, hosted by staffers James Palmer and Amy Mackinnon, launched on March 5 as a daily podcast that “tracks the crisis and explores what it means for people’s everyday lives.” The first episode in the series discussed the need for local solutions to the pandemic, and the importance of understanding local contexts even as we take lessons from what other countries are doing. Other episodes have looked at issues such as mental health (which is a popular theme recurring in other podcasts), conspiracy theories and misinformation, at-risk groups, and most recently (as of this writing), how media has covered the pandemic. In conversation with host Mackinnon, Roxanne Khamsi, science editor and former chief news editor of Nature Medicine, parses the nuances of coverage and where the media needs to be not only more careful in their use of language but also more critical of new research claims.
The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has become a reliable go-to site for many COVID-19 trackers, and their daily podcast, ‘Public Health on Call’, has since March 3 been addressing — in a comfortingly measured tone — some of the anxieties of the moment. Professors from the University weigh in on different aspects of the pandemic, from explaining what it means to “flatten the curve” to considering the human rights implications of restriction strategies.
Deep and fine
Epidemic, from Just Human Productions, launched a little earlier than the previous two, has infectious diseases specialist Dr. Celine Gounder engaging with invited guests on a range of issues related to the pandemic. Joining her on the podcast is Ronald Klain, former chief of staff to two American Vice Presidents (Al Gore and Joe Biden) who provides a macro-level planning and governance perspective. Despite the somewhat alarmist title of the podcast, the conversations provide “depth and texture” to the various questions that we are all asking, for instance, “Are the right people making the right decisions using the right science?”
Apart from these institutional podcasts, it would seem that everyone who is sequestered at home is taking to podcasting, as living with COVID-19 becomes an everyday struggle. 
From staying-at-home teenagers in New York to families in Germany to working-from-home techies in Ireland, there are a number of experiential podcasts that tell us we are not alone in these anxious times.

Plan B ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/plan-b/article31173464.ece,"North’s leap to slam was a bold move. It’s the kind of bid one might make if his team is trailing near the end of a match. It might create a swing that leads to a comeback victory. 
The easiest route to 12 tricks would be three club ruffs in dummy. West’s inspired trump lead prevented that. A 3-3 spade split combined with two club ruffs might also do it. Rather than just relying on that, South decided to see if dummy’s hearts could be established. 
South won the opening trump lead with dummy’s 10 and ruffed a heart with the ace of diamonds. He ruffed a club with dummy’s low diamond and ruffed another heart, this time with the king of diamonds. Declarer crossed to dummy with the ace of spades and led another heart. When East discarded a club, declarer did the same, allowing West to win the trick. This was a good play, as South would have lost trump control if he ruffed. West exited with a trump, which South was able to win with dummy’s nine, thanks to his foresight in ruffing hearts with high trumps. 
One more heart ruff established the suit. South drew the last trump and crossed to dummy with the king of spades to discard his remaining losers on the good hearts. Well played! ",society
Chennai’s fishmarkets are empty due to the COVID-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennais-fishmarkets-are-empty-due-to-the-covid-19-lockdown/article31191837.ece,"“Look, a man has just got off a car and is coming towards us,” exclaims K Kalyani, while she is on the phone with me. She has a stall at the Nochi Kuppan fish market. “What do you want?” she asks the customer, and the phone line soon fills up with noise. Kalyani abruptly cuts the call. It is only fair that she pays more attention to her customers these days than waste precious time talking to a journalist. For, with the 21-day lockdown to break the COVID-19 chain, every customer who comes by is crucial to her business.
Minutes before, the 44-year-old was in a chatty mood. “At Nochi Kuppam, we have all come to a decision that none of us will get more stock,” she said. “We are allowed to sell what we have at hand, but not to buy more.” I spoke to her last week and she had some freshwater prawns to sell. Kalyani usually gets her prawns from Pulicat, but due to vehicular restrictions, she was forced to source the prawns locally. Customers too, queued up in front of her, unlike their usually disorderly selves. “The police have marked lines with kolam powder so that there is a distance between each customer,” she added.
Her colleagues have set up their stalls as well, but are running out of fish. “We bought stock from some fibreboats that went to sea,” she explained. “By the end of today, I will have nothing to sell and will have to close down my stall.” This is going to be a tough phase for people like her. “But it had to be done,” says R Mayandi, a Kasimedu fisherman who owns a line-fishing boat. “I’m not going to sea; with the yearly State government fishing ban on mechanised boats set to start on April 5, looks like it will take a long while for us to go back to sea.”
Fisherman Vinoth Kumar from Odaikuppam says that his and two other fishing settlements in Besant Nagar have decided to stay away from fishing during the lockdown. “I have closed my shop too. This is a decision taken voluntarily after discussing with fishermen here. We don’t foresee any demand, nor can we home-deliver due to movement restrictions.” 
Kasimedu fishing harbour wears an unusually quiet look, according to MD Dhayalan, president, Indian Fisherman Association. “None of the boats are going to sea since we have been instructed by the Fisheries Department to not go,” he says. “Besides, all the boat workers are from Andhra Pradesh and places such as Thiruvannamalai and Gingee. They have gone back home.” On days before the Sunday curfew and the lockdown, people thronged the fish market at Kasimedu. He adds: “We got a good price too.”

Dating apps see rise in users during COVID-19 lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/dating-apps-see-rise-in-users-during-covid-19-lockdown/article31191764.ece,"“I used to be on all the dating apps till about six months ago, when I gave up because I had lost hope and was bored with the others,” says Tarana Reddy, a film producer based in Chennai. “But last week, I had nothing better to do, so I re-downloaded Hinge, just to see what was going on.”
On it, she found others who, like her, were back on the app because their social lives and physical interactions are on hold as cities around the world are going under lockdown. And they aren’t alone — dating apps like Hinge, Bumble and Tinder are seeing an increase in new users across the board, as more and more people hop aboard to escape the confines of their homes. Existing users, too, seem to be spending more time and effort in looking for a connection.
While most apps are waiting to see how the trends shift and settle over next week, Tinder has a few country-wise insights, for mid-March: “Daily messages are up 10-15% compared to the prior week in the US. In places like Italy and Spain, we saw increases by up to 25% in daily conversation as compared to the week prior. Conversation length was up anywhere from 10 to 30% as compared to February in places like Europe and South East Asia,” says a Tinder spokesperson over email.
But longer conversations don’t necessarily mean better ones. As Tarana somewhat sardonically points out, just because someone is under lockdown, it does not mean they suddenly turn funnier or more interesting. “A couple of them have even come up with quarantine-related pickup lines,” she says, sounding distinctly unimpressed. Not surprising, considering the cringe-worthy ones we have come across, like, ‘Hey there, are you the vaccine? Because the whole world is chasing you.’
Funnily enough, Tinder’s top bios have also changed from the usual “wanderlust”- and “sapiosexual”-studded statements, to phrases like “stay home”, “be safe”, “social distancing”, “how are you”, and “wash your hands”.
Tinder is tweaking its features like Passport, which allows users to match with people in different destinations around the globe, regardless of where they are currently located. “Tinder’s Passport is currently available as one feature within Tinder Plus and Gold subscriptions. However, in the next iOS and Android releases, which we anticipate being around the end of March, the Passport feature will become free for everyone,” says a company statement.
In sharp contrast are the few users who don’t see the point of going online while isolating, no matter what part of the world they are in, since there aren’t high chances of it leading to a real date. Akshat Pradhan, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is currently in isolation at home in Pune. “I will be in self-isolation for two weeks now. I was on Tinder and Hinge, but haven’t used it for the past week. I probably won’t be trying them for a month at least,” he says.
For the others, these dire times have not made the interactions any more ardent — just more sporadic and half-hearted, if Tarana’s experience is anything to go by. “I’m not the best at texting… I text when I am free, and if something comes up, I forget to. So the people I have matched with are getting a little passive aggressive about it. They say, ‘We’re under quarantine; how busy could you be?’”
Many, like Indian expatriate Payal Kohbragade, see these apps as a means for some much-needed change of pace. Payal, who moved to Germany in February and is now under lockdown with five housemates, says, “I don’t want to talk to the same people over and over again, like roommates and family. Talking to someone new on the app helps break the monotony of our repetitive lives.” Of course, some changes have to be accommodated, “We meet on e-coffee dates instead, through video chat.”
Her last real date was about a week ago, when they decided to take a stroll around a park instead of sitting at a café. “We wanted to avoid closed, crowded spaces, and also kept the minimal personal distance from each other throughout,” she recalls with a laugh.
Not all lovebirds feel jaded, however. A good example is the Love Is Blind Instagram page by New York-based roommates Thi Q Lam and Rance Nix. The duo, who have been trying to keep six feet away from each other in their New York apartment, are posting photos of various couples, who are keeping each other safe through social distancing even in the confines of their homes. And then there are apps like Quarantine Chat, which are enabling strangers all over the world to chat. Innovations like these are likely to keep coming up, since, as Payal says, “it just helps to talk to someone new.”

State of efficiency: How Kerala has handled the coronavirus crisis,https://www.thehindu.com/society/state-of-efficiency-how-kerala-has-handled-the-crisis/article31181276.ece,"""Understand Kerala through Covid,” public policy professional Balakrishnan M. tweeted on March 20, with an image of two masked policemen on a bike carrying unusual items — a coconut spadix or flower and a big, green, braided coconut leaf. 
They were on an errand. Like their counterparts in other parts of Kerala, Niraz K.T. and Umesh U.P., beat cops at Kasaba Janamaithri station in Kozhikode were checking on people placed in home quarantine. One such person was Anand Ramaswamy, a Dubai-based banker. His mother had died, and he urgently needed to buy some things for the post-funeral rituals. He could not step out and no autorickshaw would home-deliver anything to him. So, the two policemen pitched in, buying what he needed. Niraz says he has also been delivering medicine and food to other quarantined people who stay alone.

For Balakrishnan, the incident is illustrative of Kerala’s communal amity and people-friendly policing.
“Exceptional times call for exceptional thoughts,” said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a videoconference he held on March 25, a day after Kerala went into total lockdown. As he instructed officials to make elaborate arrangements to ensure everyone had access to food, medicine and healthcare, his instinctive crisis management skills were evident. Community kitchens, which had fed thousands during the floods, would make a comeback, he announced. And food would be delivered free to the needy.

The key to Kerala’s extraordinary efficiency during the pandemic is attention to detail. Meticulous planning has gone into food and medical care strategies, ensuring that they cover every section of the populace — from the elderly to low-income groups, from migrant workers to terminally ill people, from fishermen to farmers. Systems are in place to regulate public movement, freight transport and the movement of essential supplies. Home deliveries have been given a leg-up. Milma, the State’s milk cooperative, has launched a delivery app, while the State-run Horticorp is set to follow suit with vegetables. The Catholic Church offered its hospitals up for COVID-19 cases. District administrations have begun to take over abandoned private hospitals and other buildings with bath-attached rooms to function as care centres.
 The first State to record a positive patient, Kerala also started tracking early on. Training for healthcare staff was going on and surveillance at international airports on January 23, as soon as alerts came in from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Kerala node of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) immediately activated district surveillance units.

Past experience
The State has drawn heavily on its experience of fighting Nipah. At that time, it had launched a contact-tracing exercise, which stood it in good stead now. Helpdesks were quickly set up at airports and passengers asked to fill declaration forms even before landing. Just as screening at airports was being ramped up, a couple travelling from Italy, which had by then become the epicentre of the pandemic, slipped through the net and reached Ranni in Pathanamthitta, triggering Kerala’s second wave of infection. “They were tracked down after a doctor questioned their neighbours who showed up with COVID-19 symptoms. It required a bit of hard talking to get them to hospital,” says Health Minister K.K. Shailaja.

The Pathanamthitta administration under collector P.B. Nooh launched a massive exercise to unearth patient clusters. They used Asha, Anganwadi and Kudumbashree workers, healthcare professionals and residents’ associations besides location-tracking technology to create spatio-temporal maps for retracing patients’ movements. “It was scaled up with the National Health Mission at the State-level to unearth contacts of those who defied home quarantine and tested positive,” says Dr. Amar Fettle, State nodal officer for public health emergencies. In north Kerala, police teams used geofencing to enforce quarantine.

Kerala’s battle against zoonotic diseases




 

Kerala’s battle against zoonotic diseases

As the days went by, Kerala’s surveillance net nearly burst at the seams — covering some 1.02 lakh people. Symptomatic cases were shifted to isolation facilities at hospitals across the State. The government launched a huge ‘break the chain’ campaign promoting social distancing, hand hygiene and work-from-home. Multilingual information material was disseminated everywhere.Companies, voluntary organisations, even prisons got down to making affordable sanitisers and masks and setting washbasins at busy junctions. 
Nerve-centre
 The State control room where 18 subdivisions — for surveillance, contact-tracing, transportation, testing, ambulances etc. — converge, became the nerve-centre. As Fettle explains, at each district control rooms, a ward member, an Asha worker and a police officer teamed up to attend to quarantined patients. Simultaneously, the State’s testing capacity was augmented, with four centres added (over 5,000 tests done so far), and the procurement of medical supplies was accelerated. In a single day, 276 doctors were recruited from the PSC rank list, with similar plans in the pipeline for paramedical staff. Importantly, to ease the load on healthcare personnel, they were divided into three alternating teams, so that each team could get enough rest. In addition, the government recently announced the creation of a war room at the State secretariat with a Principal Secretary at its helm and five senior IAS officers overseeing its operations in turn. 
In a highly progressive move, 626 councillors were deployed to safeguard the mental health of the quarantined. A 24x7 Disha call centre was activated for COVID-19 with six lines, soon growing to 30 lines that had responded to and mapped 35,826 calls until 5 p.m. on Thursday.
The Chief Minister unfailingly held elaborate daily briefings each evening, sharing facts, figures, plans and concerns, using audio and video conferences with administrators and people’s representatives. The committee members and multi-agency officials communicate among themselves with Zoom video chat. “We’ve done rather well for a small State. There’s an open and dynamic relationship between a government that’s responsive to criticism, a society that’s aware, and the media,” says Dr. K.P. Aravindan, retired professor of pathology and former president of Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad.

Game changer 
 Public health expert Dr. B. Ekbal attributes it to the decentralisation of governance in 1996: “It was a game-changer for primary health centres up to district hospitals, whose governance was handed over to local bodies.” Under the 2006 government, this infrastructure leapfrogged, and under the present government’s Aardram mission, all healthcare facilities were given better hygiene and amenities. “If about 28% of people were using government hospitals between 1996 and 2000, it is 40% now,” says Ekbal. In all this, there’s enormous community participation. “We thus have the social capital to tide over the COVID-19 crisis,” he says. “We also have academic capital in the form of high-profile health experts.” The challenges for Kerala lie elsewhere: the high comorbidity of the population, the high percentage of the elderly, and the difficulty in asking a socially active population to confine themselves at home.
Just before the lockdown, Vijayan announced a relief package of ₹20,000 crore. This included arrears due to contractors, loans for Kudumbashree women, pensions for those not under social security schemes, a cumulative payment of two-month social security pensions, heavily subsidised meals and a rural employment guarantee scheme. “The fiscal package has sought to put money in people’s hands, addressing the critical question of demand. But the mark of this pandemic is that it has disrupted supply as well. If the crisis is prolonged, the State may have to chip in to take care of large chunks of manufacturing and production,” forecasts R. Ramkumar, professor of economics at TISS in Mumbai.
Is Kerala ready for what promises to be a long-haul battle? Vijayan is unfazed and says with characteristic calmness: “The government will be at the vanguard.”

Telecom companies to opt for EMI moratorium,https://www.thehindu.com/business/telecom-companies-to-opt-for-emi-moratorium/article31194858.ece,"Debt-ridden telecom operators are likely to opt for three-month moratorium to avoid cash crunch during the lockdown, industry body COAI said on Saturday.
The telecom operators have spoken in favour of raising mobile call and internet rates at the earliest, however, they will keep the prices stable during the lockdown period, COAI DG Rajan S. Mathews told PTI.
“There is debt of around ₹1.6-2 lakh crore that telecom operators owe to Indian banks. They will opt for three-month moratorium in loan repayment to help them maintain cash flow. It is a relief for them,” Mr. Mathews said.
The RBI on Friday allowed banks to put on hold EMI payments on all term loans for three months, slashed the cost of fresh borrowing by cutting policy interest rate by steepest in more than 11 years and infused a massive Rs 3.74 lakh crore liquidity as it joined the efforts of the government to counter the economic fallout of coronavirus pandemic.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) also allayed fear of hike in tariff by the telecom operators. “Telecom companies understand market situation. They will keep tariff stable for now,” Mr. Mathews said. Telecom operators have been asking for fixing minimum tariff for call and data rates. Vodafone Idea has suggested that the minimum rates should be fixed starting April 1, 2020.
Mobile subscribers get access to 4G data at a price as low as Rs 3.5 per GB but if the floor price is fixed as demanded by telecom operators, mobile internet prices will rise 5-10 times from the current level.
 Debt-ridden Vodafone Idea has proposed that the minimum price of data should be fixed at Rs 35 per GB, Bharti Airtel has proposed minimum price of Rs 30 per GB for low data users and Reliance Jio wants it to be hiked gradually to Rs 20 per GB. ",business
Net traffic rises by 30% post lockdown: COAI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/net-traffic-rises-by-30-post-lockdown-coai/article31194637.ece,"India’s Internet consumption has gone up dramatically as net traffic witnessed a 30% spike post lockdown, leading to a sudden choke in the telecom network across the country, said Rajan Mathews, Director General at Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).
“We see a sudden and unprecedented countrywide spike in demand for bandwidth, especially after the lockdown, with millions of professionals started working from home and their children and other children playing online games, watching videos and movies online,” he told The Hindu.
Tech capital Bengaluru reported a huge, almost 100%, spike in net traffic, said top official of a telecom firm, who did not wish to be named.
Responding to a query on the need for additional spectrum, Mr. Mathews said COAI had asked telecom and internet service providers (ISPs) to individually approach the Department of Telecom for additional allocation of spectrum.
“It is up to individual telcos to ask for additional spectrum, depending on scientific reasons and economic viability. They need to be very specific why they need more spectrum, where they need and how do they justify their requirements. As of now, no real-time data is available on choke points, although there are a plenty of such points.”
According to Mr. Mathews, many a time, networks are close to crashing and therefore COAI had advised electronic content providers, OTTs and television channels to reduce the density of the content.""We don't require high resolution content for basic viewing of news and entertainment, at least at this point of time, ""he opined.As a word of caution from COAI, Mr Mathews said individual internet users, including kids, have a weighty responsibility towards reducing the current stress on telecom/internet networks.
“Customers must avoid live streaming, instead download videos and movies. This would ease the pressure on the networks. Behave responsibly and avoid unwanted uploads, downloads and social media forwards. Internet is the only cord that currently connects the county and allows us play and work, "" he added.",business

"Rise in TV viewership, courtesy COVID-19",https://www.thehindu.com/business/rise-in-tv-viewership-courtesy-covid-19/article31194596.ece,"The work-from-home directive after the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to a jump in television viewership across the country.
As per the latest report by BARC-Nielsen India, the consumption of television content has increased by over 72 billion viewing minutes, leading to an 8% jump in the period from March 14-20 compared to the last three weeks of January. In urban India, the viewership in week 11 of 2020, around the time when companies announced work-from-home, was the second-highest since 2015. Viewership has risen by 8% among men, 9% among women and 20% among children.
The average time spent per viewer per day now stands at 3 hours 51 minutes, showing a 2% rise, as per BARC-Nielsen India data.
The growth has been driven by a 20% increase in daytime viewership at an all-India level. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s March 24 address on ‘complete lockdown’ was the most viewed event, with the number of viewers surpassing the IPL Finals (133 million), at 197 million.

Merger won’t lead to closure of even one branch: Indian Bank ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/merger-wont-lead-to-closure-of-even-one-branch-indian-bank/article31194587.ece,"The amalgamation of public sector lender Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank from April 1 will not lead to the closure of even a single branch, Padmaja Chunduru, managing director and chief executive officer, Indian Bank, said.
“The amalgamation process is on and we have gone far in this issue. The amalgamated entity will be called Indian Bank,” she said.
According to Ms. Chunduru, regular customers may not see any visible change on day one. The change in signage and display boards at Allahabad Bank will be done after a few days due to logistics issue. She said that Indian Bank had wide presence in the South and lesser in the North, which was vice-versa for Allahabad Bank.
As of December 2019, on a pan-India basis, Allahabad Bank had 3,175 branches and the average business per branch was ₹116.80 crore. Indian Bank has 2,890 branches, including three overseas branches. The number of clients will increase to 11 crore. The amalgamation might see the merger of zonal offices in Lucknow and Kanpur to cut administrative costs, she said. “Our goal is to ensure that minimum services are not denied to our customers from day one. Since both banks are on the same technology platform we don’t foresee any problem,” she said. 
On the impact of COVID-19, she said: “Our people have been working with minimum staff strength at some branches and others from home. We have contributed a day’s salary to the PM Relief Fund. Moreover, we have come out with five different loans for our customers.” “Customers need not have to come to the branches for getting loans sanctioned. It can be done online. Disbursements will also be done online. In the case of bigger loans, signing of documents has to be done physically at branches or at their place,” she said.
As only four days are left for the amalgamation, staffers are working round-the-clock and even during the weekend to see to it that the process goes through easily, another official said.

“This agreement comes into force with immediate effect,” P. Raveendran, chairman, ChPT, said. “Our immediate focus is to utilise the existing capacity in ChPT to the maximum and carry out expansion in KPL. Our next target is to achieve cargo handling of 100 million tonnes in the coming years.”
Soon after remitting the amount, he said both ports would operate as different entities for the betterment of exim trade — KPL as corporate firm and ChPT as trust. Both ports would be in a better position to meet competition from private players such as Adani’s Kattupalli Port and Krishnapatnam Port. ChPT will continue to handle clean cargo such as containers, cars, liquid cargo, cruise and passenger traffic, while KPL will create additional capacity for all other types of bulk, dry and liquid cargo. “Our combined effort will be to maximise cargo throughput. For the past few years, ChPT has been handling over 50 million tonnes of cargo, and KPL about 35 million.
 It will take at least 2 to 3 years to reach 100 million tonnes, due to COVID-19,” he said. “In ChPT, we can’t go in for expansion due to thick population, traffic bottlenecks and the ban on handling dusty cargoes such as coal and iron ore.

Chennai Corporation removes quarantine sticker from Kamal Haasan’s Alwarpet residence ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chennai-corporation-removes-quarantine-sticker-from-kamal-haasans-alwarpet-residence/article31190916.ece,"
Chennai Corporation, on Saturday, removed home quarantine stickers from the residence of actor Kamal Haasan, after a few workers of the health department had pasted the stickers based on an old address in a passport, as received from immigration authorities.
Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash instructed health officials to remove the sticker from the actor’s Alwarpet residence on Saturday. “Our staff pasted the quarantine sticker at Kamal Haasan residence because actor Gautami has returned from Dubai recently and her passport has this address,” he explained later.
Actor Gautami is reportedly currently residing in Sholinganallur zone in the southern region of the city, according to Chennai Corporation sources.
Chennai Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Health) Madusudhan Reddy said, “The Corporation received the address from the airport. It is based on the address given in the passport of actor Gautami, who travelled abroad recently. Our people ended up going and pasting the quarantine stickers at the address in Alwarpet given in the passport. We have traced the present address of actor Gautami in Sholinganallur,” said Mr. Reddy. The health department of Chennai Corporation will ask actor Gautami to be on home quarantine, officials said.
In the quarantine sticker pasted, the officials had mentioned a quarantine period from March 10 to April 6.
Chennai Corporation has collected the data of persons who returned from abroad from immigration authorities and asked them to be on home quarantine. But many of the addresses are outdated, primarily on account of people shifting residences.
According to estimates, less than 51% of the residents in Chennai own houses in the city. Many of residents who have passports are likely to have shifted residences. Chennai Corporation officials have started tracing the current address of residents who have travelled abroad.
In a statement, Kamal Haasan, actor and president of Makkal Needhi Maiam, said, “To all those who are concerned. A big thank you for your love. Based on the notice stuck outside my house, news has been spread saying that I have been quarantined. But, most of you already know that I have not been living there for the past few years and the Makkal Needhi Maiam party office has been functioning from there. So, the news that I have been quarantined is not true. As a precautionary measure, I have undertaken social distancing as I requested the public too. I would again reemphasise all of us to undertake social distancing as a precautionary measure. I also request all news agencies to verify news before breaking it so that fake news does not get spread.” ",movies

The actor, who made it big with the hit film Kirik Party, was also one of the most popular participants of Bigg Boss Kannada Season 7. He lived in the house for 14 weeks for the show and now is locked up at his home. “The difference is that in Bigg Boss, we were a group of people, working, cooking, doing the various tasks we were assigned. Now we are living by ourselves, in fear and anxiety,” says the actor who had a good 2019. Chemistry Of Kariyappa, where he plays a leading man was a hit and the year ended with another blockbuster, Avane Sriman Narayana, where he shares the screen with Rakshit Shetty.
His next solo venture, Mangalwara Raja Dina, was supposed to release this month, but the production team has stalled the release, due to Covid-19.
Yet, the actor stays positive. “These are difficult times. Even we actors should first think of lives rather than just fame and films. Lives are more important now.”
Though Chandan has signed a couple of films, he believes this is “not the right time to talk about it as there are more urgent concerns for everyone. Earlier this year we read about this virus creating havoc in China. Now it has reached our country. I don’t think any one imagined that we all could be locked down in our homes like this. But who can stand the fury of nature? I feel this is a wake up call from nature telling each of us to change our lifestyle and respect it. This is also a warning telling us to take care of ourselves and our environment.”
Being an active theatre person, this lock-down has taken its toll on the actor. “Theatre is a social activity. Sadly, we cannot meet.” Chandan says he and a group of theatre artistes from Bengaluru and Delhi have started an online theatre activity called, WeMovetheatre on FaceBook.
“This was started on World Theatre Day. Anyone can join us online and read out a line or a part from their favourite play, make a two-minute video of it and post it on We MoveTheatre page. We will choose a particular day and host all these videos on our FB page. This is our way of keeping ourselves involved. We are all social beings and cannot live in isolation. This is our small initiative to keep some theatre activity alive within the walls of our homes using online platforms.”",movies
‘Maska’ movie review: Saccharine sweet and cloyingly safe,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/maska-movie-review-saccharine-sweet-and-cloyingly-safe/article31190495.ece,"There’s a scene in Maska where the lead Rumi (Prit Kamani) is ticked off by a judge, Boman Irani (playing himself) in an acting competition. All for trying too hard to act — zyada hi mehnat (don’t overdo it), as he puts it. The film — about Rumi wanting to let go of his family legacy in order to become an actor — is also something like that. The well-meaning tribute to Mumbai’s iconic Irani cafés, is sweet but cloyingly so. The homage to the Parsi community gets too affected and contrived than spontaneous, and prefers to remain on the surface instead of taking a deep dive. 
No wonder for a long stretch at the start there is a sense of disconnect, whether it is with individuals or their relationships with each other. Manisha Koirala plays Diana, Rumi's mother, with daintily over-the-top eccentricity (can any Parsi not be done that way?) Or, for that matter Javed Jaffrey as the late father Rustom. When will portraying Parsis go beyond accents and catch phrases? The Punjabiyat of Rumi's girlfriend Mallika Chopra (Nikita Dutta) feels just as practiced. Kamani comes up with a sincere turn but its Abhishek Banerjee in a walk-on role as a casting director who livens things up.
MaskaDirector: Neeraj UdhwaniCast: Manisha Koirala, Prit Kamani, Javed Jaffrey, Nikita Dutta, Shirley SetiaStoryline: Young Rumi wants to let go of his family legacy to pursue his dream of becoming an actorRun time: 1 hour 51 minutes
Things take a heartwarming turn somewhere in the middle as Rumi battles between café and career but soon keels over to far-out sentimentality. Eventually, my big grouse with the film is that it opts for the convenience and comfort of the conventional than the uncertainty, trials and tribulations of the radical. Be it home, family and legacy, dreams and calling or even when it comes to matters of heart. It opts for the straight and the narrow and plays too safe. Why does preserving history have to be a burden for the future? Why can’t your heritage and individual identity co-exist? Why can't dreams be realigned better with reality?
In these home-bound times, the film does leave you feeling nostalgic for old Mumbai houses you used to encounter on walks. Most of all, it ignites a craving for those soft buns slathered with mounds of butter and the extra sweet tea at Irani cafés. And also those small cups of Bournvita, tea and coffee sold on cycle-carts late into the night and the wee hours of the morning in a city that never sleeps. Rather never used to sleep. Hope it soon wakes up again.

From last August, the goverment had made it mandatory for discoms to issue a Letter of Credit to get power supply from gencos. Besides, discoms were given an option to get power supply on single day advanced payment.
This was done in view of the mounting outstanding dues of discoms towards gencos.

For ensuring uninterrupted power supply, the Power Ministry has also announced that payment security will be reduced by 50%.
According to a statement by the Ministry, directions are issued to power regulator CERC to provide three-month moratorium to discoms to make payment to gencos (generating companies) and transmission utilities. Also, there will be no penalty on late payment.

In order to maintain the continuity of supply of coal by domestic coal companies and transportation by railways, the Ministry is in touch with the ministries concerned.
Due to the lockdown, consumers are unable to pay their dues to discoms.
This has affected the liquidity position of discoms, thereby impairing their ability to pay to the generating and transmission companies.
In this context, Mr. Singh has approved significant relief measures for the power sector.

How population size shapes evolution patterns in E. coli,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-population-size-shapes-evolution-patterns-in-e-coli/article31192824.ece,"Studying cultures of E. coli bacteria, a group of evolutionary biologists from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, has found that the population size determines the kind of fitness trade-offs the microbes adopt. Fitness trade-off may be understood in the following manner: Organisms do not have the capacity to maximise all their functions at the same time. Often when they enhance one function, another function suffers, or when they adapt to survive well in one environment, they cannot survive or reproduce well in another environments. This is called a fitness trade-off. This concept has been used by evolutionary biologists to explain why species prefer one environment to another.
There are several ways in which the concept of fitness trade-off originates. Evolution causes some organisms to be generalists, by which it is meant that they can survive in different environments, and basically they will have an tolerable level of fitness in all environments. The other option is they evolve into specialists, where the organism will have a high degree of fitness in a particular environment while having low fitness in other environments. An example of this is in the context of antibiotic resistance – generalists tolerate a wide range of distinct antibiotics (for example, multidrug resistant bacteria). On the other hand, specialist bacteria have to show a fitness trade-off. They resist one antibiotic (for instance, rifampicin) but become susceptible to another (for instance, tetracycline). From the example itself, it is clear that understanding how evolution brings about difference between specialists and generalists, for instance, is very important.
The study shows that large populations tend to evolve into specialists, exercising fitness trade-offs, whereas small populations evolve into generalists. 
“Ours is the first study to demonstrate a relationship between population size and fitness trade-offs and the results are important in understanding the population genetics of ecological specialization and vulnerability to environmental changes,” says Sutirth Dey of IISER Pune’s Department of Biological Sciences and the corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Heredity.
The study experimentally affirms the link between population size and evolution of fitness trade-offs. Apart from this there are practical implications. An example is described by Prof. Dey: “Owing to their higher extent of specialisation, larger populations can become more vulnerable to sudden changes in the environment.”
If the environment abruptly shifts between two states that show fitness trade-offs with each other, then populations with a history of evolution at larger numbers would be at a greater disadvantage than historically smaller populations. “For example, costs of antimicrobial resistance are expected to check the spread of resistant microbes if antimicrobials are removed abruptly from the environments. Moreover, pathogens are also expected to experience fitness trade-offs when they migrate across different hosts,” explains Prof. Dey.
The group next plans to study the response in fluctuating environments. “We are now studying more complex links between population size and trade-offs, combining fitness data with population genomics, in both constant and fluctuating environments,” says Prof. Dey.",science
Silent spread of novel coronavirus in Italy went undetected for weeks ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/silent-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-in-italy-went-undetected-for-weeks/article31192774.ece,"Italy reported its first laboratory-confirmed case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on February 20. But according to a study posted in a preprint repository arXiv, people appear to have been infected in early January and started showing symptoms by January 14. There apparently seems to have been a silent spread of the virus in the community for nearly 50 days.
By the time the first case was reported, the virus had already spread to most areas in southern Lombardy. Lombardy region, a district of 10 million, is the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy. So a day after the first case was reported, 28 more cases were confirmed, confirming the silent spread of the virus in the community.
Contact tracing and testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposures to positive cases helped uncover the ongoing transmission prior to the laboratory confirmation of the first case. 
The median age of people infected by the virus is 69 years and 47% of people who were infected required hospitalisation, of which 18% required intensive care. Each infected person spread it to 3.1 people, which started decreasing by end of the third week of February. The time between successive cases in the transmission chain, otherwise called as serial interval, was 6.6 days. “We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic,” the authors say in the preprint. Manuscripts posted on preprint servers are yet to be peer-reviewed.
“The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon,” the authors write. “Aggressive containment strategies are required to control COVID19 spread.” 
If there were just 530 cases on February 28, it increased to 5,830 by March 8. By early March, cases were reported from several areas in Lombardy region, a district of 10 million, which is the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy. As on March 26, there have been 74,386 cases, which is very close to China’s (81,782), and 7,503 deaths, which is the highest in the world. 
The authors collected epidemiological data through standardised interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. The information gathered included dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalisation and contact tracing. The epidemiological analyses were carried out on 5,830 confirmed cases during the period January 14 and March 8.
Contrary to what one might imagine, there has been “almost immediate initial response” by the Regional Health System. The focus was to collect epidemiological data and perform model-based predictions, increase in testing and providing hospital assistance for affected subjects.
The authors say that efforts were taken to limit the spread through contact tracing and isolation. Despite these efforts taken quickly, the number of new cases kept rising steadily leading to “rapid saturation of the health emergency system with a progressive difficulty” in treating COVID-19 patients.",science
Strike at the spike and win the war ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/strike-at-the-spike-and-win-the-war/article31192763.ece,"During the last six weeks, a series of research papers have appeared that offer medical solutions to defeat the life-threatening coronavirus infection - COVID 19. These are apart from the attempts to produce a protective vaccine against it.
The picture of how the novel coronavirus (scientists also call it SARS-CoV-2) looks is by now familiar to all of us (see the picture above). It is a roundish ball with spikes covering its entire body. These spikes, which are the business end of the virus, are made up of a glycoprotein, and the detailed structure of the spike protein and how it helps in entering the host (what an unwelcome name! but scientists are polite people) cell of the infected individual is seen by a Seattle-based group, using cryo-electron microscopy (https://doi.org/2020.02.19.956851,) and also in the journal Cell < cell.doi.10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058>. The spike protein recognises a specific enzyme called ACE2 on the cell surface, kills its activity and enters the host cell, and wreaks damage.
Go back in literature, and one finds that this activity of the novel coronavirus is actually a historical one. People have studied the catastrophe caused in 1918 by the Spanish Flu pandemic, wherein millions died. The patients suffered severe lung damage, pneumonia, and acute respiratory syndrome, which has recently been seen again in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the pathogen named SARS (called SARS-CoV coronary virus). Research here showed that the enzyme called Angiotensin Converting Enzyme or ACE2 fights against the viral attack and protects against damage (see; “good ACE, bad ACE do battle in lung injury, SARS” https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0805-821, and also that ACE2 is beneficial for hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Tikellis C, Thomas MC. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Is a Key Modulator of the Renin Angiotensin System in Health and Disease., International Journal of Peptide Research 2012, doi:10.1155/2012/256294). 
Hence this repeated request by public health officials to senior citizens across the world, and to those with these problems to stay safe at home.
Most recently, a very important paper appeared from the Wuhan-based CAS lab for special pathogens, which revealed the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, its entry through deactivating ACE2 of the affected individual, plus another important point, namely, treatment of the affected by using the serum of a recently recovered patient. (This is important since it was shown as early as in 2006 by Liu and coworkers, < https://doi.org/10.1086/500469> when the SARS infected the world, treating the affected with the sera of recovered patients offered them the protective antibody IgG.). Hence the suggestion made across the world by some scientists that this can be followed in the present instance of COVID 19, too.
About the same time that this Wuhan work came about, comes another paper in the journal Cell from Leibniz, Germany (https://doi.org/10.1016.j.cel.2020.02.052), where the group confirmed that the novel coronavirus’ cell entry depends not only of ACE2 but another molecule (and enzyme) in the host cell, called TMPRSS2. They suggest further that the latter can be blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor! This is an important advance, since we may now look for such blocking molecules as drugs against the dreaded enemy the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2!
We thus see four different ways of overcoming the enemy. The very first is what people must do (use protective devices and methods, do not allow community spread, stay home and safe); the second is to attempt to use the serum from recovered patients to boost the immunity of the afflicted; the third is to look for drugs to treat the affected and the fourth is to devise successful vaccines. These take time — but hopefully in months and not in years. Let us therefore attempt all of these methods.
A few words about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19. Two days ago, the newspaper The Guardian of U.K. points out that as many as 35 companies worldwide are racing towards such a vaccine, and at least 4 of them have tested their products on animals. Some have repurposed and modified their earlier vaccines against SARS and MERS to try on COVID 19. And two companies are building vaccines based on the messenger RNA that COVID19 has. But clinical trials on humans will take time to check on their efficacies and side effects, which may be as long as a year or more. Let us therefore attempt all of these methods.
We know by experience that where there is distress, there is hope; where there is hope, there are efforts; where there are efforts, there are solutions; and where there are solutions, there is success.

How artificial intelligence can aid eye testing,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-artificial-intelligence-can-aid-eye-testing/article31192456.ece,"From diagnostics to drug development, artificial intelligence (AI) today has become a valuable extension of the medical field. A new addition to its long list of uses is a hi-tech screening tool developed by Google and an international team of researchers for detecting diabetic retinopathy a diabetic complication in the eye.
A study conducted at two eye care centres in India — Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai and Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai — which screened over 3,000 patients with diabetes, has shown that the AI’s performance exceeded the conventionally used manual grading method used to identify diabetic retinopathy . The AI had a specificity and sensitivity of around 90%. The results were published in JAMA Ophthalmology.
A specialised retinal fundus camera was used to take photos of the eye. “Usually when we need to evaluate the retina, we dilate the pupil to allow more light to enter the eye and illuminate the back of the eye. But in this fundus photography it is not necessary as a coherent beam of light can enter the small gap (Pupil) and take an image in just two to three minutes,” explains Dr. Rajiv Raman from Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai and one of the authors of the paper. 
He adds that it is very easy to operate and the cost of the camera has also significantly reduced in the recent past. Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments already have over 150 of these cameras currently in use. 
Once the images are taken, it is fed into the computer and the AI tool screens it for diabetic retinopathy. A previous paper published by the team in 2016 in JAMA explains how the AI tool was shown over 120,000 images of the retina and taught to identify what each lesion meant. According to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale, the AI tool was taught to grade the severity (none, mild, moderate, severe or proliferative) and give an instant report along with the recommendations. 
“Diabetic patients are normally asymptomatic when the eye is concerned until the late stages or advanced stage when treatment is difficult or not so effective. So it is important to find the patient at an early stage and help prevent loss of vision,” explains Dr. Kim Ramasamy from Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai. 
“What we have deployed here is an opportunistic screening. We placed the camera at the diabetologist’s clinic and trained their technician to take a picture of the back of the eye (retina) and upload it to the AI tool. In about two minutes, the patient can get their eye test report along with the other regular diabetic test reports. Based on this report, the diabetologist can further refer the patient to an ophthalmologist if needed.” he adds.
Dr. Ramasamy explains how the team has been testing this AI at even small Health Centres in Tamil Nadu. “When about 100 patients are screened, about 20 will have any level of diabetic retinopathy and only four to five might need intervention. But to track down this small number we absolutely need to screen all the diabetics, and we currently don’t have the facilities now. It would be great if we can have these opportunistic screenings at offices, railway stations or other public places,” adds Dr. Ramasamy. 
The corresponding author of the paper Lily Peng adds in an email to The Hindu: “Beyond diabetic retinopathy we are also working on a number of other research projects using AI to tackle healthcare problems. Earlier this year, we showed in a research paper that AI models can help detect breast cancer in mammography images more accurately than doctors. Our research is still in the early stages, but it shows that AI can be a path forward to improve screenings for breast cancer and boost the chances of survival.”

Infecting healthy people with coronavirus can speed up vaccine trials ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/infecting-healthy-people-with-coronavirus-can-speed-up-vaccine-trials/article31190983.ece," 
Even if everything goes to plan, it will take at least 12-18 months for a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine to be tested if conventional clinical trial procedures are adopted. Meanwhile, thousands are getting infected and hundreds are dying every few days. As a result, the healthcare system is getting stretched and strained, and doctors are forced to remove ventilators from older or sicker patients to make them available for younger people who have better chances of survival, as seen in Italy.
A preprint, which has not been peer-reviewed and published in a journal, posted in the Harvard University repository, has proposed an alternative approach to test the candidate vaccine and make it available earlier.
Yes, there is an option to accelerate the process and possibly make the vaccine rollout possible several months earlier. The process is called the “Controlled human infection model (CHIM) or simply human challenge studies. The human challenge study does not involve the conventional Phase-3 trial where thousands of healthy volunteers receive either a vaccine or a placebo and followed up for a long time to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Instead, about a hundred healthy volunteers are first vaccinated and then intentionally exposed to the novel coronavirus to test the ability of the vaccine to protect the individuals from getting infected. This will sharply cut the time taken to complete the trial.
What is the basic difference between a Phase-3 trial and a CHIM study?
In the case of the conventional Phase-3 trial, vaccine safety and efficacy are tested on high-risk volunteers who would get naturally infected. In this, all volunteers are mandatorily advised to reduce the risk of getting infected by following risk-reduction measures such as hand hygiene. Recruiting thousands of volunteers and waiting for a sizeable number of them to get infected to study the efficacy of the vaccine is what takes a long time.
But in the case of the human challenge study, previously uninfected volunteers will be first vaccinated and then deliberately exposed to the virus in a controlled environment and monitored on a regular basis. This drastically cuts down the time to study the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
Has the CHIM model been used earlier in vaccine trials?
According to 2016 World Health Organization regulatory guidelines, human challenge studies have been conducted over hundreds of years. The yellow fever experiments conducted in the early 1900s helped prove that mosquitoes transmit the virus causing yellow fever. The human challenge studies have generally been used for testing “less deadly diseases” such as influenza, dengue, typhoid, cholera and malaria.
At what stage will the human challenge study be undertaken?
According to the corresponding author Prof. Nir Eyal from the Center for Population-Level Bioethics and Department of Philosophy, Rutgers University, New Jersey, human challenge study will come into the picture only after initial safety, vaccine dosage, number of doses required and immune responses have been verified through conventional Phase-1 and Phase-2 human clinical trials. 
Who will be the ideal individuals recruited for the CHIM study?
While the coronavirus has been found to infect all age groups — children to older people — young adults in the age group 20-45 generally do not exhibit severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation and ventilator support. According to the authors, young adults who do not have any chronic conditions and who have not been already infected with the novel coronavirus will be the ideal candidates. These people should be residing in areas with high transmission rate and hence are at substantial risk of getting naturally infected with the coronavirus.
How will the vaccine be tested on the volunteers?
The safety and immune responses are tested through the conventional Phase-1 and Phase-2 trials. As part of the human challenge trial, the volunteers would be first exposed to the virus to cause an infection. “This is done to know the dosage required to produce an infection in about two-thirds of the participants,” explains Prof. Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad. She is not an author of the preprint.
“The symptoms caused by the infection will be milder than what people would get if naturally infected. To ensure that the virus causes only mild symptoms, a particular strain has to be selected or the virus should be weakened,” Prof. Kang explains. In the case of dengue, the symptom caused is just a rash and viraemia (presence of virus in the blood) and no fever, she says.
According to her, unlike in the case of Zika, the novel coronavirus does not seem to persist for a long time, thus making it ethically easier to undertake a human challenge route to test a vaccine. 
The final step will involve volunteers randomly chosen to receive either the vaccine or a placebo. After a predetermined time, during which the body develops immune response to the vaccine, the volunteers will challenged with the virus. According to the authors, the participants will be carefully followed to monitor how they respond to the viral challenge. The participants will remain isolated during the course of the study.
What will be the outcomes that will be monitored?
The authors say the primary endpoint of the trial will include measures of viral load, time taken for first symptoms to show up, and proportion of people who get infected despite being vaccinated. The immune responses in the vaccinated participants will be studied post viral challenge.
How soon will a vaccine be ready if human challenge model is adopted?
“We should have the vaccine by the end of the year if the human challenge model is adopted,” says Prof. Kang. “But licensing agencies will ask for efficacy studies to be carried out in large numbers of people post-licensing.”
However, the authors say they would conduct an expanded placebo-control study in the field on at least 3,000 people for evidence on immune responses and short-term adverse effects prior to applying for a licence.
Is carrying out a human challenge trial ethical?
“We let people, for example, volunteer to be emergency medical services during this period. That significantly elevates their risk of getting infected. But it’s also very important. In clinical trials in general, we don’t focus only on reducing risks to participants; we focus on achieving a reasonable balance between the added risks that they take and the importance for the community,” Prof. Eyal tells Nature.",science
Signs suggest summer dates for 2021 Olympics ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/signs-suggest-summer-dates-for-2021-olympics/article31200238.ece,"Tokyo Olympic organisers seem to be leaning away from starting the rescheduled games in the spring of 2021. More and more the signs point toward the summer of 2021.
Organising committee president Yoshiro Mori suggested there would be no major change from 2020.
The games are meant to be in summer, so we should be thinking of a time between June and September, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported Mori saying on Saturday.
International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, after the postponement was announced in Switzerland on Tuesday, left open the possibility of spring dates.
Mori suggested some decisions could be made as early as this week when the organising committee’s executive board meets.
Any final decision will be made between local organisers and the IOC, and hundreds of sponsors, sports federations and broadcasters.
Athletes have been left in limbo by the postponement. Many have been forced to stop training because of the spreading coronavirus virus. Even those who can train have no idea about how to schedule training to reach peak fitness at the right time.
Mori and organising committee CEO Toshiro Muto have both said the added cost of rescheduling will be enormous. Early estimates put those costs at between $2-3 billion with the several levels of Japanese governments likely to foot most of the bills.",other sports

Boxing Federation to start online coaching ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/boxing-federation-to-start-online-coaching/article31200165.ece,"The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has decided to reach out to its boxers through video conferencing, guiding and motivating them during the ongoing lockdown.
A core group, comprising all Olympics qualified boxers, coaches and support staff, including doctors and physios, has been set up to take care of the needs of the boxers. These conferences will be conducted on a daily basis.
Coaches will conduct sessions and talk to the players every day for an hour to keep them motivated and help them stay positive during this crisis.
BFI president Ajay Singh on Sunday enquired about the health, training regimen, nutrition and mental well-being of the boxers.
“This is a challenging time for all of us.

Vikas vows to win Olympic gold,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/vikas-vows-to-win-olympic-gold/article31194794.ece,"These are exciting times for Indian boxing as a record nine pugilists (five men and four women) have made the cut for the Tokyo Olympics (postponed to 2021). London 2012 had witnessed seven Indians in the fray.
Vikas Krishan, the most experienced boxer in the group, is considered a bright prospect to win a medal, even gold. He won the yellow metal in the Asian Games in 2010 (Guangzhou), and a bronze at Incheon (2014) and Jakarta (2018). He also clinched the third spot in the 2011 World championship and a gold in the 2018 Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast.
Santiago Nieva, India’s High Performance Director, said: “Vikas has been at an exceptionally high level for the last couple of years and we have high hopes on him. The 69kg category suits him better [he was in 75kg earlier] as he is more powerful and can sustain the high pace. This, along with his experience as a pro boxer in the United States, makes him a strong candidate for gold.”
The Argentine, speaking to The Hindu from Patiala on Saturday, said there were a lot of factors for Indian boxing’s gradual growth. “The most important is the work done by the Sports Authority of India through the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) in the last two years. A solid organisational structure and a strong training system at all levels are the main reasons. We have improved in many areas and the results are there for all to see,” said Nieva.
C.A. Kuttappa, head elite men’s coach, said the upward graph began after the 2016 Rio Olympics. “Both BFI and SAI sent the Indian boxers to quite a few tournaments abroad, and they were sent on merit,” he said. “Everyone received equal opportunities for training and competitions abroad.”
Kuttappa said Vikas’ strength was his powerful punches and uppercuts. “He was at his best when he defeated an experienced Kazakshtan boxer Ablaikhan Zhussupov [Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifying tournament in early March] in the semifinals where he smartly mixed his body punches and punches to the face.” 
BFI selector V. Devarajan said Vikas has the “speed and power” to take on any opponent, and “his confidence levels are high now.”
The boxer, who had been travelling frequently, is now spending quality time with wife, two sons and a daughter at his home in Bhiwani (Haryana).
“My priority is to give time to my family as they miss me when I go to camps and competitions. Training is not on my menu right now as I want to rest and recover,” Vikas told The Hindu.
About his third straight Olympics, the 28-year-old said, “I am going there to get the gold. I have trained hard. The quality of boxers doesn’t matter. I am the toughest one. I have sacrificed a lot and it is time to perform.”",other sports
Coronavirus | Iranian artistes write open letter on COVID-19 and U.S. sanctions,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/coronavirus-iranian-artistes-write-open-letter-on-covid-19-and-us-sanctions/article31196911.ece," A group of artistes from Iran have written a moving open letter to the artiste community of the world about the despairing COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, aggravated in the light of the U.S.-led Security Council sanctions. The signatories — 302 as of March 28 — include stalwarts of cinema such as Majid Majidi and Rakshan Banietemad, popular actor-filmmaker-writer Niki Karimi, actor Babak Karimi and Shahab Hosseini who won the best actor award at Cannes Film Festival in 2016 for Asghar Farhadi’s celebrated film, The Salesman.
“The people of Iran are facing a crisis today; the Corona crisis you are aware of, as well as the ‘Crisis of Unjust Imposed Sanctions’ you might not be aware of,” the artistes’ letter states. There is implicit hope that their global counterparts would be able to influence public opinion and politicians so that they’d act before it’s too late. Iran is currently fighting the worst Corona outbreak in the Middle East.
The letter starts off by saying that artistes, no matter what their nationality, are “citizens of a borderless utopia called ‘art’ which exists in a world entitled ‘culture’ ”. They strive to improve their nations with their collective works and have talent to influence people and make them understand issues. “Regardless of our religious backgrounds and ideologies, using our individual tastes, styles and cultural characteristics, we all create narratives and images with our works of art; for peace over war, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, and of course for our salvation and resurrection,” the letter states.
It goes on to say that though global politics and its superpowers have created gaps to keep the artistes separated, they have become stronger and more determined in transferring their collective messages of humanity and peace to the world.
It talks of everyone, regardless of their geographic or political situation, coming face to face with a common enemy — COVID-19. “We are all equally vulnerable to this microscopic adversary. The salvation of one, depends on the salvation of all. Corona is not just a virus, it is a simple and historic question that is waiting for complex answers from the people and governments of the world.” It then goes on to focus on the debilitating effect of the sanctions on Iran in the country’s fight against the pandemic saying that “its breaths are limited by inhumane global sanctions”.

“This crisis shall pass too, with small or catastrophic losses, but the collection of tales will remain as well. The stories of exhausted nurses dancing in contaminated hospital hallways to raise the morale of patients, as they hide their worries about the lack of medicines and basic hospital facilities; stories of physicians who haven’t been home in weeks and are forced to work without masks, gloves, gowns as they search for Corona victims in the hallways of the hospitals. These will all remain in the micro-historical memories of our time, and will be heard by all, sooner or later, either from us or from you all,” it states.
Hoping that it will not be too late for influential and unified artistes of the world to tell the stories of the injustices towards the Iranian people, so that the powerful politicians of the world may make the right choices, it informs them that a large number of infected victims (including the elderly who are the most vulnerable) are facing shortages of medical supplies. It ends with questions posited to the artistes of the world — “What do you think? What do you say? And what will you do?”",entertainment
Some ideas to make your debt MF investment tax efficient ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/some-ideas-to-make-your-debt-mf-investment-tax-efficient/article31194841.ece,"In the article of March 9, 2020 (https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/some-ideas-to-make-your-mf-investments-tax-efficient/article31011110.ece), we discussed about tax efficiency in equity mutual funds. Now, we will discuss about debt mutual funds (MFs), also known as fixed income MFs.
There are two options in a fund viz. a dividend option where the MF pays dividend to you and the growth option, where there is no payout but the gains remain in the NAV and you can redeem the investment at that NAV when you want. Tax efficiency is better in the growth option, which we will discuss here. 
In the dividend option, as mentioned in the Union Budget, dividends are taxable in your hands from April 1, 2020 instead of the earlier system of the MF deducting a dividend distribution tax (DDT) on your behalf and paying the government.
 If you are in a lower tax slab, say 5% or 20%, the dividend option is tax efficient but most investors are in the 30% tax bracket.
In the growth option, to get the benefit of a lower tax rate, you have to hold the MF for three years. This is technically called long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax. Upon holding your debt MF units for three years, you become eligible for this levy.
If you hold it for less than three years, it is short-term capital gains (STCG) taxed at your slab rate. Here again, you are better off if you are at a lower tax slab, but assuming you are in the 30% bracket, it is not very tax efficient. In the LTCG, there is a defined tax rate of 20% on the gains. But there is the benefit of ‘indexation’ by virtue of which the effective tax rate comes down significantly. 
The way indexation works is like this — the tax authorities declare an index number, called cost inflation index (CII), every year. As per this, your purchase cost is ‘indexed up,’ hence, the taxable component of the gains comes down significantly.
Now, let’s see how indexation works. Let us say you invested in a debt mutual fund growth option on August 27, 2016 (or any date in financial year 2016-17) at ₹100 and redeemed it on August 27, 2019 (or any date thereafter to complete three years of holding) at ₹121. The CII for financial year 2016-17 as declared by the government is 264 and the CII for financial year 2019-20 is 289. Hence, your purchase cost gets indexed up, for tax purposes, to ₹100 x 289/264 = ₹109.47. Your taxable LTCG is ₹121 – ₹109.47 = ₹11.53. Tax at 20% (ignoring surcharge and cess for simplicity) will be ₹11.53 x 20% = ₹2.31. Thus, the effective tax rate, as a percentage of your gains, is ₹2.31 / ₹21 = 11%. 
Now, let’s extend this method. You invested in a debt mutual fund on March 27, 2016 at ₹100 and redeemed it at ₹121 on April 12, 2019. Here, you get the indexation for one more financial year. The CII for 2015-16 was 254, that for 2019-20 was 289 and your indexed purchase cost is ₹100 x 289/254 = ₹113.77. Your taxable component is ₹121 – ₹113.77 = ₹7.23. The tax at 20% (ignoring surcharge and cess) is ₹7.23 X 20% = 1.45. The effective tax rate, as a percentage of your long term capital gains, is ₹1.45 /₹21 = 6.9%.
The data on CII is available through Google. To ensure you are referring at correct numbers, you may cross-check with the numbers mentioned above e.g. 289 for 2019-20. The CII for a financial year is announced sometime around August to October of the year, with reference to CPI inflation of the previous year. 
To summarise, you reduce your tax in debt MFs by viz. holding the fund in growth option and for at least three years. If you invest in March and redeem in April after approximately three years, it’s even better.
You may use debt MFs after retirement, called the distribution phase of life, through a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP). That is, you would place your retirement kitty in debt MFs and do SWPs to withdraw as per your requirements every month. 
To generate tax efficiency in SWP, you have to start the SWP three years after retirement. For tax purposes, to match against the exit, the NAV of your earliest investment will be considered. This is known as First In First Out (FIFO) i.e. every exit will be matched with the earliest entry in that fund. 
Another point to be noted, in the context of availing indexation benefit in debt MFs, is that there is a notion among some people that the benefit of indexation is available by investing in Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) in March, which will mature after approximately three years in April. While this is correct and gives you the benefit of indexation across four financial years, this is true for all debt funds viz. short duration fund, long duration fund, etc. 
You will invest as per your preference, but for comparison purposes, FMPs are not liquid. There is no redemption with the AMC in FMPs and though listed at the exchange, there is no liquidity. If you invest in open-ended funds i.e. the usual short duration fund or banking and PSU fund, in case you require your money, you can redeem with the AMC.

A measure of volatility via prism of markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/a-measure-of-volatility-via-prism-of-markets/article31194722.ece,"What is India VIX?
India VIX is an index that serves as a measure of market expectation of volatility in the near term. Simply put, while volatility signifies the rate and magnitude of change in the stock price or index value, the movement in the VIX index reflects the overall market volatility expectations over the next 30 days. So, a spike in the VIX value means the market is expecting higher volatility in the near future.
Why do we have a VIX index?
India VIX index is not the first of its kind in the world. 
The VIX index was first created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and introduced in 1993 based on the prices of S&P 500 index. 
Since then, it has become a globally-recognised gauge of volatility in the U.S equity markets. The India VIX was launched with a similar intent in 2010 and is based on the computation methodology of CBOE though amended to align with the Indian markets. 
While derivatives contracts were also launched on India VIX, those never really registered any significant volume. 
Incidentally, the VIX value is among the important parameters that are taken into account for pricing of options contracts, which are one of the most popular derivative instruments.
How is VIX index behaving currently?
In the current calendar year, the India VIX index has jumped fivefold, from around 12 levels to the current 67 levels, which clearly hints that the market perceives that volatility will only increase in the coming days. 
Incidentally, the index is currently trading at record highs and on some days in the recent past, saw a surge of more than 20% in a single day. 
The trend has been similar in CBOE VIX as well, having surged from below 15 levels in February to the current 67. It touched a high of 82 on March 16. Interestingly, given the nature of the index, it is also known as ‘fear gauge’ or ‘fear index’.",business
Policies for pandemics,https://www.thehindu.com/business/policies-for-pandemics/article31194705.ece,"The world is cowering under the COVID19 threat. Let’s take a look at the insurance cover is available for those who get infected.
The first question that comes to mind is: will my hospitalisation policy pay for a COVID-19-related hospitalisation and treatment? 
The answer seems clear, up to a point. Existing policies should cover hospitalisation unless specifically excluded or if epidemics and pandemics are excluded. Read your policy document for clarity. If neither is the case, we can conclude that coverage is available. 
(In the case of other covers like property and liability, insurance companies do suspend cover under a force majeure clause which means natural and man-made disasters, including pandemics). 
 The reason is a high number of claims can devastate the insurance industry. Should this happen, the role of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to direct and persuade the industry would be much looked forward to. As for health policies, IRDAI has issued a circular that new products cannot exclude pandemics.
Given that cover is available, the next question is, what will be covered. Hospitalisation expenses as well as 30 days pre-hospitalisation and 60 days post-hospitalisation expenses are standard covers on these policies. 
COVID-19 test costs should be covered as should quarantine period medical expenses that are admissible. All claims will follow the policy scope and terms.
As it stands, new policies will exclude hospitalisation claims in the first 30 days except in cases where there was unbroken coverage in the preceding four years with no related claims in that period. 
As for life insurance policies, death due to COVID-19 would be payable within the overall terms and conditions of the policy. 
Coming back to health policies, there are new COVID-19-specific policies launched by some insurance companies, notably Star Health Insurance Company Ltd. and GoDigit. These are timely, if a bit restricted in coverage. 
Star Health’s policy is a one-year benefit policy with sum insured options of ₹21,000 and ₹42,000. It pays out a lumpsum on hospitalisation and diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection. It does not provide coverage for hospitalisation expenses as such, but then the hospitalisation costs are being borne by the government. 
The annual policy has a waiting period of 16 days from the commencement of cover, that takes care of the incubation period of the virus. Should the insured travel outside India during the policy period, no claim payment will be made.
GoDigit offers a benefit policy for ₹25,000 SI (sum insured) with conditions that the insured or his close family should not have travelled to specified countries after December 1, 2019. Those insured, who had displayed symptoms of COVID-19 in the six weeks preceding the policy, will also not be eligible for a claim.
DBS Bank India has tied-up with Bharti AXA General Insurance Company Limited to roll out a complimentary insurance plan for its customers covering all medical conditions, including COVID-19. The 30-day cover will pay ₹5,000 a day for up to 10 days of hospitalisation. 
ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited’s COVID-19 Protection Cover is also a benefit policy that pays the sum insured when the insured is declared COVID-19 positive.
Edelweiss General Insurance Company Limited has a COVID-19 policy that will be extended to those quarantined in specified government facilities.

Ask US ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ask-us/article31194672.ece,"Q. I am 43. I am shifting from a corporate job to the education field. I want to invest about ₹28 lakh of my PF money in a security that will provide me with a regular income (on a quarterly basis).
Can you advise me on the right option to invest in? I need the least risky one.
Lakshmi
A. Since you have stated that you need the least risky option, you can look at a combination of bank deposits and post office schemes. Split the deposit with 2-3 banks and make sure you are with at least one systemically important bank (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank). You can consider Post Office National Savings Time Deposit. This will ensure that you do not compromise on safety. However, it needs to be said that it is not very tax efficient. If you are in the 20% tax bracket or less, then this is just about ok. Else, this will generate post-tax returns of less than 5%. But that is the price one pays for safety.
If you are in the highest tax bracket and are game for some risk, then you can invest a small amount in liquid mutual funds and do a systematic withdrawal plan. This will be more tax efficient but comes with uncertainty of returns (no guarantee) and marginally higher risk than deposits.
Q. I am 32 years old and would like to invest over a period of 25 years to save for my retirement. My goal is to achieve a minimum corpus of ₹8 crore after 25 years. I can invest in SIP at ₹30,000 a month. Please let me know about safe investments. My adviser told me to invest in three different funds, but I prefer your advice. I fear all my investments can go bust if markets collapse after 20 or 25 years. So, please let me know how to proceed.
Patrick Olivera
A.Safety and high returns do not go together. If you are unwilling to take some risks, then only deposits will fit your requirement. But, they won’t get you to where you want unless you have a very high saving rate. For example, let us assume over this period, your average return on deposits is 6%. For you to get to ₹8 crore in 25 years, you will need to step up your monthly savings by ₹10,000 every year. That is ₹30,000 a month in the first year, ₹40,000 in the second year and so on. That will be an average of 10% increase over these 25 years but with significant hikes in early years (since a ₹10,000 per month increase amounts to a 33% jump in savings and then a 25% and so on, given the low base). This is not easy if you have EMI commitments. Use PF, post office schemes and bank deposits, without fear of market collapse. But this is not without nil risk. We had 10-12% interest in the 90s but have steadily declined since. In another 20-25 years, as we become a developed economy, rates can further fall.
The other route is to have an asset- allocated approach to investing, with equity and debt. For example, start with a 50% allocation for post office time deposits, PF, NSC and bank recurring deposits. For the equity part, consider a simple equity index fund and a multi-cap fund. This will ensure, as a portfolio, you are not too hurt by hits such as the present one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic since your debt component will protect you. But here again, you need to step up your monthly investments by at least ₹5,000 every year to make sure you reach your target. As you get comfortable with mutual funds, make it 60% in equity funds and add a mid-cap fund later. The present market fall provides opportunities to enter. But, think long term. Markets can fall from here in the next few months. Test waters now to see if you can handle the volatility. If you do, you know you will survive equity investing. Else, go back to the first option.

"Tamil folk singer, actress Paravai Muniyamma no more",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tamil-folk-singer-actress-paravai-muniyamma-no-more/article31197302.ece," Folk singer and actress Paravai Muniyamma died in Madurai on Sunday. The octogenarian had been suffering from age-related ailments for a few years now. 
She shot to fame in 2003 with her role in the film Dhool, in which she starred alongside actors Vikram and Jyothika. Her song Madurai veeran became a huge hit and she went on to star in several Tamil films. Among her other memorable onscreen appearances was with actor and comedian Vivekh in the film Kadhal Sadugudu. She also starred in Kovil, Devathaiyai Kanden, Thoranai and Thamizh Padam among others. 
As a folk artiste, she also gave several performances abroad. In an interview with The Hindu in 2004 she had said - “My overseas programmes stand testimony to the fact that human race has an unquenchable passion for folk art and culture. Folk songs cannot be withered away by disco, jazz or rock”.
She also had a successful stint on television with her rustic cooking show in which she showcased several traditional recipes. 
Following reports about Paravai Muniyamma’s ill health and financial woes, former Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa had announced a financial assistance of ₹6 lakh and a monthly aid of ₹6,000 to her in 2015. 
In March 2019, she was honoured with the Kalaimamani title by the Tamil Nadu government. ",movies

Coronavirus | Why has Kerala sought a relaxation of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management rules? ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/coronavirus-why-has-kerala-sought-a-relaxation-of-fiscal-responsibility-and-budget-management-rules/article31194488.ece,"The story so far: Kerala was one of the earliest States to announce an economic package of ₹20,000 crore to mitigate the impact on livelihoods and overall economic activity from the sweeping steps taken to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, including the latest 21-day nationwide lockdown. Explaining the rationale for the package, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote in the The Hindu (March 27, 2020): “While we enforce the lockdown in all its seriousness, we should not lose sight of the other major challenge in front of us. India has a high share of poor in its population, most of whom suffer from multiple economic and social deprivations. They earn their livelihoods from the informal and unorganised sectors, where there is neither job security nor continuity of income flows. Their livelihoods have to be protected through the lockdown period.” To help fund the emergency relief package, the State proposes to borrow as much as ₹12,500 crore from the market in April itself and the Chief Minister has urged the Centre to provide Kerala with flexibility under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act so as to ensure that the State’s finances are not adversely impacted in the rest of the financial year starting on April 1.
Enacted in August 2003, the legislation is aimed at making the Central government responsible for ensuring “inter-generational equity in fiscal management and long-term macro-economic stability”. In other words, the current generation of the country’s administrators must ensure that their management of the country’s finances, both in terms of expenditure and revenue, does not leave future generations saddled with the burden of having to service unsustainably high levels of inherited debt that would in turn affect their ability to provide a stable economic environment for contemporary society. To achieve this, the Act envisages the setting of limits on the Central government’s debt and deficits as well as mandating greater transparency in fiscal operations of the Central government and the conduct of fiscal policy in a medium-term framework. The rules for implementing the Act were notified in July 2004 and since then every Budget of the Union government has included a Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement that specifies the annual revenue and fiscal deficit goals over a three-year horizon. The government also uses the Budget to spell out the longer-term glide path to achieve the key objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP within a specified time frame — one that has shifted from the initial goal of March 31, 2009, to March 31, 2021, when the rules were amended in 2018, and most recently to the setting of a target of 3.1% for March 2023.
To ensure that the States too are financially prudent, the 12th Finance Commission’s recommendations in 2004 linked debt relief to States with their enactment of similar laws. The States have since enacted their own respective Financial Responsibility Legislation, which sets the same 3% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) cap on their annual budget deficits.
Kerala’s current fiscal position means that it can borrow about ₹25,000 crore during the financial year 2020-21. Now, given that it proposes to raise half that amount of debt in the very first month of the new financial year, the State government is understandably concerned that the stringent borrowing cap under the fiscal responsibility laws should not constrain its borrowing and spending ability over the remaining 11 months — a period when it would not only need to continue with its COVID-19 mitigation measures but would also have to meet other expenditure for routine affairs related to the running of the State’s socio-economic programmes as well as the post pandemic recovery.
The law does contain what is commonly referred to as an ‘escape clause’. Under Section 4(2) of the Act, the Centre can exceed the annual fiscal deficit target citing grounds that include national security, war, national calamity, collapse of agriculture, structural reforms and decline in real output growth of a quarter by at least three percentage points below the average of the previous four quarters.
Given that the ongoing pandemic could be considered as a national calamity — which in conjunction with the ongoing lockdown to combat it is in all likelihood going to cause a severe contraction in economic output as well — the current circumstances would be apt for suspending both the Centre’s and States’ fiscal deficit targets. This would allow both the Union government and States including Kerala to undertake the much-needed increases in expenditure to meet the extraordinary circumstances.
There have been several instances of the FRBM goals being reset. Most recently, presenting the Budget for 2020-21 in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had cited the recent reductions in corporate tax as structural reforms that would trigger the escape clause enabling the government to recalibrate the fiscal deficit target for 2019-20 to 3.8%, from the budgeted 3.3%. The spillover impact of the reforms would also necessitate a reset for 2020-21: from the earlier deficit target of 3% to 3.5%. 
But the most significant FRBM deviation happened in 2008-09, in the wake of the global financial crisis, when the Centre resorted to a focused fiscal stimulus: tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets, to counter the fallout of the global slowdown. This led to the fiscal deficit climbing to 6.2%, from a budgeted goal of 2.7%.
Simultaneously, the deficit goals for the States too were relaxed to 3.5% of GSDP for 2008-09 and 4% of GSDP for fiscal 2009-10. 
The precedents are there and given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and its devastating impact on the global economy, another significant deviation from the FRBM norms is very likely in the current and next fiscal years.",economy
Coronavirus | Why has the stock market been so volatile?,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/coronavirus-why-has-the-stock-market-been-so-volatile/article31194421.ece,"The story so far: On Friday, even after the Reserve Bank of India announced a slew of measures to boost the economy in the time of a pandemic, shares fell 1% to close at 29,416 points. The stock market has seen a lot of volatility with the benchmark Sensex having fallen as much as almost 40% from the highs it touched in January.
On January 20, the Sensex touched an all time intra-day record high of 42,274 from where it fell a massive 16,635 points to touch a 52-week intra-day low of 25,639 points on March 24. This assumes significance as a fall of over 20% is typically looked upon as a bear phase in the markets. While the 30-share barometer has recovered 4,177 points or 16% from the lows, it is still experiencing a lot of volatility with underlying weakness. Incidentally, the India VIX index, which is considered a measure of near-term volatility in the market, has surged more than six times this year, rising from 11.7 in December to the current levels of 70.4. The intensity of the fall can be further gauged from the fact that the current month has seen the indices hitting their lower circuit breaker of 10% on two occasions while registering some of the biggest single-day falls as well.
The single biggest reason of the ongoing volatility and fall is the global coronavirus pandemic. In India, the number of coronavirus cases stand at a shade below 1,000 (as on March 28) even as the country is in the midst of a 21-day lockdown as part of the government’s attempts to curb the spread. The pandemic has led to concerns that global economic growth will get deeply affected. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already said that the world has entered a recession that is as bad or worse as 2008 when the global financial crisis happened. In India, investor concerns have led to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) selling equities worth nearly ₹60,000 crore in the current month, the highest ever single month sales by overseas investors. 
An across-the-board selling frenzy has gripped the markets with no sector insulated from the sell-off. Banking and financials, however, have borne the brunt as investors believe that the economic impact of the pandemic will lead to a rise in bad debts of such entities. Sector heavyweights such as HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance, all part of the Sensex, have fallen significantly with some currently trading near multi-year lows. Automobile stocks have also been among the worst hit as most plants are shut on account of the lockdown. Some of the pharmaceutical and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) stocks have been able to stem the fall to a limited extent though they are currently significantly lower compared to their highs.
Globally, governments and regulators are taking initiatives in the form of stimulus measures to support the economy. For instance, the U.S. Senate and House have approved a $2-trillion coronavirus relief package. Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a $700-billion stimulus package. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the key interest rate sharply by 75 basis points and allowed equated monthly instalments (EMIs) to be deferred by three months. The repo rate has been reduced by 75 bps while the reverse repo rate has been cut by 90 bps. Further, the cash reserve ratio has also been reduced that will release ₹1.37-lakh crore liquidity. Cumulatively, the RBI measures will lead to an infusion of ₹3.74-lakh crore into the banking system. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), on its part, has relaxed many compliance requirements while tightening the norms for short selling and margins to ensure the smooth functioning of the equity markets.
The consensus estimate is pessimistic due to the lack of any positive triggers. While policy makers worldwide are trying to provide stimulus, the uncertainty around the pandemic has made investors risk averse. They feel that since the current crisis is not due to a liquidity crunch, as was the case during the Lehman crisis, it is difficult to counter it with mere liquidity infusion. Most analysts expect the pandemic to affect corporate earnings over the next few quarters. Global financial major Morgan Stanley has lowered its year-end Sensex target by a little over 11% to 32,000, from the earlier 36,000, even as it believes that the current bear phase in the stock market is close to its bottom. Analysts are unanimous in their view that the pandemic will hit India’s growth rate and hence risky assets like equities are seeing a sell-off from investors across categories.",markets
International Table Tennis Federation rankings as of March 2020 stays,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/international-table-tennis-federation-rankings-as-of-march-2020-stays/article31211742.ece,"The International Table Tennis Federation’s (ITTF) decision on Sunday to freeze the rankings as of March 2020 (only points awarded for events held until February will be taken into consideration) due to COVID-19 has many paddlers questioning the fate of tournaments that took place this month.
The ITTF decided, among other things, on the “suspension of all currently planned events and activities that involve international travel until June 30 and freezing of ITTF rankings lists as of March 2020 and further evaluations of all implications related to the postponement of events, travel restrictions and other complications with scope for further decisions on potentially necessary adjustments.”
Sharath Kamal, who won his first title in a decade at the Oman Open ITTF Challenge Plus (March 11 to 15), is keeping his fingers crossed. The 37-year-old said he is hopeful that his 1100 points will be added when the rankings list is released.
Speaking to The Hindu here on Monday, Sharath said: “Will the ITTF add my Oman Open ranking points? [Indian paddler] G. Sathiyan believes they will. If the ITTF includes my points in the rankings [which were supposed to be released in April], I will be in the top 30.” He is now ranked 38.
With the Hong Kong Open and China Open in May being cancelled/postponed and the Korea Open and Australia Open not happening in June, Sharath said there was no clarity on when the rankings will be released. 
“I hope I don’t lose the points I got by winning the Oman Open,” he said. 
Harmeet Desai, the reigning Commonwealth champion who reached the semifinals at Oman, is hoping against hope that he will get his 715 ranking points. “I hope we don’t lose our points,” he said. 
In response to Harmeet’s query about the points, ITTF World ranking manager Javier Angulo Luceron said: “the executive committee’s decision was to freeze the ranking as it is due to complications we had in March events [some nations couldn’t participate due to the pandemic, and the Polish Open Challenge Plus was suspended midway on March 13]. Nonetheless, the points achieved will be added and count[ed] once a decision is made about what to do with the problematic events,” he said.",other sports

The youngster reached the summit, but the rest of 2019 wasn’t great for him. He had to wait until February 2020 to get his first tournament win — the Hillerod Chess Club open in Denmark — and followed it up with another win at the Cannes Open.
Just when he was hitting good form, the coronavirus pandemic scuppered his plans.

Speaking to The Hindu, Gukesh said, “After last year, I did not play well for a year, and my rating even went down. I needed to work on a few areas like openings and dealing with time pressure.”
“Winning these two tournaments has really helped my confidence. I felt I played well after a long time.”
One reason for the change in fortunes was the camp in January for young chess players in Chennai, organised by Microsense with chess legends Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand.

Speaking about the experience, Gukesh said, “It was a different camp. For 10 days, through the day, I focused on openings. 
“It came at the right time as well since I was trying a different approach. So, it was very useful.”
Another area that Gukesh said he improved was in dealing with time pressure. 
He worked extensively on the time taken for his opening with his coach Vishnu Prasanna. 
The wins in the last two events helped him pocket 20 points and take his Elo rating to 2563, and the 13-year-old targeted going past 2600 this year.
COVID-19, however, has forced the cancellation of tournaments in Germany and Iceland with no events likely to be held till the end of April.
Gukesh, who plays a lot of matches in a year, is not happy about this forced break.

Radjabov wants his place back in Candidates ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/radjabov-wants-his-place-back-in-candidates/article31200225.ece,"The coronavirus seems to have caught up with the Candidates chess tournament, too.
Until it was stopped mid-way at Yekaterinburg on Thursday, it was the world's only major sporting event that went ahead as planned. But, the Russian government's ban of international flights forced the world chess governing body, FIDE, to adjourn the tournament.
That decision, however, has thrown up a new problem for FIDE. And it could go all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (when normalcy returns, of course).
Teimour Radjabov, who had pulled out after FIDE turned down his request to postpone the tournament in view of the virus outbreak, is considering legal options. The World No. 9 feels he should be allowed to compete in the Candidates now that FIDE has adjourned the event because of the pandemic.
There are top players who feel Radjabov has been denied justice. Among them are Russia's Sergey Karjakin and India's P. Harkrishna, ranked 17th and 27th respectively in the world.
“I hope at least now FIDE will accept responsibility and apologise,” Harikrishna tweeted. 
Radjabov wants more than an apology, of course. “Once you are considering starting the event in these circumstances you, first of all, have to make some kind of analysis in the General Assembly of FIDE. There are people who have to talk to each other and decide on the situation,” the World No. 9 from Azerbaijan told chess.com. 
He added: “I think FIDE should take some action to include me back in the tournament. I think I have did everything possible - asked them, warned them. I also warned the chess community.” 
But, allowing Radjabov back into the tournament may not be easy. After he withdrew, FIDE invited Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France.
“If Radjabov were to be included in the field, he would have to play all eight participants and only after that the second half of this round-robin tournament could be conducted,” Mumbai-based Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay told The Hindu.
 “I don't think FIDE could be blamed entirely for the situation. 
“Things weren't this bad when the tournament started. Nevertheless, I feel FIDE should compensate Radjabov financially.”
The Azerbaijan national team, comprising five GMs, has also come out in support of Radjabov, through an open letter to FIDE, demanding his re-instation in the World championship qualifying cycle.",other sports

Resident Evil 3 RemakeDeveloper: CapcomPublisher: CapcomPrice: ₹3499 for Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC
However, the pandemic in question in Resident Evil 3 turns those infected into zombies or worse. Hot on the heels of the success of the remake of Resident Evil 2, Capcom revives another classic in all its gory glory.
Resident Evil 3 Remake puts you in the shoes of a hunted Jill Valentine, a S.T.A.R.S officer in the virus-ravaged Raccoon City, who is targeted by a bio-organic weapon known as Nemesis. If you thought the Tyrant (a humanoid monster from the previous game, also known as Mr X) was a waking nightmare, this hulking creature of violent mutation will make him look like a kitten.

Where the Resident Evil formula works best is when creatures like Nemesis are placed into the equation. Just look at Mr X and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard’s Baker family — the survival horror just amplifies the gameplay of RE3 Remake with several injections of urgency and the constant feeling that something is following you, thanks to tell-tale growls, thudding footsteps, and whooshes of wind. RE3 Remake constantly has you on the edge of your seat in the best ways.
Well-portrayed here, Jill Valentine makes for a strong female protagonist, while also resembling Milla Jovovich (who portrays Alice in the Resident Evil movies). As we would expect, Jill stands strong and often revs up to take on monsters.

RE3 Remake stumbles, well, in the stumbles. There is not much in the way of mobility apart from a dodge, but both playable characters, Jill and mercenary Carlos Oliveira, move at frustratingly sluggish paces. I found myself yelling at the screen most of the time, run faster. For a game with this level of urgency, more dynamism in the mobility would have been appreciated. Couple this movement with enemies that sometimes appear off camera and attack with far reach, and there are times I felt that the experience meant fighting the camera and controls more.
Resident Evil: ResistanceAlong with Resident Evil 3, you also get a multi-player game bundle called Resident Evil: Resistance, which pits one mastermind against four other players, all for whom the former has laid out traps. As one of those four players, you have to fight through those odds to defeat the mastermind as the final boss. 
In true survival-horror fashion, you are constantly starved of health items and ammunition, leaving you to scrounge everywhere. Resident Evil 3 is light on the puzzle-solving, which the previous game had in abundance. The few puzzles are mostly environmental, leaving you more focused on exploration to find certain items or keys that open certain doors. Since the timeline sort of runs in parallel to the previous game; if you have played that, then it occasionally gives you slight context.
Resident Evil 3, in its original avatar in 1999, marked the franchise going more cinematic and it translates well with the new graphics engine. No graphics engine renders flesh and gore better than Capcom’s RE (Reach for the Moon) Engine. Zombies get chunks blown off them realistically, revealing layers of flesh, muscle then bone, which looks incredible from a technical standpoint — but also real enough to lose your lunch over.

The facial-scanning process Capcom has is magic, and Jill, Carlos and the rest of the cast look impressively realistic. A lot of care and detail has gone into the animations, especially of the protagonists and the zombie variants, transforming that tired old monster trope of ‘the walking dead’ into something to be feared again. The rollercoaster game will take you about eight hours to complete, and it is not worth missing. ",entertainment

"National lockdown | Salman Khan to help 25,000 workers in film industry ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/salmanv-khan-to-help-25000-workers-in-film-industry/article31201587.ece,"Actor Salman Khan has pledged to financially support 25,000 daily wage workers from the film industry in the wake of the national lockdown, according to Federation of Western Indian Cine Employees (FWICE).
 The daily wage workers across different avenues are badly hit by the 21-day lockdown.
According to FWICE president B N Tiwari, Salman via his Being Human Foundation reached out to their organisation. “Salman’s Being Human Foundation has come forward to help daily wage workers. They called us three days ago. We have about 5 lakh workers, out of which 25,000 are in dire need of financial help. Being Human Foundation said they will take care of these workers on their own. They have asked for account details of these 25,000 workers,” Mr. Tiwari said.
“The remaining 4,75,000 workers can survive for about a month. We already have huge ration packets for all the workers but unfortunately due to lockdown they are not able to come here to collect it. We are thinking of ways how to reach out to them,” he added.
Mr. Tiwari said FWICE has reached out to several actors and filmmakers to make a contribution.
“We have written letters and also sent messages to various people in the film industry to come forward and help the workers but we haven’t received any response from them. Producer Mahaveer Jain has offered to provide help in terms of food and essential items,” he added.
 Earlier in the week, filmmakers and actors, including Karan Johar, Taapsee Pannu, Ayushmann Khurrana, Kiara Advani, Rakul Preet Singh, Sidharth Malhotra, and Nitesh Tiwari pledged their support to a new initiative aimed at supporting the daily wage earners.
 The initiative, I Stand With Humanity, started by organisations -- the International Association for Human Values, the Art of Living Foundation and the Indian Film and TV Industry, will provide families of daily wage workers with 10 days of essential food supplies.
 On March 18, the Producers Guild of India announced that they have set up a relief fund for daily wage earners impacted by the shutdown of film, television and web productions amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 Their decision came after many filmmakers, including Sudhir Mishra, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap, raised concerns over the impact of shutdown on the daily wage workers.
 According to the Health Ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases rose to 979 on Sunday, with death toll climbing to 25.",entertainment
Here’s why a couple named their first child after a student from Jamia ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/a-student-from-jamia-millia-islamia-has-a-child-named-after-her-in-post-riot-hit-delhi/article31212265.ece," A few weeks ago, Nayla Khwaja, 24, a post-graduate student who is studying development communication at Jamia Millia Islamia University, came across a WhatsApp message about Noor Bi, 19, a riot-affected pregnant woman. Bi was in urgent need of a woman volunteer for assistance at Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, Shahadara.
After their house was torched in the communal riots that took place in February in North East Delhi, Bi and her husband Ghulam Waris, 23, residents of Seelampur, were in dire need of help.
Khwaja, along with Mohammad Humam, 21, a fellow student, went to the hospital and Khwaja stayed with Bi through seven hours of the nine to 10 hours of labour. “She held my hand tightly the whole time as she delivered her first baby,” said Khwaja, who was also seeing the process of delivery for the first time.
After the delivery, Noor Bi says that in the evening Khwaja brought her tea, hot water, and a towel for her baby. “Nayla Ma’am gave us courage when we have lost everything,” says Waris, a carpenter, who is yet to return home, and is staying with his wife and daughter at a friend’s house.
“The name of our daughter is proof of how grateful we are for everything Nayla did for us,” says Noor Bi.
Delighted by the experience, Khwaja and Humam distributed sweets in the hospital. The next day, when she called Waris to ask after the mother and child, he told her that Chhoti Nayla was doing well.
“It’s like the most respectful thing anyone has ever done for me,” says Khwaja, who has, in the past, seen tough times, with a friend receiving a bullet in his hand during the riots.

What happens in an old-age home during India’s Coronavirus lockdown? ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/home-for-the-elderly-ngo-davo-faces-troubles-in-the-coronavirus-lockdown-with-no-volunteers-and-limited-food-supply/article31207498.ece," For the senior citizens who live on the premises of the not-for-profit home for seniors, Davo, in Dwarka, Delhi, social distancing is not new. They have been abandoned by their families and do not have the means to afford their own spaces. Of the 60 inmates, who live in a 1,800 square foot area, 20 are mentally challenged, and eight are differently-abled. There are four women too.
Dev Goswami, a former truck driver who started operating the NGO in 2016, is trying to keep them occupied and fed. The restriction on movement though, has kept away the 20-30 volunteers who used to come in daily 
When Goswami was on the road, working as a truck driver from 1978 to 2007, his heart would often go out to the elderly. “While driving, I would come across old people on highways like National Highway 24, the Grand Trunk Road. I would feel bad, so I would make extra rotis, share my meals with them, give them a shave, and occasionally bathe them.”
Today, at a time when physical distancing has become a part of our reality, life is difficult. Earlier, the inmates were given a bath in batches of four or five. Now, they have to be bathed individually. The bathing area lies outside the gate, so each one has to be escorted there one at a time. “We cannot let them be outside even for a minute,"" says Goswami, referring to the lockdown in India, due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Luckily, Harish Sharma, formerly a Blue Line bus driver, chips in by giving them bath. Life has been tough for him -- his son deserted him when he got sick, but he is not giving up. “I believe in overcoming hindrances, and we'll get through COVID- 19 too,” says Sharma, who came to Davo in 2017, directly from Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, where he was getting treated for chikungunya.

Sharma believes in seva, but says there just isn't enough to around. “In the morning, we serve tea and rusk. For lunch we serve chawal, dal, and rotis. Dinner is light and kichree is made. But our donors have stopped giving us food. Earlier, we would tell them what we needed. Now, they are afraid to come to the ashram,"" he says, adding that they fear the police and the transmission of the coronavirus. Goswami adds that earlier, tea was made twice a day for the inmates. Now it is made only once, and each batch gets less milky.
He talks of how the elderly could sit in the morning sun before the lockdown, but that has come to a stop. They still try to keep spirits up though. “We play bhajan, kirtan and they start singing.”
To ensure that the inmates are healthy, they are given a vitamin C supplement -- Goswami understands that the elderly are the most vulnerable. Protein supplements were to arrive, but the lack of movement due to the lockdown across the country have prevented it. “Let us hope it arrives soon,” says Kamal, his son, who works in the health department in the Delhi government, and helps his father out. He adds that the situation is made more difficult by shops increasing prices of basics: ""Sugar has risen from ₹1,600 for a packet of 50 kg to ₹1,800. Similarly, the price of atta has galloped from ₹20 to 30 per kilo.""
Tara, Goswami's wife is also involved, helping the women inmates and supervising cooking and other activities. 
How long will he be able to keep this up? “I am a person with a positive frame of mind. I have never given up on anything,” he says.",society

The 26-year-old’s number has become a sort of helpline to the many travellers — primarily foreigners — stuck in India due to the COVID-19 lockdown. There are calls coming in from Gaya, Dharamshala, Visakhapatnam, Goa...

It all started just before the first day-long curfew was announced on March 22. Shubham, a resident of Mumbai, was in Jaisalmer, shooting a documentary on the lives of different tribes. “I met a few friends from France and we realised things were crazy. Everything was shut around the fort area. Hotels, hostels, and houses were asking foreign guests to leave immediately,” recalls Shubham. They feared the guests might be carriers of COVID-19. He met a 25-year-old from South Africa who had gone on a three-day desert safari, only to return to Jaisalmer and find her belongings lying outside the hotel. “She told me foreigners were being harassed,” he says. A few people were even stopping to scream “Corona” at their faces before driving away.

So, Shubham gathered all the foreign nationals he met and took them to the hospital to get them tested. Once they tested negative and were cleared, he decided it was best for them to be in Delhi so that they could find a way to get back to their respective countries. “I found the last train leaving at 4.30 pm on Saturday. There were 12 of us. We boarded the train and found more people from Spain, Czech Republic, France...,” he says.
Another challenge loomed ahead. The train reached Delhi on Sunday at 10 am, during the Janta Curfew hours. Getting transport was a hassle. It cost ₹600 for a five-kilometre auto ride. Shubham started calling a number of hotels: while many were shut, some were apprehensive of foreigners. “Finally, Dhruvin Shah of Datstop Hostel in Vasant Kunj was welcoming of us. They needed to see the health certificate, which we provided,” he says. Since then, Shubham and his ragtag group of 15 travellers have made the hostel their base, till they can be evacuated back to their countries.
“I shared my number on Instagram (his page is Shubyatra), so anyone who is stranded, Indian or foreigner, can call me for help. I have been getting 50-plus calls every day,” says Shubham, who has also helped travellers find accommodation in other cities. For example, a group of Filipinos are stuck in Mumbai. Shubham helped them find space at Nap on Map, in Santacruz. “They didn’t

have enough money left, so I am sponsoring their stay and food for now. I spent from what I had saved for my project and then also received help from my friends and a few donors on Instagram,” he says.
Part of his daily routine also involves picking up groceries and other essentials. “Some of the ATMs are not working in Delhi and a lot of shops insist on Paytm or Google Pay, which the foreigners don’t have. So it is better that I go out and run these errands.”
Recently, he received messages from Indian students in Ukraine and a few in Cebu, Philippines. “I am using what I like to call reverse connections. I ask the foreigners I have helped here to connect Indians stranded in their countries with their friends and other people who can help,” he says, adding that is how the ones in the Philippines found a place. “Social media connections also help,” he adds.
Shubham is currently busy with evacuations. He is helping French nationals reach the airport for an evacuation to France today. “A bus just came from Dharamshala, filled with French travellers who were holidaying there. Germany did an evacuation a couple of days ago and Israel before that,” he says.
Shubham understands that these are testing times. His new-found friends, who are still here, are traumatised by the experience. To keep them occupied during this phase of lockdown, he along with Dhruvin organises movie nights, yoga sessions, quizzes, cooking nights, so that everyone feels comforted and at home. After all, it is one world and everyone is in this together.",society
Chennai’s photographers are keeping the community buzzing during lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennais-photographers-are-keeping-the-community-buzzing-during-lockdown/article31204882.ece,"Be it a golden stream of sunlight that passes through the cracks in a door, rendered in monochrome, or a rolled-up stack of old newspapers that is oddly satisfying to look at — there are latent frames that often go unnoticed in our own homes. 
The Chennai Photowalk, a city-based community of photography enthusiasts, seem to be missing its Sunday photowalks now more than ever. So, for the past two weeks, members have been getting together virtually in an effort to keep at their hobby, even during the time of lockdown. And one such Sunday event was to discover the hidden frames within the four walls of their homes, which gave birth to some of the ones described above. 
It was on March 22 that the group decided to go digital with its events: “The participants were asked to click pictures and post them on our Facebook and Instagram handles, that pertain to each theme, within two hours. We changed the themes every two hours,” Naveen Kumar, one of the organisers at The Chennai Photowalk, says.
The first topic was ‘patterns at home’ followed by ‘fun with family’, ‘creativity in kitchen’ and ‘storytelling’. Each of the topics saw some interesting compositions — for instance, under the theme storytelling, one of the participants had set up a light, in front of which was a toy depicting a boy and a girl, holding hands. Through this simple frame, the photographer intended to recreate a moonlit night awash with love. “Like this, we had close to 150-plus registrations. By April, we’ll have a jury that will look at the pictures and announce the winner,” continues Naveen.
Yesterday, in its second run, The Chennai Photowalk, announced a virtual bus ride for its participants. And for this, it had chosen route number 1, that travels from Thiruvanmiyur to Ennore from 9 am to 7 pm. The virtual bus stopped at specific locations every hour: this was also when the participants sprung into action. They were expected to post images of that specific area, which were clicked in the past, within the one-hour window. The winners for each stop would be announced later.
“For our second activity, we wanted to do something around the city. Every time you look at an image clicked by you, you are transported back to that location and the memories you had there. This is precisely the objective behind this exercise,” says Naveen. The bus ride saw more than 80 passengers, and received 1,100 pictures in 10 hours, all shared digitally.
Naveen confirms that they plan to do such activities every Sunday. Amid the bout of creatives that have appeared online now, The Chennai Photowalk promises to find its own way to keep its community of photographers occupied, he concludes.

Bricks fall apart for construction sector,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-spells-doom-for-construction-industry/article31211507.ece,"The construction industry, which generally gets busy in the January to March quarter, has been severely impacted by the spread of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown, industry executives said.
From the time the WHO and Government of India declared the outbreak a pandemic, the construction industry experienced work disruptions and gradual lockdowns of its operations, said a spokesman for the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, one of India’s largest construction companies.
“After the lockdowns were declared, all site activities in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra have come to a grinding halt. This includes government as well as private projects,” the spokesperson said.
“Material supplies have stopped, and key subcontractors were unable to arrange resources for construction activities. All mobilised resources and plant and machinery are idling. Construction programmes have also been impacted due to these work stoppages,” he added.
Work involving imported items and foreign construction crews have also been impacted.
The COVID-19 crisis will seriously impact revenues of construction companies and almost all of them will face huge financial losses in the months to come, company officials said.
“The financial stress upon the construction sector is expected to worsen over the coming year. It is too early to estimate the full financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis,” they added. 
“Even after the crisis is contained and work resumes, hopefully by end of April 2020, it would take another 7-8 months for things to return to normal,” the Shapoorji Pallonji company spokesperson said. “Moreover, the upcoming monsoon will additionally and severely obstruct construction works June 2020 onwards,” the spokesperson added.
Srini Srinivasan, MD, India, Project Management Institute (PMI) said, “As the COVID-19 spread escalated in China in early January, it became evident that we are facing an unprecedented crisis.” “We do expect a slowdown in the April-June quarter. However, if COVID-19 is controlled by the end of the second quarter, we will see a rebound in the third and fourth quarters for PMI,” he said.
The pandemic has already had a considerable impact on the Indian housing sector. 
Residential sales saw a 42% drop in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a year earlier, latest data from Anarock Property Consultants showed.
“In the first quarter of 2020, residential sales in the top 7 cities stood at 45,200 units, against 78,510 units a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, housing sales fell 24%,” Anarock chairman Anju Puri said. 
“Meanwhile, new launches too fell by 42% annually from 70,480 units in Q1 2019 to approximately 41,200 in Q1 2020. Quarter-on-quarter supply also declined by approximately 21%,” he added.",business

“Based on its assessment, if the credit rating agency (CRA) is of the view that the delay in payment of interest or principal has arisen solely due to the lockdown conditions creating temporary operational challenges in servicing debt, including due to procedural delays in approval of moratorium on loans by the lending institutions, CRA may not consider the same as a default event,” SEBI said.
 This will also be applicable on any rescheduling in payment of debt obligation done by the issuer, prior to the due date, with the approval of investors or lenders, it added.
 The relaxation has been extended till the period of moratorium given by the RBI.
 In addition, the regulator has also given relaxations to rating agencies from certain disclosures requirements.
 Considering that the CRAs are dependent on issuers and third parties for information collection which may be impaired due to current lockdown, SEBI has given relaxation from timelines for rating action or issue of press release by rating agencies.
 However, CRAs should endeavour to finish the exercise on a best effort basis. Such cases will be put up for ratification by the rating sub-committee of the board of CRAs.
 Further, an extension of 30 days has been granted for making annual and semi-annual disclosures by CRAs on their websites for the periods ending March 31, 2020.",business

‘Kannamoochi’ review: Too convenient for horror and too convoluted for a thriller,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannamoochi-web-series-review/article31207597.ece,"(Spoilers ahead)
Given the number of abysmal content — at least from the ones I have watched so far — being uploaded on OTT platforms in the name of web series, it is fair to conclude that Tamil filmmakers haven’t figured out a way to work around the format. Also given the number of preposterous web series available in Tamil, you tend to appreciate every little effort shown by the filmmaker to break the content clutter. Like the brilliantly-executed stretch that comes towards the fag end of Episode One of Kannamoochi.
It is a Holy Week procession that reconstructs the events leading to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. We see Christ struggling to carry the cross (read: weight of mankind) and is whipped and lashed by men who, we believe, are Roman soldiers in this context. The visual tone seems to suggest that it is dreamy, with Sundaramurthy KS’ single note score aiding this effect. The Passion of the Christ, if one were to call it that, is intercut with an image of Satan, laughing and mocking at the procession.
This is where Priya’s (Poorna, playing Poorna) five-year-old daughter Aishwarya goes missing. The scene does not just end there. Priya’s search for her daughter goes in vain and she finds herself caught in the middle of Jesus Christ and Satan — as if she has been pawned off in a war between gods and demons. It is brilliant for two reasons. For one, it is an unusual way of setting up the tension for a simple case of Gone Girl, even for a web series. And two, the sequence seems allegorical to the larger point of Kannamoochi: sins and sinners. But this Church procession, as Priya calls it, is the only rewarding quality of Kannamoochi, which is too convenient for horror and too convoluted for a thriller.
Priya moves into a luxury apartment with her daughter, who is speech-impaired. She is a single mother and an IT employee — only this much we know of her and only this much Poorna is given on paper. She is left to take care of the family when her husband (who comes across as a loving man) passes away due to pancreatic cancer. There is a huge portrait of her husband in the house. His eyes peer into the room, as if he is still the guiding light of the family. But the series has nothing to do with Priya or her husband, but Aishwarya. The mother-daughter duo lives on the ninth floor. But whenever they take the elevator, it stops at the sixth floor almost by design. In other words, this is Tamil cinema’s way of writing whoo... so scary… stuff. These initial scenes are seriously off-putting, given how lame they are — both in terms of the shock factor and staging (side note: If you cannot get actors/dubbing artistes to speak English with a fake urban accent, kindly refrain from going to the remarkable extent of writing dialogues in English, for ‘urbane’ characters).
KannamoochiCast: Poorna, Vivek Prasanna, Amzath Khan and Bose VenkatDirector: Avinaash HariharanGenre: Horror-thriller
But Kannamoochi gets moderately interesting when Aishwarya goes missing. She is not the first one to go missing. When all hope is lost, Priya chances upon a mysterious girl with an Anniyan haircut. She knows where Aishwarya is, but would only disclose the location if and when Priya plays a game of kannamochi (hide and seek). She forces Priya to recite the kannamochi song: “Kannamoochi re re, kandupidi yaaru... arakan vaaran pathuko.” Priya’s quest, is to find that Arakan or Satan. If you have not yawned already, we are still at Episode Two and have three more to go. You sense a familiarity when the spirit of a child appears. You expect the series to traverse a known path, but it takes the Yaavarum Nalam route, to establish the case of a missing family and justice for the sins committed. The sinner here is a paedophile and let us call him Mr R.
Written by Aadthiya GR (Mysskin’s brother), Kannamoochi can be seen as a companion piece to Psycho, which also dealt with an Arakan in the form of a psychopath. Psycho ruminates on morality and justice, and portrayed the killer with a sympathetic gaze. There, it was about a woman leading a psychopath to the path of salvation. Here, it is about a woman who leaves no room for such thoughts and wants to vanquish the sinner altogether. Like Psycho, there is a climax ritual where Priya unearths the Chamber of Secrets. Again, it is a good construct but offers very little beyond the obvious.
It is hard to not think of Mindhunter while watching Kannamoochi, for you could hear Avinaash Hariharan screaming that he is a David Fincher fan and has binged on the show. Of course, the series bears no similarities to Fincher’s masterpiece, but pays a fanboy hat-tip to Mindhunter by its design — pay attention to the opening credits. Every episode begins with a two-minute preface about an insignificant (and impotent?) man showing paedophilic characteristics — which might seem inconsequential at first but has an effective pay-off in the end, when Avinaash knits the various events together. But unlike Mindhunter, which was far superior, far serious and far procedural, the idea for Kannamoochi rests heavily on the subject matter and does not go beyond that.
Nevertheless, Avinaash keeps the spirit of the series intact. I liked the gag between Priya and her husband when the former says, “If you can’t help your wife, you have to ‘help’ yourself.” I also liked the cheeky comment that Mr R makes when a little girl is chided for messing up the room. He instinctively says, “It’s our mess. We’ll clean it,” with a grin on his face. I laughed when Mr R sang ‘You’re my Honeybunch’ in the climax ritual. The problem with Kannamoochi is that it treats the psychopath too apologetically, reducing him to a piece of textual information. I wished it had been more explicit than being suggestive.
Kannamoochi is currently streaming on Zee5",movies

How actor Akshith SK is dealing with the delay of his debut film during the COVID-19 lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-actor-akshith-sk-is-dealing-with-the-delay-of-his-debut-film-during-the-covid-19-lockdown/article31205654.ece,"Son of veteran actor Shashi Kumar, Akshith, was all set to have a dream launch this month, when the Covid-19 decided to play spoilt sport and brought the entire nation into a lock-down. The young actor’s film is titled Seethayana — a bilingual in Kannada and Telugu (Seethayanam). The film, directed by Prabhakar Aaripaka will later be released in Tamil in a dubbed version. Akshith is paired opposite Anahita Bhushan, who also makes her debut with this film, which is produced by Lalitha Rajyalakshmi.
Akshith speaks to MetroPlus about how he feels about his debut film and what he is doing to keep himself busy during the lockdown.







Excerpts
Tell us about Seethayana
The film is very special to me. However this is my second film. The first was Modave. We started the film in March 2019 and suddenly it got stalled. It was falling into a dump. It hurt. Then after eight months, I got this offer and was cheerful, and now this Covid-19 thing happened.
How do you feel now about your second film also being delayed...
What has happened is very unfortunate, but safety and lives are more important. We need people to be safe first. What is the use of a world if there are no people left to enjoy it?
How do you keep yourself busy during the lockdown?







We are all playing almost every board game at home. l feel like a child all over again. I am playing pranks and irritate my mother a lot. Sometimes I help her with the household chores like chopping vegetables or mopping the house and generally keeping the spirit of others at home up with my antiques. (laughs the 24-year-old actor).
How challenging is it to find a footing in the industry being Shashi Kumar’s son ?
Nepotism does not work in the industry. Being a star-son, does not guarantee that I am welcomed with a red carpet. Even I need to work hard, prove I am talented and have a lot of patience. Just because my father was a popular hero during his time does not guarantee people will accept me.
What changes do you see in the industry since you have been a part of it since you were a child?
The changes I see are the manner in which films are being made. They are more realistic and the camera work is brilliant. I never imagined the Kannada industry to boom up with such power. It is good as everyone in every area is open to change, adapt themselves to new ideas and technology and strive to give it their best.
Tell us a bit about your character in Seethayana.
My character, Rahul, in the film is very contrary to the one that I am in real life. He is very serious and takes rational decisions. And the hash-tag for the film is ‘respect women’. It is not a woman-oriented film but portrays women in a very different manner. If I say more then you will get the gist of the story, so we will leave it at that.",movies

 However, the actor-producer didn’t disclose the date and time of the show’s re-run, he asked fans to wait for the announcement.
 Khanna, who was already a household names thanks to his role as the duty-bound Bhishma in BR Chopra’s “Mahabharat”, found another fan base among children in the late 1990s as Shaktimaan and his alter ego “Pandit Gangadhar Vidhyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri”, a photographer for the newspaper Aaj Ki Aawaz.
“Shaktimaan” aired on DD 1 from 1997 to 2005.
 It was later translated into different languages and aired on different channels.

He is the protagonist of the short film, Kadar, which was launched on YouTube today. The film is the brainchild of wildlife travel operator Pravin Shanmughanandam. The film has been scripted and directed by Pankaj Singh of Faraway Originals, which makes films about unsung heroes from across the country.
It all began four years ago, when Pravin surveyed a private coffee estate. “We were looking for a good trail in the rainforests and found this 175-acre coffee estate that the owners had given over to re-foresting. So far, the area had been open only to researchers and scientists,” says Pravin. While they were okay with walks and trails on that land, the owners did not want it to become a stomping ground for marauding tourists.
It was the perfect fit. “The biodiversity here is amazing; the forests are spectacular with their trees, streams and waterfalls. But I also wanted it to be all about the local inhabitants. Then, in 2016, I met Loganathan,” says Pravin, adding that he became his constant companion on his tours. Loganathan became a tour guide as he accompanied Pravin’s groups into the forest and shared with them his exhaustive knowledge about the flora and fauna there.
Stories from IndiaFaraway Originals is a collective of Bengaluru-based storytellers, writers, artists and filmmakers who create original films from across India about art and history, sport and movement, the natural world and conservation. They seek incredible tales and craft them into narratives that bring to the fore, unexplored perspectives, unheard voices and unseen expressions, hidden in plain sight.

At nights, sitting around a campfire in the forest, Loganathan would tell Pravin about the animals he shared the forests with and a lot of jungle lore. “His mother, wife, daughter, cousin and his wife and he are the only people looking after the estate. Only the Kadars can live in the leech-infested rainforest,” he says. During one of his trips, Pravin noticed that Loganathan had fitted a new door to his home. “I asked him about it and he said, ‘An elephant did that, so we changed the door.’ Nothing else! I had to prise the details out.”
When Pankaj heard the story of the tusker breaking into Logananthan’s home in the dead of night forcing him to escape into the forest with his family, “we decided it was a story to tell,” he says. “The script is from Loganathan’s point of view; in first person. It recreates what happened that night and what Loganathan made of the incident.”

Pravin says it was not easy convincing Loganathan to agree to the film. “The Kadars do not interact much with city dwellers, and here were some ‘urban people’ who suddenly wanted to make a movie about him,” says Pravin. Filming in the forest was challenging. “We had to trek uphill in the night to check the landscape. It had rained, we were slipping, sliding and falling, with minimal rain gear… there was a lot of hiking and trekking and going across unused trails. It is a completely isolated terrain.”
The film crew consisted of just four members: three from the Faraway Originals and Pravin. “There was no big crew or big lights…We spent a lot of time with Loganathan, listening to him and his mother while we ate together. Only when he warmed up did we start filming. We did it in just one and a half days,” recalls Pankaj.
While the film was about a tusker entering Loganathan’s home, the team had to work out a way to tell the story without an elephant. After all, there was no way they could conjure up a tusker. “Visually, we planned it so that we did not have to show the animal. There are many ways to portray the mood,” says Pankaj. Indeed, the anxiety, fear and suspense are tangible when watching the film. The elephant is always there, just out of the frame.
Pankaj wrote the narrative in English and Pravin narrated it in Tamil. “We decided to go with the local language because it had more impact. There are English sub-titles,” says Pravin.
Kadar releases on YouTube today. “Everybody has a story,” says Pankaj, “only they often do not recognise it as an amazing one. Loganathan’s was one of them.” For Pravin, what stood out was Loganathan’s response to the tusker incident. “This is who I am; this is my life that I share with the creatures of the forest. That night I was scared. As scared and intimidated as I am when I go into town and a bus conductor asks me for my ticket.”

‘The Office’ reunion: John Krasinski and Steve Carell bond on YouTube show ‘Some Good News’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-office-reunion-john-krasinski-and-steve-carell-bond-on-youtube-show-some-good-news/article31204812.ece,"Hollywood star John Krasinski wants to spread some good news by bringing positive stories as the world battles coronavirus pandemic.
The actor-director launched ‘Some Good News’ on YouTube, featuring his former “The Office” co-star Steve Carell.
Krasinki, whose sequel to “A Quiet Place” has been postponed due to the virus spread, said he wanted to talk about stories that made people feel good or smile and turns out there were plenty that fans had to share with the actor.
The actor had put up a colorful logo of “SGN”, which he said his two daughters had made.
“For years now, I’ve been wondering, why is there not a news show dedicated entirely to good news? Well, desperately seeking my fix somewhere else, I reached out to all of you this week, asking — nay, begging — for some good news. And boy, did you deliver.”
“After reading those replies and the incredibly heartwarming stories that came with them, I thought, ‘All right. Enough is enough, world. Why not us? Why not now?’ So, ladies and gentleman, this is your fault, and this is SGN. I’m John Krasinski, and if it isn’t clear yet, I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing,” the actor said at the start of the video.
 




 
Krasinski said “we all are going through an incredibly trying time” but the human spirit had “found a way to break through and blow us all away“.
He then went on to highlight the stories that people had shared with him, of public cheering for the health care workers, neighbours helping out each other and a grandfather meeting his grandson for the first time through a window in the age of social distancing.
Krasinski also interviewed a 15-year-old girl named Coco whose neighbours cheered for her from the streets as she finished her final chemo treatment.
The actor, who shot to fame as Jim Halpert in “The Office”, interviewed Steve Carell, who played his boss Michael Scott on the show.
Krasinski reminded Carell that this would be the 15th anniversary of the show as they shared anecdotes from their time on the drama.
The “Jack Ryan” star said fans have been clamoring for a cast reunion, but at this time he just wants the pandemic to end so that the team can have an off camera reunion “as people, just to say hi.”
Carell also joked to Krasinski: “I guarantee you that the bottom half of what you have on does not match the top,” referring his suit and tie, as Krasinski laughed and joked he was wearing Jam pants.
As the actor stood up after signing off from the show, he, indeed was wearing pants that did not match with the top half of his suit.",movies
"Marvel should release ‘Black Widow’ digitally, says David Harbour",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/marvel-should-release-black-widow-digitally-says-david-harbour/article31204145.ece,"Stranger Things star David Harbour has suggested Marvel Studios to release his upcoming film Black Widow online amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 Starring Scarlett Johansson in the title role, the film which was scheduled to be released on May 1, has been postponed until further notice.
In a live Instagram Q&A session, Harbour said he was shocked to find out about the delay in the release.
“My publisher also sent me an email saying ‘Black Widow’ had been postponed and I think I replied ‘shocker’,” the actor, who plays Red Guardian in the Cate Shortland-directed MCU film, said.
“Wouldn’t it be fun if we all could just stream it? But that’s above my pay grade,” Harbour, 44, added.
 The actor also said the pandemic has delayed the release of “Stranger Things” season four.
 Marvel has also postponed Amy Adams-starrer “The Woman in the Window”, a 20th Century title and “The Personal History of David Copperfield”, featuring Dev Patel, from its Searchlight banner, which were supposed to debut on April 15 and May 8, respectively.
 It is unclear when any of these films will be released.
 Globally, there are 652,079 confirmed COVID19 cases and more than 30,000 people have died of the disease. ",movies
The cost of the lockdown is pegged at about $120 billion,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/the-cost-of-the-lockdown-is-pegged-at-about-120-billion/article31211546.ece,"The complete 21-day COVID-19 shutdown of most economic activity has created new roadblocks, causing severe disruptive impact on both demand and supply side elements across sectors. The cost of the lockdown is pegged at around $120 billion (approximately ₹9 lakh crore) or 4% of the GDP.
Further, 90% of India’s workforce is employed in the unorganised sector and this lockdown will effectively put over 45 million migrants living off daily earnings out of work. Sectors like construction projects, mobility services, housekeeping and other informal sector employment will come to a sudden halt. The manufacturing sector faces a triple challenge. First, there are going to be serious supply chain disruptions not just when dealing with foreign parties, but also the domestic industry. Second, sectors like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, chemical products etc., are facing an imminent raw material and component shortage. 
Third, the shutdown and resulting loss of revenue is certain to cause a number of bankruptcies and closures, especially in the MSME sector with corresponding disruption to supply chains.
On the demand side, several industries would get impacted starting with the consumer durable goods and will cascade to other intermediate goods and basic goods. The government was the major spender on investment in the infrastructure sector, which will slowdown now with resources and attention being diverted.
Hence, industries like steel and cement, which did well, last year, will stumble. 
The services sector will see a fall in demand. These include aviation, hotels, restaurants, tourism, retail malls etc. The real estate sector, which was already in deep trouble, could well slide even more,in the medium term at least.
Even 10-20% job losses among its 7.3 million employees in restaurants across the country would mean up to 15 lakh unemployed. Any delay in addressing the economic consequences will lead to massive job losses.
SICCI suggests the following: the Reserve Bank of India has to address two problems: Transmission on rate cuts has been inadequate. 
Second, rate cuts by themselves are unlikely to stimulate demand as the primary cause for demand contraction will be on account of consumer confidence being low. Though the RBI has provided some relief to industries, it is inadequate considering the gravity of the situation. SICCI feels that only the stronger firms in any sector can have the capacity to keep salary payments going, in the absence of any revenue earnings. 
Firms cannot be expected to drain their already stretched cash-flows. To tide over the present crisis, banks should give three months’ salary as overdraft facility to the employees of companies which can be escrowed to the companies with a nominal rate of interest not exceeding 3%.
The same could be recovered from companies over a period of three months, six months after commencement of production, post the present crisis. On electronic component and semi-conductor industry, the impact will be felt in the areas of logistics, packaging and testing. A special package should be designed for this highly skilled industry.
In the case of contract workers, many casual and informal workers are directly or indirectly dependent on the survival of small and medium enterprises for jobs. 
The government could lend support through tax holidays and zero-interest loans for three months. In the case of services sector, the government should consider contributing the employer’s share of PF for all employees earning less than ₹20,000 per month and ESI contribution for all employees earning below the statutory threshold level of ₹21,000 per month, for a period of 12 months. For firms that have difficulties in managing their cash flows, the government should extend a government-backed loan guarantee, on the basis of which firms can raise loans on preferential terms to the extent of 25% of their existing working capital arrangements. All rating agencies may be advised to suspend rating reviews till the lockdown is over. The RBI needs to come up with a special window to provide liquidity to NBFCs and microfinance institutions in this period. The government should ensure that all refunds across tax legislation — up to75% should be given without any verification and any wrongful claim can be recovered without any interest.
Private sector hospitals need to be encouraged to provide specific number of isolation wards to the poor and extended financial assistance on soft terms.
Export incentive schemes like Sec. 10AA for SEZ units under the I-T Act should be extended for one more year – i.e up to March 31, 2021. Further, the recent Import Export Policy should be extended for one more year.
In the absence of new Export/Import Policy, all export incentives viz MEIS,SCIS, EPCG license etc. should be extended for one more year. All charges including, port charges, penal charges, demurrages should be waived. Further, all agencies viz ports, air cargo terminals, all custodians of cargo and all shipping lines have to waive penal charges.
Fixed charges levied may be waived and the industry may be charged only on the actual consumption of electricity. Immediate refund of IGST will help exporter in dealing with liquidity issues.
In order to have Business Continuity Plans where the economy is better prepared for a work from home mode, the government should halve GST rates on all laptops, routers, cloud services, dongles and such other equipment and services.
All companies should be asked to devote their CSR funds exclusively towards creation of clean quarantine centres, and addition of hospital beds, ventilators and PPEs, besides investing in testing and other facilities aimed at preventing the spread of the virus.
High Networth Individuals should be encouraged to do likewise. Additional tax concessions may be looked at for this sector. Women’s Self-Help Groups and the informal sector should be asked to produce masks, hand sanitisers, among others in a big way. Banks should be asked fund these activities and State governments should arrange for the marketing of these products to their local primary health centres.

MFI collection to be hit most by lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/mfi-collection-to-be-hit-most-by-lockdown/article31211164.ece,"Rating agency Crisil has said the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 will have near- term impact on collections and fresh-loan disbursements of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and the micro finance institutions (MFIs) , in particular. 
The agency said MFIs will be the most impacted because collection of repayments involves visit to households, such borrowers typically have weak credit profiles and their income generation activities would be disrupted.
Home loans will be less affected as a majority of the borrowers are salaried and collections are through auto-debit instructions though affordable housing loans could witness challenges because of higher proportion of self-employed borrowers, whose income streams have been affected by the lockdown.
 Vehicle finance would also face challenges in commercial vehicle loans because curtailed traffic will lead to weak earnings for fleet operators, Crisil said.
“We see the impact continuing after the lockdown ends, based on the profile of borrowers. Those self-employed, in informal jobs, and earning their salary in cash would bear the brunt beyond the near term because the economy will take time to recover,” said Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director, Crisil CRISIL Ratings. 
The rating agency has already lowered its GDP growth estimate to 3.5% for fiscal 2021 from the 5.2% earlier.
It said any delay in return to normalcy will put pressure on collections and asset-quality metrics and any change in the behaviour of borrowers on payment discipline can affect delinquency levels.
“Disbursement of fresh loans will reduce substantially in the near team and remain muted in the medium term given the expected challenges on the economic front,” Crisil said. ",economy
TRAI to telcos: Extend prepaid validity so users get uninterrupted services during lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/trai-to-telcos-extend-prepaid-validity-so-users-get-uninterrupted-services-during-lockdown/article31204246.ece," Sector regulator TRAI has asked telecom operators to extend the validity period of prepaid users to ensure that subscribers get uninterrupted services during the 21-day nationwide lockdown.
 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has also sought details of the steps being taken to ensure availability of uninterrupted telecom services to such customers on a “priority basis“.
”...you are required to take necessary steps as deemed fit including extending the validity period to ensure that all prepaid subscribers can enjoy uninterrupted services during the period of lockdown,” TRAI said in a communication to all operators on Sunday.
 The communication on “measures regarding ensuring availablity of recharge vouchers and payment options for prepaid services” comes in the backdrop of 21-day lockdown imposed in the country to deal with the outbreak and spread of coronavirus pandemic.
“Though the telecommunication services have been considered as essential services and thus granted an exception from closing down... However, lock down may adversely affect the working of customer service centres/point of sale locations,” TRAI said.
The regulator added: “Under the circumstances, it is quite possible that those subscribers who wish to top up their prepaid balances or wish to extend subscription to a prepaid tariff using offline channels may face hardships and/or disruption of services.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, announced a complete lockdown of the entire country for 21 days in an unprecedented move to try halt the spread of the pandemic, shortly after which the Centre said road, rail and air services will remain suspended during this period.

Air purifying technology to disinfect State hospitals in COVID-19 fight ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/air-purifying-technology-to-disinfect-state-hospitals-in-covid-19-fight/article31211178.ece,"
The Department of Science and Technology (DST) on Monday said that an air purifying technology developed by an incubatee company of the Pune-based Science and Technology Park (STP or Scitech Park) could offer an effective solution to the country’s fight against the coronavirus COVID-19 contagion by reducing the viral load of the infected areas.
ICMR invites quotations from manufacturers for COVID-19 test kits
The DST, in a release on Monday, announced that it has released a sum of ₹1crore to manufacture and scale up the product titled ‘Scitech Airon’ and that 1,000 units of this new air purifier would soon be ready for installation in various hospitals across Maharashtra.
The technology has been developed under the ‘Nidhi Prayas’ programme initiated by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). Another city-based company, J-Clean Weather Tech, is manufacturing the product.
“The negative ion generator titled ‘Scitech Airon’ helps to control the virus, bacteria, and other fungal infections in a closed environment and could help purify the air and disinfect areas around COVID-19 positive cases and suspects. Hence it could ensure the wellbeing of the staff, doctors, and nurses who are working round the clock in quarantine facilities by enhancing their disease-resistance power and ability to fight the virus,” said the DST release.
Isolation is India’s best weapon: ICMR
According to Dr. Rajendra Jagdale, Director General of STP, a single hour of operation of the ion generator machine, which costs around ₹40,000 including GST, has the potential to reduce viral load within a room by 99.7% depending upon its size.
The air purifier is compact in form, weighing a mere 9 kg and barely 1.5 feet in height, a foot wide and ten inches deep, rendering it highly convenient for use in enclosed spaces like hospitals, clinics, flats and other spaces like railways, airports and theatres to make them “virus-free” zones, the release said.
The ionizer machine generates negatively charged ions at approximately hundred million per 8 seconds (10 ions per sec).
Why are only a fraction of cases tested?
The negative ions generated by the ionizer form clusters around microparticles such as airborne mould, corona or influenza viruses, bacteria among other pollutants and renders them inactive through a complex chemical reaction by creating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and atmospheric detergents (hydroxyl groups are composed of one hydrogen atom bonded to one oxygen atom and denoted as -OH or HO-).
The detergent property thus generated by the ion generator aids the breakdown of the outer protein of the allergens, viruses and bacteria, thus checking airborne diseases and increasing the body’s resistance to possible infections, the release said.",science

With explosive spread affecting approximately over 5,50,000 people and a mortality of more than 25,000 persons the world over, it is now a global calamity. The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is Government of India’s autonomous institution for research and development in disease biology that in addition also does extensive public health services.　
Also read: Researchers in India must join the fight against COVID-19
Kerala holds an entire conjoining geography with the Western Ghats forests considered as the source of emergence and persistence of several virus infections such as Kysanur Forest Disease, dengue, chikungunya and more recently Nipah in the country. The vulnerability of Kerala as an entry point of novel viruses into the country or emergence of new infections also come from the fact that it has one of the highest numbers of expatriates working in all parts of the world, especially in the Middle East; its direct global connectivity owing to the presence of four international airports; its global reputation as a preferred tourist destination; and a tropical climate with high rain, humidity and temperature with proximity to rain forests of the Western Ghats. With excellent state-of-the-art infrastructure, the RGCB has now set up a clear clinical and discovery research roadmap on COVID-19 to support outbreak management and maximise benefit to the public. 　
The current approach to diagnose SARS CoV-2 infection is by Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) using real-time reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) screening of samples collected from patients. The RGCB is also such an approved testing facility. This test is costly, time-consuming and not adaptable to large-scale screening to avoid disease spread to other individuals. Antibody detection tests cannot be used in the early phase of the disease as these molecules are elicited at least 5-7 days after the onset of symptoms, by which time transmission to others will have already occurred. Also, there are no available alternative tests for early diagnosis or prediction of severity. The RGCB has one of the best proteomic facilities in the country that will be put to use for biomarker identification. The RGCB has designed analysis of early and late plasma samples from COVID-19 patients to identify protein markers for developing alternative tests for diagnosis and prediction of severity.　
The SARS CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is capable of undergoing rapid genetic changes. In a pandemic situation, where large numbers of people are affected, chances of mutation are significantly increased. Once characterised, the RGCB will correlate observed mutations with disease severity and neutralisation antibody response. This is critical for efficient design of vaccines and predicting severity of future outbreaks in new geographical areas and their management.　
Our worst fear at present is whether a community spread has already started, thereby taking India into the third stage of the COVID-19. Naturally, checking this is a priority. Rather than directly going into the community for verification at this stage, we strategically planned two hospital-based approaches. Since patients with severe COVID-19 develop viral pneumonia, to appraise the SARS-CoV-2 transmission situation in Kerala, a Statewide pneumonia-screening programme is being done. Initially, 10 sentinel hospitals from the government and private sector will be selected in each district. All patients with pneumonia will be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Severe cases will also be tested for Influenza A, Influenza B, H1N1, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human Metapneumo virus, and Adeno virus. The second hospital-based approach would look into SARS CoV-2 antibody responses in the hospital staff, including doctors and nursing staff. They form the target group since they are the people who would have contact with undiagnosed COVID-19 patients and would be ideal sentinels for the study. 　
Another aspect that needs immediate attention being addressed by the RGCB is development of both new drug candidates and drug repurposing of approved drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients. It is now known that ACE2 is the SARS CoV-2 receptor and peptidase that is important to cleave S protein for priming and entry into cells. RGCB will make tagged pseudovirions and track the entry of virus particles into the cells. This will be a model to screen for viral entry inhibitors using endocytosis tools developed in the institute. Also being done at the RGCB is repositioning of existing drugs active against RNA viruses using rapid assays in cell culture and then adapting them to the clinical environment　
Monoclonal antibody therapy using humanised monoclonal antibody (HmAb) therapy is becoming an accepted therapy for infectious diseases. The feasibility of using antibodies from COVID-19-recovered patients in the form of plasma therapy has already been demonstrated in the trials conducted in China. Using immune cells from recovered patients, the RGCB has started protocols for engineered therapeutic humanised monoclonal antibodies against the pandemic. Once developed and scaled up, this will be a valuable biological for treating severe COVID-19 patients.　
India has a rich tradition of Ayurveda and use of natural compounds in acute and chronic disorders. The RGCB recently discovered, characterised and transferred to the industry one such molecule from a plant source for liver cancer. Traditional knowledge and ancient Ayurveda texts describe methods thought to be useful in managing febrile conditions. Modern science assumes that these mostly work through immunomodulation and the RGCB has strong preliminary data for this. Hence, studies evaluating both standard Ayurveda formulations such as Rasayanas and Ghrutams and many natural products for their antiviral and more importantly immunomodulatory properties have started at the RGCB.
The RGCB has proven record in developing rapid antigen-based detection kits for swine fever and snake bite venom detection rapid kits. The RGCB is in the process of developing a highly cost-effective Corona-detection kit, reducing the detection time by nearly half of that of today’s kits. The highlight of this kit, on completion, will be that it can be used in limited resource laboratories that do not have real-time PCR machines, which are costly to procure and operate. A second methodology being developed by the RGCB is field-testing of samples using-RNA based detection completely bypassing the PCR machine, but with the similar sensitivity and specificity of conventional PCR. This capability has already been previously developed and demonstrated in dengue virus detection by the RGCB. In response to “Make In India” call of the Honourable Prime Minister, the RGCB and Kerala Start up Mission manage an excellent technology development incubator called BioNest that currently has 23 start-up companies. The RGCB works very closely with these companies to promote development of low cost new diagnostic kits that can be used as point-of-care tools for rapid diagnosis of Corona virus infection. This will allow widespread screening in the population not possible now with expensive time-consuming methodology.

Opinion | Researchers in India must join the fight against COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/researchers-in-india-must-join-the-fight-against-covid-19/article31204377.ece,"Over the last three months, the world has changed irrevocably. The most-mentioned words around the world in recent weeks have to be coronavirus and COVID-19.
Let’s recap the history of this pandemic. The first known case of the viral infection later called COVID-19 was noticed in the Wuhan City of People’s Republic of China on December 1, 2019. It was dubbed an outbreak on December 12 by the Chinese state broadcaster, and the WHO was notified on December 30 and the viral genome sequence was decoded on January 3, 2020. The events since then are well-known – the virus has spread to 200 countries (areas, territories), resulting in over 4,65,900 confirmed cases as on date.
In India, the first case was detected in Kerala on January 30, 2020, in a student who had come back from China. By this time, it had spread to several countries outside of mainland China, and the WHO declared coronavirus as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’ on January 31.
Till February 29, 2020, three cases were reported in India, all in Kerala. They were swiftly identified and quarantined. This period was the first and perhaps the most important window of opportunity for the research experts and public health specialists to come together and contextualise the available evidence as applicable to the Indian setting in terms of testing, treatment, prophylaxis and mathematical models of transmission and help guide policy.

Looking beyond just diagnosis and quarantine




 

Looking beyond just diagnosis and quarantine

Given that India has a long history of dealing with infections and the existence of a disease surveillance programme for epidemic detection and response since 2004, and the wide expectation that such a pandemic was inevitable (Bill Gates spoke about exactly such a scenario in a 2015 TED talk), the failure of the Indian research community to respond to this imminent threat with sufficient alacrity is surprising. The first reports of coronavirus being noticed by the Indian research community appear in the third week of February. Still, there seems to be little urgency amongst the Indian public health community in trying to predict the impact of this pandemic.
During this time, modelling exercises were going on around the world. The impact of science on policy became apparent when the publication of the Imperial College modelling study forced the British government to abruptly change its policy position from attempting to ‘ride out the storm’ and allowing the population to develop herd immunity to taking urgent steps to suppress the pandemic. In the U.S., the calm visage of Dr Anthony Fauci has had a reassuring effect on the American public, even as the bumbling political response has led to a crisis situation.
The Indian reaction relied heavily on the reactionary approaches to scout for evidence in the middle of a pandemic. To date, only one data modelling on COVID-19 has been published from India. However, this analysis did not focus on predicting the burden or behaviour of COVID-19 but to identify the effect of intervention strategies that were unlikely to work anyway. There was enough evidence that close to 50% of infected individuals would not be detected through the airport thermal check-based screening (the prevalent screening approach in India), and that simply quarantining symptomatic individuals would miss large numbers of infected but asymptomatic individuals. Thus, this report had little likelihood of informing policy development. An editorial in British Medical Journal on the COVID-19 response in South Asia noted “for a region that has sent rockets to Mars and includes two nuclear powers, lack of a single academic centre with the epidemiological expertise to model a rapidly progressing epidemic seems remarkable.”

Coronavirus | Can drugs for Ebola be used to treat COVID-19? 
During this time, global public health experts, including those in the WHO, were stressing of the need to make the testing criteria liberal and adopting strict isolation policies of identified cases, but the official response from the Indian health authorities was to reassure the Indian public that all was well.
It was only after the mayhem in Europe, the drumbeat of voices from the U.K. and U.S., and the appearance of expert opinions on alternative media portals, that the response changed, and the national lockdown was implemented. The official Indian position still denies the existence of community transmission, based on data from random testing. The design and the data that supports this conclusion has been widely questioned, largely on the basis of the small number of subjects samples, which does not truly represent the large and diverse Indian population.
The importance and need of the lockdown at this time is not in doubt. At the time of writing, on the fourth day of lockdown, the number of cases in India stands at 873, with 149 new cases in a single day, a 50% jump over the rise in the previous day. Further, it is unclear whether we are substantially expanding our testing capability. Serological tests are available now, which allow results to become known in a matter minutes. The lockdown will end some day, and its benefits can only be sustained only through a policy of aggressive testing, contact tracing and isolation.
During these testing times, even as the scientific research activity has ground to a halt, coronavirus researchers must remain busy. The basic scientists around the world including in India are trying to understand the fundamental organism and disease biology, developing simple and affordable test kits and vaccines.
We need to find safe and effective intervention strategies, for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The global standard for finding such strategies is through randomised clinical trials. Based on anecdotal experience and pre-clinical data, one candidate molecule for such a trial is hydroxy-chloroquine, used currently for treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases.
In violation of the principle of recommending interventions only after establishing the safety and efficacy, the national taskforce for COVID-19 issued a recommendation advocating empiric use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of this infection in asymptomatic individuals including healthcare workers. The purported evidence they use to support this recommendation is highly speculative, has been criticised as being bad in science, and riddled with conflicts of interest. Standing next to, and despite exhortations from U.S. President Donald Trump, Dr Fauci declined to support its use, pointing out the need for a randomised clinical trial.
The U.K. has restrained the use of this compound outside of a trial. Under pressure, the French authorities allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine and another antiviral drug to treat patients infected with the coronavirus. The recommendation is highly contextual, with the statement from France’s Director General of Health allowing “a temporary authorisation to allow certain patients with coronavirus to benefit from this therapeutic route.” It needs to be emphasised, however, that the authorisation is for treatment of infected individuals, and not prophylaxis.

This advisory has led to a run on this compound, making it disappear from market, putting patients who legitimately need for treatment for other conditions at risk. Moreover, reports of self-medication leading to complications and even deaths have been reported. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has declared hydroxychloroquine as a Schedule H drug, suggesting that it intends to double down on this poorly conceptualised recommendation.
Moreover, this recommendation puts in jeopardy any planned clinical trial of this intervention by removing equipoise (a state of genuine uncertainty regarding the comparative therapeutic merits) which is essential for such investigation. This is at a time when research groups around the world, including the WHO, have started large trials in order to find effective interventions. We have possibly lost an opportunity because the advisory will prompt healthcare providers to adopt this approach, more so to compensate for the shortage of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, with potentially tragic consequences.
There can indeed be genuine tension between research and the urgent desire to help patients with whatever is available during public health emergencies. Some caregivers may feel that providing clinical care and conducting clinical research are incompatible. However, there is a difference between opinion-based advice by a doctor and recommendation from an authoritative body.
During the recent G20 Virtual Summit, India’s Prime Minister underscored the need to put people at the centre, freely and openly share the benefits of medical research and development, develop adaptive, responsive and humane health care systems, and promote new crisis management protocols. U.S. Democratic Presidential contender Joe Biden said in a tweet – “If I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice”.
As the country cowers in fear of COVID-19 and hopes that the lockdown will suppress the spread of the infection and prepare to provide appropriate care to those who might develop its ill-effects, the Indian research community must join the fight and shine the light on the path that leads to good health.

Crisis deepens in All India Chess Federation as president removes secretary ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/crisis-deepens-in-all-india-chess-federation-as-president-removes-secretary/article31222201.ece," The crisis-ridden All India Chess Federation (AICF) plunged into further turmoil when its president P.R. Venketrama Raja removed Bharat Singh Chauhan from the post of secretary of the federation on Monday.
In a three-page letter, dated March 30, addressed to Chauhan, Raja detailed the reasons for his action, and said he had no option but to exercise his “extraordinary powers as the president of AICF under Article 15 (a) of the AICF Constitution and Bye-Laws.”
It may be recalled that the AICF is awaiting a directive from the Madras High Court regarding fresh date of elections of its office-bearers.
In February, Chauhan (secretary), Ajay Patel (president) as well as three others were declared elected unopposed to the principal posts of AICF.
Later, the Madras High Court ordered fresh elections and the Supreme Court dismissed a Special Leave Petition challenging the verdict.
When contacted, Chauhan questioned Raja’s authority and dismissed his action of removing him as a “malicious attempt to cover his tracks.”
He argued, “Raja ceased to be the AICF president from February 11, the date on which the court-appointed Returning Officer declared Mr. Patel as the newly elected AICF president.
“Despite the Hon’ble Madras High Court ordering fresh elections of AICF, Mr. Patel, being the last person to hold the AICF president’s office, remains the interim president till fresh elections are conducted.”
He alleged Raja announced his removal to save All Marathi Chess Association, which was delaying the submission of the accounts for the World Youth Championship held last October.
“AMCA received a State Government grant of ₹2 crore for the championship and did not bother to account for it. Last of my letters seeking AMCA’s response was sent on March 29, and within a day, Raja, without authority, announced my removal.”
In another strange development, 12 affiliates have jointly called for AICF’s Special/Extraordinary General Body Meeting on April 24 in the Capital.
The letter, written on Chandigarh Chess Association’s letterhead claiming representations from 12 States and Union Territories and listing a nine-point agenda, read, “We had sent to Hon. secretary, AICF, a requisition in writing to call a Special/Extraordinary General Body Meeting of AICF as per the rights and powers vested in them under Article 11 of the Constitution of the AICF and Section 28 of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act 1975. As the Hon. secretary of AICF has expressed in a letter dated 29.03.2020 his inability to call such a meeting we have decided to call for the meeting.”",other sports
"Country’s collective willpower will beat COVID-19, says Yogeshwar",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/countrys-collective-willpower-will-beat-covid-19-says-yogeshwar/article31219650.ece,"Olympic bronze medal winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt has a simple solution to the problem of staying confined at home in the time of a nationwide lockdown.
Sharing how his determination helped him stay isolated for six months in South Africa while recovering from a knee surgery, Yogeshwar said the country’s collective willpower would beat the deadly COVID-19 virus.
Failure at the 2008 Beijing Olympics had made Yogeshwar hungrier for success. He travelled to South Africa in 2009 for a surgery to fix his injured knee. The time required for recovery and rehabilitation tested Yogeshwar, who has bagged several medals in top level competitions, including the 2012 London Olympics.
“I spent six months in recovery and rehab. I was almost alone. In those days it was not easy to speak to one’s family over phone. I used to watch whatever Indian films came on television and listened to music to pass my time. My only aim was to recover from the injury and become fully fit. I focused on that to overcome my loneliness.
“Right now, we should aim at beating coronavirus. This will make our stay at home easier. These days we have got so many facilities, including social media, to stay engaged. Spending time with family is another good option,” Yogeshwar told The Hindu.
For Yogeshwar, who joined politics during the Haryana elections last year, social commitments have increased. But he is monitoring all this from home. “In our Gohana village, we are feeding about 2000 to 3000 people every day. We are also trying to extend help to all the needy people in our locality. We have a 12-member team, which is looking into all this.
“Amid all this, we are following the rules of social distancing. The biggest challenge at this moment is helping poor families with food and other basic needs,” said Yogeshwar, who has shut down his wrestling academy to protect the trainees from the virus.
Welcoming the postponement of the Olympics, Yogeshwar expressed confidence that the Indian wrestlers would be unaffected by the one-year delay. 
“All of them have been performing well for the last two-three years. They need to protect themselves from the virus, maintain focus and use the additional time to get back to top form again. They know how to do it, they just need to stay fit,” said Yogeshwar.",other sports

We are videoconferencing with people frequently these days. And one of the top trending platforms is the Zoom videoconferencing app. Today, we look at the app’s security vulnerability, and how you can protect your own virtual conversations with the help of secure VPNs.
And on the other side, engineers are trying to fully charge an electric vehicle in less than 10 minutes for Formula E race in 2022.
Finally, moving to engage kids at home, Spotify launches its Kids service in three countries, and parents are allowing their children to use Facebook’s Messenger Kids app.
Zoom’s privacy policies questioned
As millions of people have been advised to stay at home due to COVID-19, videoconferencing app Zoom has become the mainstay for people to connect with each other.
According to market research firm Sensor Tower, Zoom’s cloud-meetings app is currently the most popular free app for iPhones.
As its popularity grew, so did questions surrounding its privacy and data projection policies. 
In the last few weeks, Zoom’s screen-sharing feature has been exploited by internet trolls. They hijack meetings and interrupt educational sessions leading to what is now called “Zoombombing.” 
New York’s attorney general Letitia James on Monday sent a letter to the company asking if it has taken any new security measure to handle the surge in traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a report by New York Times.
The letter outlined several concerns on the company’s slow response to security vulnerabilities on its platform. These gaps could allow malicious third-parties to gain access to users’ cameras.
Zoom had updated its privacy policy on Sunday after users reported concerns, and Monday, its chief executive and founder Eric Yuan said in a statement that the company has taken its users’ privacy, security and trust extremely seriously.
“We appreciate the New York attorney general’s engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information,” the statement added.
Protecting yourself online with VPNs
As most of us communicate online, it is important to send and receive messages and data over secured networks. 
Most public networks are not secure. They easy targets for people trying to snoop on your data that is sent unencrypted. Accessing a website that doesn’t use HTTPS will make your communication vulnerable to malicious attacks.
A secure website is marked by a green lock icon. If this lock is missing, anyone can view the data you send. So, using a private network helps keep your data safe.
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is like a tunnel that you can use to pass through a public network. It helps protect your data in transit from hackers or scamsters. It keeps both encrypted and unencrypted data safe. By changing your IP address, it also protects your privacy to an extent.
So, here are some VPN providers that have been tested by WIRED. They have all been independently audited and have published their results. 
ExpressVPN: is known for not keeping customer logs. At one point of time, it failed to produce records on customers in courts even after the Turkish government seized its servers. It costs $6.67 a month for a one year upfront purchase.
TunnelBear: It has a bear animation explaining what a VPN does and what it doesn’t. It also offers the same security features as other VPN providers with a no-logging policy. It costs $4.99 per month for a one year up front purchase.
Mullvad VPN: The Sweden-based company offers total anonymity so you can generate a random account number, write it down and mail it along with cash to Sweden. And no one can connect the sender to the random account. It costs $5.60 per month.

Charging an electric car in about the same time as filing gas
Tesla and Porsche have recently deployed 250-kilowatt public charging stations. These charging units can power some vehicles to full charge in about 40 minutes. That’s a big leap considering how long it used to take for battery vehicle to get charged fully.
Now, as if a 40-minute full charge isn’t short enough, Formula E officials want new cars in the all-electric racing series to pack a full charge in about 10 minutes.
The team had announced the specs for their third-generation all-electric race cars that will debut on the motorway in two years.
Increasing the battery charging rate is a function of how fast lithium ions flow from the cathode to the anode, and how much ion the anode can hold. 
Making thicker anodes solved the part of the equation on the storage, but the flow of ions sometimes gets slower as they can’t penetrate the anode fast enough while charging. This delay causes a molecular traffic jam, making lithium to stay on the surface, leading to a phenomenon called lithium-plating. 
To solve the flow part, engineers are planning to add silicon to the anode, instead of graphite. According to a review paper on eTransportation, silicon can change the anode’s crystal structure in a way that makes lithium plating less likely.
Enevate, an energy storage company, has been working on this for the last 15 years with pure silicon anode. The company’s researchers announced that their latest generation of batteries could be charged to 75% in just five minutes, according to a report by WIRED.

Spotify’s standalone app Kids, aimed at kid-friendly music and stories, is being broadly made available in the U.S., Canada and France, the company announced on Tuesday.
The app debuted in Ireland last fall, and was made available to Spotify’s Premium Family subscribers.
Spotify’s Premium Family plan costs $14.99 per month, and it can be accessed by six people in the same household. It offers ad-free music streaming, each with their own personalised accounts.
The Kids app can be customized by age range. Also, the content is hand-curated by Spotify editors, unlike YouTube kids app, which uses an algorithm to suggest content.

More children are using Facebook’s Messenger Kids app
The COVID-19 outbreak that pushed schools to shut has made Facebook’s Messenger Kids popular, according to a report by MIT Technology Review.
The app showed a noticeable increase in downloads as the coronavirus pandemic erupted, according to SensorTower.
Parents are allowing their kids to use the Messenger as it helps them to stay in touch with their friends. Also, it offers them a chance to get on with their own work while their kids engage with their friends.
The app was originally launched in 2017 to allow kids too young to join Facebook to use their parents’ account to chat with other kids.

YouTube Originals content to binge during the COVID-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/youtube-originals-films-and-web-series-to-binge-during-lockdown/article31215322.ece,"Lockdown has ushered in new ways to entertain oneself, digital or otherwise, and we have given you our fair share of listicles for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar but there’s a platform worth our attention, too: YouTube Originals.
That’s right, YouTube is not just for make-up tutorials, recaps of our favourite sports news of the quotidian lives of vloggers. YouTube Originals was officially launched on September 24, 2019, but way before then, there were already an impressive line-up on content, from the bone-chilling kind to the sort which make you chuckle a bit during these difficult times.
Majority of the content is available in 4K along with closed captioning as well as subtitles in French, Japanese and German, among other languages. However, some content is restricted to YouTube Premium users. Pre-paid and subscription plans are available, starting at ₹129 per month.
Here is our list of unmissable YouTube Originals:
Robert Downey Jr summons his inner-Tony Stark as he hosts this sci-tech show which addresses the ongoing convergence of futurism (in this case, Artificial Intelligence) and humanity. The show kicked off on December 18, 2019. It seems, though, that Downey Jr himself checks his Tony Stark ego at the door, given the very real and astounding advancements in the discussed fields. The series comprises impressive nuances in med-tech, an AI baby, and an ex-NFL star regaining his voice, making it appealing to those who consider themselves technophobes.
There are 8 episodes of ‘The Age Of A.I.’, each about half an hour long.
Bibliophiles, you haven’t been forgotten. BookTube isn’t just an informal name for the book-loving community on the platform anymore, it’s now a full-fledge show which made its foray into YouTube on March 19. The series features Michelle Obama, Margaret Atwood, Malcolm Gladwell, Jaqueline Woodson and Melinda Gates.
Expect discussions on not just the literary world but also social issues such as placement of the LGBTQ+ communities, racial disparity and family. The Michelle Obama episode extensively delves into the back-story of her memoir Becoming which she discusses intensively with author John Green.
There are 7 episodes of ‘BookTube’ , each around 15 minutes long.
The Canadian pop star has not had an easy life in the limelight; he struggled with mental health issues, personal relationships and a hectic schedule as a musician. Seasons, which launched on January 27, features never-before-seen footage of his music-making career, his quotidian life with wife Hailery Bieber (nee Baldwin), as well as confessionals with the 26-year-old sensation himself.
“My life is changing a lot,” Bieber says at one point of the series, adding, “Getting married, getting back in the studio, talking about getting married. Just being creative with being in this new chapter. And being happy about what I’m doing and being in a good space; a better headspace.”
There are 10 episodes of ‘Seasons’, each an average of 10 minutes long.
A Hajime production, The Fake Show is a satirical commentary on the often ill-perceived life of well-known YouTubers who are known to frequently glamourise their lifestyles. The plot follows Shotaro who strives to go above and beyond to make a name for himself in a fast-saturating YouTuber market. Unfortunately, chaos ensues when Shotaro’s doppelganger steals his account. Though the premise is straightforward, the humour and direction of the show is impressive, once again reminding us that Japanese entertainment is eons ahead of many of us.
The 11-episode show kicked off on December 12, 2018, before the genesis of YouTube Originals, but this has been added to the Originals collection.
Eminem and acclaimed music video director Joseph Kahn come together for this YouTube Original feature film. It follows Berkeley grad student Adam Merkin who gets sucked into the rap-battle game after meeting icon Behn Grym and accidentally competing in — and winning — his first battle. Do we expect a plot of any other kind from Eminem? Rising through the ranks of the battle scene with his provocative insults, Adam alienates his academic buddies, uptight girlfriend, and literary professor father.
The R-rated two-hour feature film launched on the platform on November 28.
Another dark horse in the YouTube Original realm is this Jordan Peele masterpiece. Weird City follows a halved society, segregated by economic class: Above The Line, populated by Haves, and Below The Line, populated by Have-Nots. We already know this is going to be a good watch.
The series stars Dylan O’Brien, Rosario Dawson, Michael Cera and LeVar Burton. Colourful production design and self-aware writing make for a rivetting watch.

The man from Kerala who cured yaws in the 1930s,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-man-from-kerala-who-cured-yaws-in-the-1930s/article31218417.ece,"
Two men were on a mission in a bullockcart. Covering the hilly terrain was not easy in the mid-1930s when roads were few. Moving from village to village and walking through paddy fields and slush in the rural area of Kadakkal, now in Kollam district, nearly 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, were Dr Sankaran Govindan and his compounder Padmanabhan Pillai. Over three years they injected more than 12,500 patients with medicine, to cure them of the tropical bacterial infection yaws that was mutilating and crippling people.
As doctors and health workers battle COVID-19 the world over, Dr G Krishnakumar rewinds to an era when his father worked hard to cure the people of Kadakkal from yaws, an infection affecting the skin, bones, and joints, that was endemic in the hilly areas of the princely state of esrtwhile Travancore, on India’s south-west coast.

Dr Govindan, then a young doctor in his thirties who’d graduated from Madras Medical College, took up his first posting as medical officer in 1935-36 at a government dispensary in Kadakkal. His father Shangu Vaidyan was the Kottaram Vaidyan (palace physician) and he sent his son for higher education to what was then Madras.
Allopathy was still an unknown system of treatment in rural Kadakkal, but the young doctor’s work, attitude, and sincerity gradually brought him patients. In the predominantly agrarian area, inhabited by marginal farmers and tribes people in the hills, Dr Govindan noticed a lesion that occurred in many people of different age groups, especially among those who lived in close quarters. He identified it as yaws that is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis, though it is not transmitted through sexual intercourse. It spreads through direct contact with infected wounds, instead. 
What causes YawsYaws is a disease caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, a bacteria closely related to Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis. The bacteria is transmitted by direct contact, acquired during childhood and can cause severe late manifestations years after initial infection.
“My father began documenting the illness and its treatment in an album-cum-journal that he meticulously maintained in 1936,” Dr Krishnakumar says, gently turning the pages of two albums, crumbling with age, and speaking of an era before the arrival of antibiotics, when doctors and compounders worked hand in hand to make medicines.
A jotting in the journal, supplemented with photographs, explains his findings and the progression of the disease. He noted that the primary lesion often occurs at the site of an existing ulcer or bruise, does not respond to any local treatment, and persists for years. Children were susceptible to yaws, perhaps because of their tender skin and poor health.

Dr Govindan found that healthy children with primary or secondary manifestations were able to withstand the disease but at any point of time when their immunity was compromised, they would fall prey to it. “The secondary manifestations sometimes appear after a period of years…. The ulcerating condition is more prolonged and extremely destructive. It makes the patient a cripple. …Bow legs are one of the characteristic features of Yaws,” he wrote.
In those days yaws was considered incurable. Dr Govindan found that Neo-Salvarsan, a drug made in Germany was found to be effective in curing the disease. But he understood that this would be too costly to treat a large group of people, especially those he treated, who were mostly underprivileged.







“That is when he read about an alternative treatment for yaws and found out that compounds of bismuth had been used in the treatment of syphilis since 1921. Immediately, he contacted his friend Narayanan Potti, then head of the department of chemistry at University College in the Thiruvananthapura,” says Dr Krishnakumar.
Professor Potti managed to synthesise and purify the sodium bismuth salt of tartaric acid for him in quantities sufficient for mass use. He called it Bisota. Dr Govindan and his assistants travelled from village to village injected one dose into each of those afflicted by yaws. As a result of their tireless work, yaws was eradicated from Kadakkal and the surrounding areas, says a historical article published in The Journal of the Association of Physicians India that Dr Krishnakumar wrote.

“My father had told me about this when I was a child. Now, these albums are all that remains of that momentous journey. Once the Trivandrum Medical College came up in Thiruvananthpuram, he was appointed in the department of surgery. After his retirement in 1962 as Professor of surgery in Kozhikode Medical College, he established Govidan’s Hospital in 1966,” says Krishnakumar.
He adds that as long as his father was practising, patients used to come from Kadakkal for treatment. Today, Kadakkal is a town and not many remember the work of its first doctor.",society
Covid-19: Chennai’s quilters now make protective masks ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/quilters-in-chennai-are-making-simple-cotton-masks-for-hospitals-patients-and-others-in-their-community/article31216331.ece,"The inchworms have swung into action. These members of The Square Inch (India’s first quilting studio, where they meet to exchange quilting designs and techniques and organise and execute community serving projects) are a community of 150 or so quilters in Chennai, explains Varsha Sundararajan. Now, in response to Covid-19, instead of quilts, they are making masks.
“We have a Facebook group of quilters of Indian origin across the world. One member is Jaya Parker, an ER surgeon in the US. Tina Katwal, the founder of the Square Inch, asked her what she thought of the idea of making masks in these times, and she said it was a good idea. Another quilter Elvira, from Guwahati, shared pictures of the masks she had already started making. We spoke to more doctors in the city and they were encouraging too,” says Varsha, who is particular to point out that these are not Covid-19-specific masks. “Masks are needed for other patients too. Those visiting hospitals for dialysis, pregnant women and others who are vulnerable to any infection.”
She says that Madras Medical Mission (MMM) approached them and the nephrologists suggested modifications, such as making a provision to insert a filter that would keep patients safe. The inchworms got to work and supplied them with 250 masks in three days. Dr Rajeevalochana P of MMM is happy with them but reiterates that the masks are not for those affected by Covid-19 or for health workers. “These are for patients vulnerable to infections, especially those who come twice or thrice a week for their dialysis. They have to wear masks when they are here. We will sterilise these masks and distribute it to them. These masks can be washed and reused and therefore are most useful,” she says. The quilters have also supplied masks to a maternity hospital.

Apart from hospitals, the inchworms are also focussing on making and distributing masks in their respective localities, gated communities and apartments. “There are so many senior citizens and their caregivers where I live. I made masks for them too. And for the milkman, the paper delivery person and the sanitation workers who turn up every day to clean the streets,” says Varsha. Once the needs of each quilter’s community is met, surplus masks are collected at five or six points in the city to be distributed elsewhere. One of the quilters made a mask for her watchman and a policeman who saw him asked where he had got the mask from. She gave him one too! Each mask they give out is accompanied with instructions on how it is to be used. The instructions come in Tamil, English and Hindi.
Tailoring the mask is simple, assures Varsha. “There are just a few points we have to keep in mind and we are good to go.” The masks are made of 100% cotton fabric. Where is all the fabric coming from? Varsha laughs. “All quilters worth their quilts squirrel away fabric. We call it our stash. I never thought I would run out of my stash ever, but I am!”
The inchworms have shared what they do on social media and with friends and family. “We may not be able to cater to demands for masks from elsewhere. But we will be more than happy to share how the masks are made,” says Varsha. She says she has had enquiries from as far as Nepal and, closer home, from Coimbatore. “I ask them to identify two or three tailors with sewing machines and we can tell them how to make the masks over Skype or WhatsApp.” Varsha adds that the quilters have also taught the teachers of V-Excel Educational Trust, and they, in turn, will be teaching others through video.
Admittedly, the inchworms and their masks have come in for considerable flak from “a legion of naysayers.” “But we have stood our ground. Doctors have approved it, hospitals are using it and our sanitation workers and those who are providing essential services are grateful for them. Fabric masks do have their uses. It is a barrier of sorts and the first line of defence. They are easy to make, are not patented and we are happy to show you how to make them.”

Construction halt to hit L&T revenue,https://www.thehindu.com/business/construction-halt-to-hit-lt-revenue/article31221912.ece,"The COVID-19 lockdown in India has brought construction activities to a halt in the peak season, a move that will hurt revenues of engineering and construction major Larsen and Toubro (L&T), according to analysts.
“We note that March is a peak month for construction activities in India. Even post the lockdown, there might be some more delays in resuming construction activities in full swing as labour, machinery and materials would need to be re-mobilised. Thus, we see a clear risk to our revenue growth assumptions for the fourth quarter of FY20 as well as FY21 estimates,” Motilal Oswal said in a research note to its clients.
The brokerage has cut FY21 and FY22 earnings by 20% and 14% respectively and the target price to ₹1,320 crore.
Historically, the month of March is marked by higher execution and payments from government authorities, which brings down the closing working capital for the year. However, the fourth quarter of FY20 will not see execution as well as payment push.
Moreover, L&T would have to continue supporting its vendor base, including sub-contractors, in these tough times, as it has been doing over the past many months. This is likely to increase its working capital further.
Besides, the oil price crash is likely to weaken the prospects of the hydrocarbon segment in the near term, according to analysts.
The hydrocarbon segment has been a key driver of execution and earnings since the last 4 years for L&T with the highest ever order book and double digit margins. ",business

Gains in the benchmarks were primarily led by stocks like ITC, Tech Mahindra, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints, Nestle HDFC and State Bank of India among others.
“The index managed to show some pullback move today owing to buying seen in the defensive sectors such as FMCG, Pharma and IT,” said Ruchit Jain, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel Broking.
“The banking space also witnessed some pullback but it continued to be a relative under performer compared to some of the other indices. One positive development that was seen was the decline in the India VIX,” added Mr. Jain.

“The [moratorium] scheme will be uniformly applicable to all standard term loans under housing loans, loans against property, auto loans, education loans and personal loans as of March 1. There is no separate request required from the borrower,” it said. 
IDBI Bank has said that in case the March 2020 instalment had already paid by the borrower, the relief would be applicable for the EMIs payable in April 2020 and May 2020.
On the other hand, private sector lender IDFC First Bank has said that customers who want to avail the moratorium have to inform the bank from his/her registered email at help@idfcfirstbank.com with mobile number and loan account number. 
Housing finance company Indiabulls HFC has asked its customers to fill up a form available on its website to avail the moratorium. 
On Friday , the RBI had allowed all banks and financial institutions including non-banking financial companies, to extend a three-month moratorium period on EMIs falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 for all term loans. 
This is also applicable to auto, home and personal loans as well as credit card outstanding. This would mean a consumer may choose not to pay monthly equated instalments on their loans for the next three months.

The country’s office sector likely to see lower gross absorption of about 45-50 million sq ft in 2020 due to delays in decision-making, arising from the ongoing pandemic outbreak, it further said.
“We recommend investors to capitalise on the situation and focus on commercial real estate assets as their cap rates are likely to decline in line with the falling 10-year government bond yields. This should place commercial assets in a more lucrative position, possibly generating higher returns for investors. We also recommend investors to scout for assets in data centres and warehousing and logistics, given strong potential in terms of cloud infrastructure, and robust domestic demand”, said Sankey Prasad, Managing Director and Chairman at Colliers International India.
Colliers study spotted a strong inclination for ‘remote working’ and ‘building data capabilities’ among occupiers. MNCs are likely re-evaluate their workplace strategies with respect to global in-house centres/support centres and call centres in India to minimise continuity risk.
“The current scenario may be a precursor to a shift in the idea of workplaces and hence we recommend that occupiers evaluate their density plan and seating arrangements in workplaces, keeping safety and health as key considerations,’’ said Colliers study.
Currently, each employee/seat, on an average, takes 60-80 sq feet at workspace, as against 100 sq.ft and above internationally.
During H1 2020, the realty advisory anticipated slower deployment of funds in India by foreign investors as they are on a wait-and-see mode. “We foresee occupancy levels in flexible workspaces to stay muted in March and April as the risk exposure is higher than in traditional offices,’’ the study cautioned.",business

This will also result in a lower CASA ratio, but reduce our dependency on this category for deposits in future.”
The bank has also said there was some reduction in wholesale deposits, which could possibly be because of the fall in stock price.

ITC’s perfume unit will now make Savlon hand sanitisers,https://www.thehindu.com/business/itcs-perfume-unit-will-now-make-savlon-hand-sanitisers/article31218034.ece," Retail conglomerate ITC has repurposed its perfume manufacturing facility in Himachal Pradesh to produce an additional 1,25,000 litres of Savlon hand sanitisers, amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis and an unprecedented surge in demand for hand-hygiene products like sanitisers.
To serve a larger national priority during these challenging times, ITC’s Perfume manufacturing facility in Himachal Pradesh has commenced production of Savlon sanitisers to cater to the soaring demand due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a release.
Sameer Satpathy, Chief Executive, Personal Care Products, ITC Ltd., said, “Addressing a larger national requirement during the Coronavirus pandemic, ITC has repurposed its recently commissioned perfume manufacturing facility in Manpura, Himachal Pradesh to manufacture Savlon Hand Sanitizers. 
“This initiative reinforces our efforts to enable enhanced production and supply of Savlon range of hygiene products in the market which is the need of the hour to help fight the virus and contain its spread.”
In line with the government order and in public interest, ITC has reduced prices of Savlon sanitisers and was working overnight to reach the new stocks with the revised prices to the market. The company has also reinforced its efforts to enhance awareness about the importance of hand hygiene through campaigns across digital, print and other communication platforms, said the company.
It was in November 2019 that ITC set up this plant to manufacture premium fragrances.",business
Coronavirus | World Bank says about 11 million could be driven into poverty in East Asia and Pacific,https://www.thehindu.com/business/coronavirus-world-bank-says-about-11-million-could-be-driven-into-poverty-in-east-asia-and-pacific/article31215126.ece," About 11 million people could be driven into poverty in East Asia and the Pacific as a result of the coronavirus pandemic that has impacted over 780,000 people and killed more than 37,000 globally, the World Bank has warned.
 The Washington-based global lender, in a report released on Monday, said that prior projections had estimated that nearly 35 million people would escape poverty in East Asia and the Pacific in 2020, including over 25 million in China alone.
“If the economic situation were to deteriorate further, and the lower-case scenario prevails, then poverty is estimated to increase by about 11 million people,” it said in its April 2020 Economic Update for East Asia and the Pacific ahead of the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 Growth in the developing East Asia and Pacific, the bank said, is projected to slow to 2.1% in the baseline and to negative 0.5% in the lower-case scenario in 2020, from an estimated 5.8% in 2019.

 Growth in China is projected to decline to 2.3% in the baseline and 0.1% in the lower-case scenario in 2020, from 6.1% in 2019.
 Containment of the pandemic would allow for a sustained recovery in the region, although risks to the outlook from financial market stress would remain high, the report said.

 Noting that the COVID-19 shock will have a serious impact on poverty, the bank said the report estimates that under the baseline growth scenario, nearly 24 million fewer people will escape poverty across the region in 2020 than would have in the absence of the pandemic (using a poverty line of $5.50/day).
 Countries in East Asia and the Pacific that were already coping with international trade tensions and the repercussions of the spread of COVID-19 in China are now faced with a global shock, said Victoria Kwakwa, Vice President for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.
“The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined,” she said.
 Among the actions recommended by the report are urgent investments in national healthcare capacity and longer-term preparedness.
 It also suggests taking an integrated view of containment and macroeconomic policies. Targeted fiscal measures - such as subsidies for sick pay and healthcare - would help with containment and ensure that temporary deprivation does not translate into long-term losses of human capital.
“In addition to bold national actions, deeper international cooperation is the most effective vaccine against this virulent threat. Countries in East Asia and the Pacific and elsewhere must fight this disease together, keep trade open and coordinate macroeconomic policy,” said Aaditya Mattoo, Chief Economist for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.
 The report said that the worsening in the COVID-19 pandemic and/or more severe/prolonged travel restrictions would have further negative impacts on tourism activity. ",business

 Mallya, who is wanted in India on alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to an estimated ₹9,000 crore, also said all his companies have effectively ceased operations and manufacturing following the lockdown in India.
“I have made repeated offers to pay 100 per cent of the amount borrowed by KFA to the Banks. Neither are Banks willing to take money and neither is the ED willing to release their attachments which they did at the behest of the Banks. I wish the FM would listen in this time of crisis,” Mallya said in a series of tweets.
 He further said, “Indian Government has done what was unthinkable in locking down the entire country. We respect that. All my companies have effectively ceased operations. All manufacturing is closed as well.”

The Dharamshala International Film Festival comes home to viewers,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-dharamshala-international-film-festival-comes-home-to-viewers/article31219301.ece,"“Bringing independent cinema to the mountains,” has been the catchline of the Dharamshala International Film Festival (DIFF). Now it’s unspooling the indies on a computer, laptop, mobile or tablet near you. In a unique attempt in the Indian film festival circuit, DIFF set up an online Viewing Room on its website on Tuesday where it will be streaming its alumni films, free of cost to viewers across the world. 
DIFF will be showcasing a set of four to six films every couple of weeks.
The idea of sharing the films that the festival has showcased over the years took root ten days back. “Seeing the situation, the fact that everyone is at home, we thought of doing something positive,” says festival director and filmmaker Ritu Sarin. They reached out to the alumni filmmakers and were overwhelmed by the tremendous response they got in return.
“With COVID-19 reshaping the world, we have been thinking about how to reach out [to the DIFF regulars and patrons] and at the moment the filmmakers also don’t know what the future holds for them,” says Ms Sarin. The idea then, for all, has been to keep up the spirits and seek inspiration in these uncertain times in cinema itself.
The entire venture is being run on the goodwill between the filmmakers and the festival. “DIFF is run by a no profits trust. It’s [Viewing Room] in keeping with the spirit of the festival,” says Ms Sarin.
The programming too reflects the festival’s thrust: political and socially conscious cinema. At a time when online content consumption is rising exponentially, DIFF is not offering the regular popular stuff but a carefully curated list of rare, alternate films with artistic merit, underlined with a humane touch and reflecting the political realities of our times. When we are being forced to shut out the world, these films open a small window to it; when individuals and their respective countries are on a lock down mode, they offer a fantastic, expansive political and cultural peep into our uncomfortable realities, COVID or no COVID.
Sean McAllister’s A Syrian Love Story (2015) is a heartbreaking documentary that dwells on the human toll in the Middle Eastern conflict, through its focus on five years of the life of a couple that first fell in love in a Syrian prison and fled to France via Lebanon to seek political asylum. But could they truly abandon the home called Syria? Naeem Mohaiemen’s experimental film Tripoli Cancelled (2017) looks at the unsettling feeling between being at home and in asylum through a week in the life of a man stranded in an abandoned airport. Jeon Soo-Il’s A Korean in Paris (2015) is about a man cast away in the French capital in search of his wife who suddenly goes missing on their honeymoon. Prasanna Vithanage’s With You Without You (2013) juxtaposes the healing power of love against the personal traumas and political strife in the wake of the Civil War in Sri Lanka.
Coming up in the weeks ahead: Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi's 5 Broken Cameras, Abhay Kumar's Placebo (2014), Andrew Hinton and Johnny Burke's Tashi and the Monk (2014) and Ritu Sarin and Tanzing Sonam's When Hari Got Married (2013).
Meanwhile, Jio Mami Mumbai Film Festival With Star, even as it opened for entries for its next edition in November, has begun sharing a comprehensive list of films across 21 years that have screened at the festival and in their year round programme, also pointing out the streaming platforms where these titles can be accessed. The festival came up with the first list of international and Indian (both features and shorts) for the year 2019 on Sunday.
New York Indian Film Festival might have been postponed for the while but, to stay in touch with its members and supporters, festival director Aseem Chhabra has begun recommending one film or show a week — kicking off with Aijaz Khan’s Hamid — that is available on streaming platforms in the US.

Easter egg symbolism to behind-the-scenes stories: What are Kollywood directors up to?,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/what-are-directors-upto/article31218247.ece,"Director Venkat Prabhu’s Mankatha had a rippling effect on Tamil filmdom, in the way characters were written for mass heroes. The film, starring Ajith Kumar in the lead, opened to rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, primarily appreciating for its unadulterated portrayal of the anti-hero. Apart from the innumerable references to “Thala”, Mankatha was more popularly known as the movie for which Ajith Kumar prepared biryani for the entire cast and crew. Sharing that ‘biryani’ incident on Twitter, Venkat Prabhu dug up his old tweet which he posted during the making of Mankatha. In the tweet, he wrote, “We shot the interval block today. So when you see it in the theater, remember this was the scene where Thala cooked biryani for us.”

Talks about Mankatha 2 have been on and off and nothing has yet been finalised. Like the character who goes to enquire about Vinayak Mahadev in the climax, we are also waiting with bated breath.
A movie about impotency isn’t a subject material that you would normally expect from a debut filmmaker. But that was the catch for RS Prasanna, who made the warm and fuzzy romantic-comedy Kalyana Samayal Saadham (2013) starring his namesake actor Prasanna and Lekha Washington. One of the major highlights of the film was the way Prasanna captured the intimacy between the couple in the song ‘Mella Sirithal’, which became an instant earworm. Giving the audience a glimpse into what went into the making of the song, Prasanna posted a screenshot from the screenplay of Kalyana Samayal Saadham. He said, “The description of the script of Kalyana Samayal Saadham that became ""Mella Sirithai"" the FB song that went viral and helped us reach the audience.”

Prasanna has been using the quarantine time effectively on Twitter, sharing notes and recommending books for budding filmmakers. It must be noted that Kalyana Samayal Saadham was remade in Hindi as Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan with Ayushmann Khuranna and Bhumi Pednekar in titular roles. 
The youngest among the lot, Karthick Naren, chose to do something different. In a series of tweets, Karthick began to ‘decode’ his second directorial, Mafia: Chapter 1, for the benefit of the audience who otherwise felt disappointed with the end product. “Would like to share few hidden details, easter eggs and homages that may have gone unnoticed,” he posted on the micro-blogging platform.

Kanika is presently admitted to the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS).
Director of the institute, Prof. R. K. Dhiman said that the singer’s condition was stable and there was no cause for worry.
Kapoor has tested positive for coronavirus for the fifth consecutive time.
Kapoor has been in hospital for over a fortnight. On March 20, she herself announced on Instagram that she had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Her announcement caused a major scare in the country as she had been to parties attended by several bigwigs.
The singer, who had returned from the UK, forced the political elite like former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and her son Dushyant Singh into quarantine. This was followed by the chain effect forcing other leaders like Derek O’ Brien, Anupriya Patel, Sanjay Singh and many others to go into self-isolation.
Kapoor has faced flak for not revealing her travel history and not going into self-isolation soon after arriving from London. The Uttar Pradesh government has also filed a case against her.
It all started when former BSP MP Akbar Ahmed Dumpy threw a birthday party on March 14, which was attended by many socialites and royals. In the list, were Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh, Congress leader Jitin Prasada, Rajasthan’s former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia and her MP son Dushyant Singh among others.

Coronavirus effect on Tamil film industry’s daily wagers: Is there light at the end of the tunnel?,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-effect-on-tamil-film-industrys-daily-wagers-is-there-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/article31216364.ece,"A text message from a light man to RK Selvamani, president of Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI), was what alerted the Tamil film industry to a crisis brewing in its background.
Even prior to the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, film industries across the country had been advised to stop production in light of the Coronavirus outbreak. The future of several thousand workers (a majority of whom are daily wagers), that the film industry employs, rendered jobless at least until April 15, is now up in the air, and FEFSI, as the umbrella organisation representing the 23 crafts unions these workers belong to, has its task cut out.
A member of the production boys union, M Vallarasu, whose job it is to provide catering support to people working on a film set, says that the 21-day lockdown is “indigestible” for daily wagers like him. “To compensate for the shortfall in wages accrued over this period, I will need to work without a break for the next three or four months, if shooting resumes that is,” he adds.

The question of when a shoot will resume is tricky; the end of the lockdown period does not mean that a film crew will pick up from where they dropped off: logistics, for example, will be a nightmare. And if you happen to work in a film like the Silambarasan-starrer Maanaadu (infamous for its many stop-starts), like Vallarasu was, then the prospect of having to remain out of work for much longer becomes a reality, and it is not a particularly pleasant economic situation to find oneself in.
“I will have to borrow from someone, but the problem is that nobody is willing to lend in this situation. I have asked. They tell me to come back when work has resumed. I’m thinking of pawning my wife’s jewels, but if I step out, I have to be wary of the police seizing my vehicle,” says Vallarasu, who lives in rented accommodation in Ramapuram with his wife and two daughters.
Of immediate concern for K Venugopal, a member of the technicians’ union and a daily wager since 1992, is the internal squabble within FEFSI that has resulted in a bit of ostracism from the umbrella agency.

Venugopal, whose job it is to handle the audio recorder on a film set — rewinding and forwarding the tape endlessly as the choreographer demands retakes-upon-retakes — does not want to come clear on the issue that caused the resentment, but is “hopeful” that an extraordinary situation like the Coronavirus pandemic will push people to think of everyone’s welfare.
“The actors have been giving money and rice bags. There is no announcement yet though from FEFSI on when it will be distributed to us. How to pay my rent for the next month is what I’m thinking about,” says Venugopal, who earns about ₹1,350-1,400 per day for his work.
The worst affected, according to a few in the film industry, are the assistant directors.






Actor Soundar

Says Soundararajan aka Soundar, a prominent junior artiste, member of the directors’ union and an associate of filmmaker P Vasu, “The supporting artistes also have it cut out. Most of them get paid between ₹300-500 to be part of a scene.” He adds: “Most assistant directors have little in terms of savings to their name. Say, if you are an assistant to Atlee, and he makes a film with Vijay, you would have been paid well, but even then you will run through your earnings when Atlee doesn’t make a film. Now, imagine this situation for the assistants of lower profile filmmakers.”
Actors like Rajinikanth (₹50 lakh), the Suriya Sivakumar family, Vijay Sethupathi and Sivakarthikeyan (₹10 lakh), producer Kalaipuli S Thanu (250 bags of 25kg rice) and actor Yogi Babu (50 bags of 25kg rice) among others have made a few contributions. A similar situation in Bollywood, reportedly, attracted the intervention of actor Salman Khan, according to BN Tiwari, head of Federation of Western India Cine Employees, the FEFSI equivalent in Mumbai.
If this was the case with the big screen, then small screen technicians, by the looks of it, are in an even more precarious situation. SJ Edward Raj, who prefers to be quoted as Thalapathy, the president of Federation of Small Screen Technicians (FESST), says that the small screen employs “more number of technicians” than the film industry at the moment. His assessment is on the back of the number of active technicians on the field.

“At least 50 television serials are shot in various parts of the city on a daily basis. Let’s assume at least 50 technicians are on hand in all of these locations. Most of them are daily wagers,” he says. Thalapathy adds that he has reached out to small screen’s bigwigs and wealthy production houses for support, but his efforts are curtailed by the fact that unionisation of technicians is not as effective as in the film industry. “The upkeep of the union itself is a big struggle for us in the small screen. In FEFSI, the respective crafts union will demand that members give five to 10% of their earnings back to the union. What we do is to mediate in case of payment dispute or help our members’ kids to get a school or college seat. Beyond that, we don’t have the means,” he says.
Whatever funds flows into FEFSI, Selvamani will have a tough time splitting the share. The official member count of FEFSI is around 25,000. Some union members, however, insist that the membership is much higher.

Says B Sridhar, a background dancer, whose union has around 850-odd members, that it is because most members are inactive, or have already sought out alternate employment because the film industry cannot be trusted to provide regular employment. “In the case of background dancers, only those with height, personality and glamour will be chosen to dance alongside the hero. Otherwise, the production won’t call. The ones who get no work naturally gravitate towards other employment. I know people who drive Uber cars for a living. The problem is even these alternate forms of livelihood have now been affected,” he says.
Which leads to the distinct possibility of many inactive members turning towards FEFSI for monetary support. Selvamani, for his part, and other FEFSI office-bearers, are dependent on the generosity of the bigger names in Tamil cinema to keep the contribution channels open to help battle the crisis.",movies

New April releases on Netflix: ‘Money Heist’ season 4, Chris Hemsworth’s ‘Extraction’, and more

Now, a new free tool for Google Chrome called Netflix Party makes this lockdown a whole lot bearable: it lets you start, pause and stop a show, movie or anime you watch on the platform at the same time as a group of people. You don’t have to be constantly Whatsapping people to find out which point in the episode they are on, or coordinate bathroom breaks. There’s even a chat window on the side where you can discuss plot points and moments that are going on, exactly like you would if you were next to each other. 







It’s simple enough to use, and the only caveat is that everyone watching needs to have a Netflix account. The platform is offering a 3-day free trial for new subscribers, even for those who don’t.
Downloading and using Netflix Party is quite straightforward: After logging into you Netflix account, visit the www.netflixparty.com website, and download the Google Chrome extension. A grey NP icon will be visible now in the browser toolbar.
Next, after you find a show or movie that everyone wants to watch, click and open the stream.
The NP (Netflix Party) icon would have changed from gray to red. Click the icon and select Start the party. You are the host, so you can either decide to be the only controller pausing and playing the show, or the other option is to let anyone in the group take control. 
Now, copy the URL from the pop-up box and send it to everyone you want to invite to the party. The chatroom appears on the right side of the screen, where everyone joining the party will be visible and give in their comments. What next? Netflix and chill... from a safe, socially-acceptable distance.",movies

“We’ll cook it together and eat it together. And we will discuss lots of things — isolation and fear and also funny videos. And, you know, the fact that I can’t really cook. So it’s going to be fun,” the 33-year-old said in the clip.
Clarke has set the donation amount to 250,000 pounds.
The drive is in partnership with the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Massachusetts and the University College London Hospital.
“We are creating a virtual rehabilitation clinic so brain injury survivors have somewhere to go and somewhere to feel safe and somewhere to not feel so alone and isolated, which I think is a good thing. We need to do all we can to release as many beds as possible to free up our hardworking NHS,” Clarke said.

"The Telugu short film ‘Manasanamaha’, unveiled during lockdown, wins appreciation",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/telugu-short-film-manasanamaha-unveiled-during-lockdown-wins-appreciation/article31214919.ece," A new Telugu short film titled Manasanamaha (streaming on Kala Mediaworks channel on YouTube) has been winning hearts. Written and directed by aspiring feature filmmaker Deepak Reddy, the short that’s a little over 16 minutes has a youngster musing on the nature of love and recounting experiences from three past relationships.
Manasanamaha is a relationship drama, narrated for the most part in reverse. 
Deepak hadn’t planned to unveil the short film during lockdown. He had completed it around six months ago, shown it to a few leading producers in the Telugu film industry and wants to make it a full-length feature film. 
Earlier, a prospective producer had even advised him against uploading the short film digitally, since the story idea will be revealed. While the feature film plans are still on, the Coronavirus outbreak and the ensuing lockdown made Deepak consider uploading Manasanamaha on YouTube for everyone to see. “The feature film script is different, and the production scale is larger, so we went ahead with the digital release,” says Deepak.
Manasanamaha was written in 2018 and filmed within six days; the crew are all Deepak’s colleagues at Kala Media. The firm was established in 2014 by Deepak and his business partner Harinath Gungamari and specialises in wedding photography, corporate and ad films. From time to time, they make short films. Manasanamaha is Deepak’s fourth short film. 
The short stars Viraj Ashwin, Drishika Chander, Srivalli Raghvender, Prithvi Sharma and Bunny Abhiran. Produced by Shilpa Gajjala, the short has music by Kamran and playback singer Yazin Nizar has sung a song. The narrative stands out for its technical finesse; the sound design and mixing was executed by Sachin Sudhakaran of Sync Cinema, who has worked on much appreciated films like D-16 (Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru in Tamil). 
Edurolu Raju’s cinematography captures the transition from one frame to another as the story progresses through several long takes. Sometimes it’s a leaf, a glass of water or a mug of beer that transits from one frame to another, connecting the sequences. “Most of the editing was planned at the scripting stage,” says Deepak.

Since the story is narrated backwards, from the break-up to the first meeting, and all the actions happen in reverse, pre-visualisation was crucial. Deepak’s team designed 2D animated storyboards so that the crew had no ambiguity in what to execute.
Scratch the surface of what appears like a simple rom-com and Deepak presents the protagonist Surya as a metaphor to the sun, romancing women who represent different seasons — Chaitra (spring), Varsha (monsoon) and Sita (winter). He equates it to “the sun going through different seasons”. Since the story unfolds from Surya’s point of view and in reality, thought processes can be random, the first few minutes offer glimpses into Surya’s observations and thoughts. Eventually, Deepak had to bring in a structure to narrate the story.
Deepak is an engineer who got drawn towards cinema. After his engineering graduation in Kurnool, he briefly worked with an IT firm. He then enrolled in a film school in Hyderabad but eventually dropped out, not wanting to be bound by film theories. “I wanted to know the rules of filmmaking only to break them,” he says.
Before Tharun Bhascker’s Pellichoopulu (2016), Deepak remembers that it wasn’t easy for outsiders to break into the Telugu film industry and pitch stories to producers. His family, too, wanted him to be financially secure. That’s how he and Harikanth had started Kala Media. 
In the meantime, Deepak also did a masters programme in the US. Not wanting to be disconnected with cinema, in 2016 he made the short film Hide and Seek, which won him appreciation in Telugu film circles. 
The love for cinema was further fuelled when he was asked if he could assist and coordinate things on the sets of Sekhar Kammula’s Fidaa, when the crew was filming in the US. “That’s when I decided I had to make films. I convinced my mother and returned to India in mid 2017,” says Deepak.
Once in India, he felt he needed to understand the business dynamics of the film industry before he turned director, and started Weekend Cinema, a marketing and distribution company and has so far distributed 14 films. 
The next step is to make his directorial debut through a feature film.",movies
"U.S. crude off lows as Trump, Putin agree for energy talks",https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/us-crude-off-lows-as-trump-putin-agree-for-energy-talks/article31221881.ece," Oil prices steadied on Tuesday with the U.S. crude benchmark climbing off 18-year lows after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to talks on stabilising energy markets. 
However, the gains were capped as global demand continues to be slammed by travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 May Brent crude futures was 4 cents lower at $22.72 a barrel by 8.35 p.m. ISTafter closing on Monday at $22.76, its lowest finish since November 2002. 
It hit a session-high of $23.87. The more-active June contract traded 18 cents lower at $26.24 a barrel. U.S. crude was up 55 cents at $20.64 after settling in the previous session at $20.09, its lowest since February 2002. It traded as high as $21.89 a barrel earlier in the session.
Oil markets have faced a double whammy from the COVID-19 outbreak and a race to win market share between Saudi Arabia and Russia after OPEC and other producers failed this month to agree on deeper supply cuts to support oil prices.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin agreed in a phone call to have their top energy officials discuss stabilising oil markets, the Kremlin said.
Although the futures market is seeing a recovery, physical cargoes are selling in some regions at single digits, with sellers offering hefty discounts. With a plunge in prices that has knocked about 60% off oil prices this year, a commissioner with the Texas State energy regulator renewed a call for restrictions on crude production because of a national supply glut.
However, U.S. crude producers are likely facing cuts in April anyway as there are no buyers in physical markets for crude in the Permian, the biggest shale basin the country, or the U.S. Gulf Coast, said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at United ICAP.
“It's just a matter of time before we see the producers be forced by the crude gatherers to cut as one cannot 'gather' crude when there are no buyers or tanks to store it in,” he said.
In a sign of how well the market is supplied, the front-month Brent futures contract for May is trading at a discount of $13.95 a barrel to the November contract, the widest contango spread ever seen, ahead of the May contract's expiry.
A contango market implies traders expect oil to be higher in the future, encouraging them to store oil now to sell later.
Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plans to boost its oil exports to 10.6 million barrels per day (bpd) from May on lower domestic consumption, a Saudi Energy Ministry official said.
Global oil refiners, meanwhile, have cut their throughput because of the slump in demand for transportation fuel, with European refineries reducing output by at least 1.3 million bpd, sources told Reuters.
Exxon Mobil Corp closed a small crude distillation unit at its 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana because of low demand, sources said.
The chief economist for global commodities trader Trafigura said that oil demand could fall in the coming weeks by as much as 30% from consumption at the end of last year.
A Reuters survey of 40 analysts forecast Brent crude prices would average $38.76 a barrel in 2020, 36% lower than the $60.63 forecast in a February survey.",markets

"Staying on top of things, the Gopi way",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/staying-on-top-of-things-the-gopi-way/article31230305.ece,"P. Gopi Chand, India’s chief National coach, has worked hard to contribute to the badminton world.
Even as most of the athletes are struggling to find ways to stay fit during the current lockdown, Gopi is on top of his game, using the Zoom App to ensure that the majority of trainees of the Gopi Academy are linked to and participate in the live, video fitness sessions.
“We have to think of ways to stay fit, which is a pre-requisite to being back on the badminton court. So, I thought the best way is to ensure that most of trainees have some physical conditioning to be game-fit once the lockdown is lifted,” Gopi said in an exclusive chat with The Hindu on Wednesday.
“These sessions are conducted twice a day via the Zoom app, which facilitates [fitness expert] Dinaz Vervatwala to demonstrate and monitor how the players are doing the exercises.
“It is a mix of traditional and scientific methods — the exercises include breathing, meditation, 15 minutes of skipping, [variations of the] Surya Namaskar, and alternate toe-touches. Besides this, I am also keen to see them stay in touch with the sport by opting for shadow and wall practice,” he said.
These innovative ‘circuit work-out’ sessions online are not just confined to those in and around Hyderabad, but also to those who have left the Academy to be at their respective homes in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.
While Vervatwala regularly appeals to the players to be honest to themselves in doing the exercises, Gopi focuses on the shadow practice of smashes or returns — of five sets each for 40 seconds each, followed by 20-30 seconds of rest, and a second set with emphasis on parallel strokes.
Will there be a critical review? “I will definitely check the fitness levels of most of them once they are back in the Academy and take remedial measures, if necessary,” said Gopi.
Many like B. Sai Praneeth welcome this. “It is wonderful to have these sessions, as something is always better than doing nothing,” he said.

I am confident of the car: Daruvala,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/i-am-confident-of-the-car-daruvala/article31230253.ece,"India’s Jehan Daruvala took a decisive step in his career progression to Formula One after signing as a Red Bull junior driver ahead of his F2 debut this year.
Red Bull, which has two teams in F1 — Red Bull Racing and Alpha Tauri — has one of the best junior programmes in F1 with the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen coming through it.
Ahead of the season, Daruvala drove the F2 car in the pre-season testing held at Bahrain early in March, and topped the timesheets in two of the six sessions — the only driver to do so multiple times.
However, with the season in limbo, the Indian is back home in Mumbai, spending some quality time with his family; something he doesn’t get to do often, as he has been based out of the UK since his karting days.
Speaking to The Hindu about his impressive testing performance, Daruvala said, “It was my first time in the F2 car and I felt good. I was coming back from knee surgery, and so the first day was about trying to get back into the groove. 
“I adapted well to the car and felt quite comfortable rightaway.
“While it is difficult to know where we stand based on just one-lap pace, we were quite fast on the long runs. I am quietly confident that we have a good car,” added Daruvala.
Despite the break, he is leaving no stone unturned to be in shape and is ready if and when the season starts. 
“I am just going to train as I usually do. I also have a new simulator that I have set up at home, though there are some connectivity issues. I hope I can fix them once the lockdown ends.” 
The simulator is a very important tool for drivers to be fully prepared before going into a race weekend.
With the current situation not expected to ease until June or July in the continent, F2 faces a tough road ahead. 
When asked if there are concerns that the season could be massively curtailed or even cancelled, he said, “It is unfortunate not to be racing and we have no idea what is going to happen. 
“So, I just hope to be as prepared as possible when it starts.”",other sports
It’s a ‘welcome break’ for tired Prannoy,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/its-a-welcome-break-for-tired-prannoy/article31228635.ece,"For H.S. Prannoy, the COVID-19-enforced break has been a blessing in disguise.
The 27-year-old former World No. 8 Prannoy said he was using the layoff to rest his tired body and rediscover his lost mojo.
“The month-long break is the biggest I have got in my professional career. I have never stayed at home for more than a week in the last seven years and I am enjoying every minute of it. In a way, it is a welcome break and good for me to recharge my batteries and come back refreshed for the new season,” he said.
Prannoy, who skipped the All England Open badminton championship, said it was a right decision in the prevailing circumstances and said he was worried about the slump in his ranking due to the snapping of the international schedule. [The BWF has since freezed the rankings as of March 17].
“The tournament was taking place at a time when the disease was spreading rapidly in England and I thought it was risky,” he said.
Prannoy, whose form has taken a dip in the last one and a half years (from eight to 28), said he was using the break to reflect on what went wrong with his game. “I must confess that I am not anywhere as consistent now as I was two years ago. A lot of things have contributed to it. I was not happy with the way I was training, as I struggled with the methods of the new coach at the academy. I wasn’t getting any match practice and there wasn’t any time to reflect on my game as I was playing non-stop. Now that I have got a break, I can rework my game.”

 There was a clamour for freezing the world rankings with Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal, B. Sai Praneeth, Parupalli Kashyap and H.S. Prannoy leading the way in expressing their concerns.
 “The Badminton World Federation (BWF) can announce it will freeze World Rankings and World Junior Rankings until further notice. The freezing of rankings will be backdated to Week 12, which is the week following the last international tournament that was played — the YONEX All England Open 2020,” BWF said in a release.
 “The ranking lists issued on 17 March, 2020 will serve as a basis for entry and seeding into the next international tournaments — although it is difficult to say at this stage when this may be.”

 Shuttlers in the singles competition have to be inside top-16 of world rankings to qualify for the Olympics. The cut-off for doubles is also top-16.
 The BWF had suspended all tournaments post the All England Championships until April 12 due to the pandemic.
 These tournaments include big-ticket events like India Open (Super 500), Malaysia Open (Super 750) and Singapore Open (Super 500), apart from the three Continental Confederation championships.
 BWF said due to the current scenario the next set of tournaments will also be suspended.
 “Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the badminton community has experienced an unprecedented suspension to international tournaments from mid-march 2020 to the end of April 2020.
 “At present, it is difficult to predict when the next international tournament will take place with further tournaments also expected to be suspended in May and June.” 
The world body said it will take time to decide on the process of unfreezing the world rankings as it will depend on how the international calender looks once things improve.
 “BWF will provide more information in due course regarding the process as to how the rankings will eventually be ‘unfrozen’ following the commencement of the international circuit,” BWF said.
 “However, it is difficult to outline the exact procedure until we have an exact overview of what the international calendar will look like once play resumes and suspended tournaments have been rescheduled.
 “We are seeking to define a solution to unfreeze the rankings in a staggered way to avoid any extreme drop off of points from previous tournaments causing an extreme impact on the ranking structure.” 
Many international stars, including Saina and Kashyap, had suggested that the qualification period for the Tokyo Olympics be extended in light of tournaments getting cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 The governing body said it will start reviewing the Olympic qualification system but a decision will take several weeks.
 “Following yesterday’s announcement to reschedule the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from July 23 to August 8 2021, BWF will now also initiate a review process to confirm any impact on the Olympic qualification system,” BWF said.

"Today’s cache | Digital Payments, Zoom app and more",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/todays-cache-digital-payments-zoom-app-and-more/article31229743.ece,"While many global businesses are scratching their heads on how to plan their operations in a post-COVID-19 world, two digital payment firms are using the crisis to build a new payment ecosystem in your car. And in another part of the world, in Africa, some tech start-ups are helping their continent tide over the coronavirus outbreak.
Closer to home, did you know that the Zoom app is sharing user data with Facebook?
IBM is giving free access to a range of IT tools to its clients to help them during the COVID-19 crisis. And finally, some tools to help you manage projects.
Digital payment firms are building in-car payment ecosystems
In-car payments is a fragmented market. It lacks a single interoperable system. Currently, different solution providers offer diverse options for making payment.
Many drivers connect their smartphones to cars using Android Auto or Apple CarPlay in the absence of built-in communication interface.
Visa and Mastercard are using this absence to build ecosystems that will link merchants and drivers to make and receive in-car payment. This is part of their Internet of Things strategy, according to a report byPaymentsSource.
The duo aims to stitch disparate systems together for car makers, payment infrastructure providers and other fintech firms to offer in-car commerce.
The digital payments firms see the COVID-19 situation nudging more people towards using private or personal vehicles. 
They view this push as an opportunity to develop in-car payments technology that can allow drivers to pay for fuel or food without handling cash or coming in contact with any potentially infected area.
Mastercard is working with GM, Honda, IBM, Amazon and other merchants and tech start ups to create car commerce platforms.
""Our role is to ensure that in-car payments are safe and simple for consumers, merchants and card companies,"" Mastercard’s senior vice president for digital future, products and innovation Femi Odunuga said. 
""We’re still in a nascent stage for car commerce. The technology is there, and initiatives are progressing, but adoption is tempered by the fact that you need vehicles to operate the requisite software, merchants to sell on these platforms, and consumers to transact.”
Visa, on the other hand, sees strong potential in cloud-based IoT payments and authentication via biometrics
 “Visa’s approach relies on its Visa Ready tokenization platform integrating with e-wallets such as Apple Pay to tokenize connected car payments and prevent consumers’ cards from being exposed,” said Bisi Boyle, Visa’s vice president of IoT.
How is Africa’s tech ecosystem responding to COVID-19 crisis
Africa was relatively untouched by the coronavirus until early March. Now, that has changed. 
“About 10 days ago we had 5 countries affected, now we’ve got 30,” WHO Regional Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti said at a press conference on March 19. “It’s has been an extremely rapid…evolution.”
As on Tuesday, COVID-19 cases in the Sub-Saharan Africa jumped to 3671 from 463 on March 18.
To stem the spread of coronavirus, start-ups in Africa are shifting a large volume of their transaction to digital payment, Techcrunch reported. They see physical cash as a conduit for the virus to spread.
Kenya has turned to mobile-money as a public-health tool, and the country’s largest telecom provider Safaricom implemented a fee-waiver on M-Pesa, a mobile-money product to reduce physical contact in exchange of currency notes.
In Lagos, a mobile payments company Paga adjusted fees to allow merchants to accept payments from Paga’s customers for free, according to a company statement.
CcHub, Africa’s largest innovation incubator based in Lagos and Nairobi, posted an open application on its website to provide funding blocks to companies working on COVID-19 related projects. The funding range from $5,000 to $100,000.
Zindi, a Cape Town-based crowd-solving start-up, opened a challenge to its 12,000 registered engineers on its platform to create models to predict global spread of COVID-19 in the next three months.
Did you know that Zoom app is sharing your data with Facebook?
In the past few weeks, Zoom app has become a household name, and is the go-to videoconferencing platform to connect with friends and family to beat the lockdown blues.
Based on the recent analysis by Motherboard, the app’s iOS version sends some analytics data to Facebook. The videoconferencing platform does this even if the user does not have a Facebook account.
While this kind of data sharing is not uncommon for apps that use Facebook’s software development kits (SDK), Zoom has not made its users aware of this transmission mechanism. 
Many apps use Facebook’s SDK to implement features into their apps easily.
When you open a Zoom app, it connects to Facebook’s Graph API, which is the main gateway for developers to get data in and out of Facebook.
Through this pathway, Facebook receives data from the user on the time they used the app, location and the device. It also gets the information on the user’s unique advertiser identifier. This is used to send targeted advertisements to the user.
Facebook requires that its developers be transparent to their users about the data their apps collects and sends to Facebook.
Zoom responded to Motherboard’s query in a statement confirming the data collection practice.
""Zoom takes its users’ privacy extremely seriously. We originally implemented the ‘Login with Facebook’ feature using the Facebook SDK in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform. However, we were recently made aware that the Facebook SDK was collecting unnecessary device data,"" the statement read, and described the data being collected as the same sorts of information that Motherboard identified.

Homeschooling is being discussed seriously as schools have closed due to the Covid-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-lessons-of-homeschooled-children-go-on-unaffected-even-as-the-covid-19-lockdown-goes-on-and-schools-try-ways-and-means-to-teach-students-remotely/article31228290.ece," “Homeschooling is not an easy option but it is definitely thinking out of the box,” says Kochi- based Cristelle Hart Singh who along with her husband Ravi Singh homeschooled their sons, 10-year-old Ishaan and eight-year-old Tej, based on child-led learning. “The child learns what he/she wants to learn as opposed to teaching them what we want them to learn,” she adds.

With the imposition of lockdown across the world to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, normal life has been thrown out of gear, affecting school-going children and their schedules. While virtual classrooms and online classes are back in focus, another non-traditional method — Home Schooling — is being discussed vigorously, especially when homes have become learning centres.
Mumbai-based Sharmila Govande says, “Homeschooling is based on a philosophy or approach that believes that children are natural learners and love to explore their curiosity, interests and passion. They have the ability to self direct their learning.” Sharmila is mother to three unschooling children and active in the homeschooling / unschooling circles in Mumbai and in organising events for “our tribe”.
There is a a growing environment — especially in cities like Bengaluru, Pune and Mumbai — in which children stay at home and are either taught a curriculum by the parents/a tutor, or learn as they grow, watching their parents and joining them in household chores and activities, depending on each family’s interpretation of non-formal education.
The oldest homeschoolers, Sharmila says, she knows of in India are in their 30s, “so it possibly began here three to four decades ago. No one has ever done a count, but I think there are roughly around 10,000 families across India.”
Looking at its history in India many British families homeschooled their children, pre-1947 often bringing tutors from England. Many expats continued doing the same after Independence and some Indian families were inspired by the system. “In fact pre-independence days, we have examples of Dr Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi (first Indian female physician), Savitri Bai Phule (first Indian female teacher) who were home educated. Of course there are many more examples,” says Sharmila.







“I am not saying home schooling is for everyone. But this is how we choose to raise our children now,” says Jaimie Chandrasekhar who along with her husband, musician DJ Sekhar, and her mother-in-law decided to home school her seven-year-old daughter Kaamaakhya. “The three adults in the family decided on homeschooling.”
Jaimie had quit her job as a education counsellor while in the eighth month of pregnancy and had prepared to raise her first born “differently”. “We took conscious decisions and home schooling is one of those,” she says. Kaamaakhya was not sent to a play school but when she was four she wanted to join a school. “We put her in one but, in six months, we found that she was not as expressive as before. Kaamaakhya is fiercely independent and highly expressive,” says Jaimie adding that the family does not believe in concept of “punishment for being naughty”. “Raising a child, teaching, learning is not a power game between children and adults, parent and child.”

Jaimie’s mother-in-law was a teacher who also conducted home tuitions alongside her work. She never felt that a formal schooling was required for successful adulthood.
For Rustum Usman, COO, Spia Tech India Pvt Ltd, who develops products for Industrial IOT (Internet Of Things), “education is a democratic thing. We don’t compel the children to learn anything.” Rustum chose to homeschool his four children — Eisa Usman, Moosa Usman, Aaisha Usman and Fathima Usman — because of his “negative experiences” at early school and has now begun putting out videos on homeschooling, explaining what it requires, its benefits and its flip side. 
A dyslexic, he had issues memorising multiplication tables and with spellings in school but “by the time I came to class 7, I had devised my own method of multiplication. I had become smarter in Math from self-learning,” says Rustum. In one video, he draws up a checklist of seven points required for homeschooling. 
Seven point checklist Rustum’s seven-point checklist on home schooling: i) One parent should work from home. ii) Parent should be focused, motivated and committed. iii) Peer group interaction should be organised either through meetings in parks or play dates. iv) The home or area should be spacious.v) There should be a good relationship between parent and child.vi) Homeschooling for a single child is not advisable and has its own challenges. vii) Homeschooling is inexpensive in comparison to private schools but expensive when compared to government-aided schools.
Rustum and his wife, Mariyam Vidhu Vijayan, follow the IGCSE syllabus as a basic curriculum for their children between three and eight years and some of their extra curricular activities are birding, programming and cooking.
His household follows “ a philosophy of software development,” where a schedule is charted and followed by each individual to suit their day. “If my son is curious about a math problem, he comes to me and I find a suitable time to help him learn,” says Rustum who has devised his own method of assessment. He has also tied up with alternative education schools like Bhoomi in Kochi for “non-academics” and used to take his children to the park for meeting with peer groups. His videos deal from teaching kitchen skills to saying ‘yes’ and doing away with ‘saying No’ culture.
Anand Bachchan, who set up Bhoomi, an alternative learning outfit, says that there are several reasons why families opt for home schools. Available educational options can be a disappointment, or families may not want children to face competition, religious choices or even distances. “Many families select a curriculum and teach children at home, which is the traditional method,” he explains, “but there is unschooling or de schooling where no curriculum is followed. The idea is that you are at home with the family and do things as a family — travel, cook, clean and learn along the way.
His personal idea of education is “to follow what interests the child”. At Bhoomi, the children follow “the Bhoomi rhythm” or flow of the day, something akin to a timetable. Children have fixed time for free play, song and dance, fruit time and an activity.
Currently the oldest child at Bhoomi is a 13-year-old and the learning environment is built on the contributions of parents and children at Bhoomi. “As we go on, the family decides about a child, if he or she wants to venture into formal schooling or pursue a syllabus from outside.”
Sharmila points out that many homeschoolers “have opted for mainstream higher education and have gone on to pursue degrees from colleges and universities. I understand that they do very well in whatever field they choose to study. I believe the main reason is because the choice is theirs and hence give their fullest to that experience.” She points out that the National Institute of Open schooling (NIOS) is considered at par with the CBSE curriculum and that there is also the option of giving Cambridge exams (IGCSE) as private candidates.
The obvious questions parents opting for homeschooling face is of a successful career for the child.
Sharmila says that stories abound of homeschoolers striking out careers in fields like graphic design, filmmaking, restauranting, software and app development, starting media projects and youtube channels. “many are artists, photographers and writers.”
Cristelle says that her son Ishaan, who dabbles with his father in carpentry, wishes to be an inventor and a chef. “ He learns Math that way, the boys are already talking about their careers.”
Recently the Bhoomi parents organised a Zoom meet for the children during the lockdown. The parents believe that, for higher education, the children can choose from Open Schools where exams can be taken when the student is ready. “There’s no competition and no stress but some children need classroom authority,” admits Cristelle.
Safe spaceEnhanced safety measures when the child is at home. Parents have to be more vigilant about domestic violence, child sexual abuse and Internet safety, with children being at home during a lockdown.
In homeschool communities, parents take turns to host children in their homes and teach them a certain skill. “Such communities are doing very well. Most cities have their local groups and events. We also have used social media effectively and hence have many WhatsApp and FB groups to ensure constant communication and sharing,” says Sharmila.
Meanwhile, during the lockdown, while the conventional school goers are coming to terms with the new normal, home schoolers are wondering what the commotion of is all about.",society
COVID-19: Couples live-stream intimate weddings under lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/coronavirus-lockdown-couples-live-stream-intimate-weddings/article31227583.ece,"As Sweatha Varthamanan and Aswin Ravi tied the knot along with over 20 of their closest friends and family in Chennai, nearly as many phones and recording devices were propped in front of their faces. They were live streaming the wedding to the other 200 guests who could not make it, because of the all-India lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It was surreal. Every girl dreams of her wedding, but this was nothing I had ever imagined. All empty chairs, and 15 smartphones in front of us, like we’re some celebrities,” laughs Sweatha, who married Aswin on March 26, the day after India went under lockdown. They cancelled every other ceremony — mehendi to reception, except for the rites.







As we battle the novel Coronavirus crisis, couples all over the world have been stripping down their big fat weddings to the bare essentials: a commitment to stay together through thick and thin. No grand decorations, just declarations of love.
A dream destination wedding in Las Vegas was what Autumn Conner had in mind. After all, the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) resident had waited over six months for her now husband Santosh Roychowdhury to fly in from India. “His visa took that long to clear. My side of the family was supposed to fly in from all over the country,” says Autumn, over a VoIP call from her hometown.
But then on March 14, two days prior to her wedding, Autumn had to call off her plans as the US started to bear the brunt of COVID-19. With social distancing and lockdown protocols kicking in across the country, the couple opted to play it safe, and decided to get married in a private ceremony that was attended by a little over 10 people.






The just married couple Laila and Boualem Bellil walk in the Stall Courtyard, a most frequented tourist spot, in Dresden, eastern Germany, Thursday, March 26, 2020. They celebrate today without wedding guests because of the government regulations and want to make up for the party next year. In order to slow down the spread of the coronavirus, the German government has considerably restricted public life and asked the citizens to stay at home. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

“It was strange. Funny too. We just smiled looking at each other,” says Autumn, as she shares pictures of the couple wearing masks and exchanging their wedding kiss. “We wore masks to remind people that it is important to take this pandemic seriously, in the US and around the world,” says Santosh, adding, “but love can overcome anything... even a pandemic.”
Similar reports have been coming in from Lithuania, Indonesia, Spain, Argentina, Italy and others. In a video that went viral on Twitter, a couple got married on the streets of New York, as their friend who performed the ceremony from a balcony, read out an excerpt from the very apt Love in the Time of Cholera, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.







 
Behind the cutesy pictures of masked kisses however, is a rolling stone of shifting plans, guests dropping out, vendors bargaining, and the accompanying stress.
“Forget social distancing, Aswin and I distanced ourselves from each other two days before the wedding,” says Sweatha, adding that their texts would only be “Good Morning”, “Good Night”, and “Did you eat?”
“Both of us were tense and we wanted to avoid arguments about the planning. When the situation is out of our control, it is better to be silent and calm,” she says.
Weddings were one of the exemptions to the lockdown, under certain conditions. According to a Tamil Nadu Government Order, “marriages already fixed on or before March 16, in marriage halls alone can be conducted, subject to a maximum number of 30 guests.”







And so, a detailed police permission has to be sought by the marriage hall, and by the couples getting married, citing the guests in attendance.
Pranesh Padmanabhan, founder of Studio 31, who covered Sweatha and Aswin’s wedding, explains how his team of photographers were picked up from their homes and dropped at the venue. “Our car was stopped six times for checking permissions,” he says. “After our photographers came back home, they self-quarantined for a week and took temperatures every few hours.”
“Fortunately, the caterer for our wedding agreed to serve to a smaller guest list. Only, instead of cooking at the venue, he brought food from his kitchen to the hall,” says Sweatha. In another wedding that Studio 31 covered in mid-March, the couple had to arrange for food parcels for the 28 guests in attendance, from the nearest Saravana Bhavan after the caterer cancelled.
“The coming three months are known as the wedding season in India. We normally would have about 140 bookings during this period, but 90 % of them dropped out. Now we have about 20, and even they are unsure,” he says. Pranesh has made an effort to document these surreal times through his photographs: Corporation workers hosing down the venue with disinfectants, guests dining a metre apart from each other.







The Government has instructed marriage halls to “return the advance paid by the public for all cancelled bookings.” However, some like Pushpa Sridhar claim they are still in the dark about refunds: instead, they are being asked by vendors to set another date.
“It is very disappointing for both families. Airlines have asked our guests to switch the booking to a later date within the next six months. Which means our relatives are asking us if we have set a date yet, but we can’t do that until there is some sense of normalcy!” says Pushpa, mother of the groom.
On the other hand, Arjun (name changed on request) used the lockdown as the opportunity to have the intimate eco-friendly wedding he and his wife had always pictured. “My wife’s family had wanted a grander wedding, and we debated postponing it. But we went ahead with an intimate affair, because in the end, that is what she and I had wanted.”
Arjun proudly recalls how his was one of those few weddings where everybody present was involved in what was happening, rather than having personal conversations. He too had live streamed the ceremony for around 300-400 people, much like Sweatha and Aswin.
Thankful for the relaxed affair, Aswin says, “If you think about the ones closest to you, that you want around you, they wouldn’t be more than 30, anyway.”

Coronavirus outbreak: Keralites employed in China return to work,https://www.thehindu.com/society/coronavirus-outbreak-keralites-employed-in-china-return-to-work/article31226496.ece,"
Riyad Muhammedali, Binoy AK and Appu VK, colleagues at Base FX, a visual effects and animation company in Xiamen City in Fujian province of China, had big plans for the week-long holiday, which was to start on January 25, the first day of the Chinese New Year. However, instead, life turned topsy-turvy as COVID-19 brought the country to a standstill. Their focus moved to finding ways to keep their families safe. Riyad opted to stay in China, while Binoy and Appu took the earliest flights back home.
Now as China limps back to normal, Binoy and Appu have returned and are back at work. Sharing their experiences over the phone with MetroPlus, the trio say that people continue to take precautions, like using masks, hand sanitisers and avoiding physical proximity. Also, temperature is taken in office buildings, apartment or shops. Almost all companies have reopened. Public transport is fully operational, including the metro. And shops are doing brisk business.

When my friends and colleagues decided to leave for their respective countries, my logic was that home was the safest place at that moment. I didn’t want to risk the health of my wife and two children, especially of our seven-month-old daughter by travelling.
Even though Xiamen, an island, is over 1,000 kilometres away from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, cases were reported here as well. I was worried when there was an exponential rise in the number of positive cases and deaths across China. But, everything was in place for the lockdown. We live in a housing society, or community as we call it. It is a huge area with a total of 10 gates, with four buildings of 32 floors inside each gate. There are four flats in each floor.
The first thing our community did was to issue passes to every adult to prevent the entry of any outsider, thus ensuring a local lockdown. We got regular updates and guidelines on the community app. Entire residential area was disinfected; they placed a plastic coating on the lift buttons and it was changed on hourly basis. Health workers took our temperature daily. Grocery was delivered via the app of the supermarket and kept at separate trays meant for each household, with the security personnel of buildings. For four weeks I stepped out of my apartment only to collect these goods.
We went by the rules and had trust in the governmental machinery after having worked here for the last three years. Our office opened three weeks ago. Positive cases are still being reported, but Wuhan hasn’t had a single case over the last one week. My wife hasn’t stepped out of our apartment yet because the fear is still there.
Online classes have started for our son who is in class one. Although cinemas and certain shopping malls haven't opened yet, life is back on track. Many restaurants were functioning during the time of the lockdown as well, but people preferred to stay at home and order things online.

I have been working in Xiamen for nearly two years now, there are eight of us from Kerala. While four of us have returned, the rest are in India because of the lockdown. Even though things are under control here now I am worried about my wife and eight-month-old daughter in Kerala as the number of positive cases are on the rise in the State.
When I reached here on March 13, I had to be on 14-day quarantine because there was a spike in the number of positive cases, presumably because people had started returning to China from their respective home countries. First I was asked to be under home quarantine, but was later directed to move to a hotel to finish the quarantine period. A taxi was arranged by people in our community itself to shift to the hotel. My temperature was monitored on a daily basis and two swab tests were also done during this period.
 I left China and flew to Kerala on January 26 with my wife, Anu, and our eight-month-old daughter, Eva. Eva had a bout of fever two weeks prior to our journey. We have to arrange for an interpreter at any hospital in China since we don’t know the language: I knew treatment would be difficult if she fell ill again during the viral outbreak. But travelling had its problems as there was a possibility of getting infected while in transit. It was impossible to make my daughter wear a mask, although I had arranged for a mini-mask. Nevertheless, I decided to take the risk and took the flight to India.
We felt Kerala was safe because there were no COVID-19 cases in the state then. When we landed in Kochi, we went through a health check-up since we were coming from China. Once I reached home, I had no idea about the 28-day home quarantine, but officials of the Kerala State health department guided me. I was constantly in touch with my Chinese friends and decided to return to China once there was a decrease in the number of cases here.

I was in Kerala from January 29 to March 11 with my family. And they were not happy about my decision to return to China. I had travelled back via Malaysia and it took more than three hours to clear the immigration here. Now I have finished my 14-day quarantine in China as well, first at my apartment and later in a hotel. It was ensured that I didn’t step out of the hotel room. If I went out it was not possible to use the room key to get in again!
While I worked from my apartment, it was difficult from the hotel room because of poor internet connectivity. I didn’t work while in Kerala because the company provided work from home facilities only for those who stayed back in China.
Now I am going to office, something I have been looking forward to for so many days. Our team is working on a new project. I have worked as an animator in Sony's upcoming animation movie Wish Dragon. Things are looking bright. It is nice to see families in the park with their kids during the weekend, though they are wearing masks.
I would have stayed in China itself but for the frantic calls from my family. I wasn’t scared because I had enough food and other essential commodities at home. I also had trust in the measures being taken by the government and didn’t want to contract any infection by travelling.",society
Covid-19: Namma Navakkarai provides meals to personnel at the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border,https://www.thehindu.com/society/covid-19-namma-navakkarai-provides-meals-to-personnel-at-the-tamil-nadu-kerala-border/article31225329.ece,"Coimbatore
“It is thengaai saadam and thattapayiru poriyal for lunch today,” says Maheshwaran NS over the phone. A food truck has just left carrying lunch packets for over 100 people who are on duty on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. “The health department staff, the police, and the army are all camped at the border to screen COVID-19 cases to prevent entry into Tamil Nadu. They check vehicles entering the state and also conduct medical check-ups. They are on duty 24/7 to safeguard us.”
Maheshwaran is the founder and president of Namma Navakkarai, an NGO located at Navakkarai village in Walayar (20 km from the city) on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. The group that has 10 active volunteers recently revived the Oorani Lake in Mavuthampathi Panchayat that supports farming in the village.

The Namma Navakkarai team volunteered at the camp that was set up to tackle COVID-19 and learnt that the food for the people on duty there arrived late and was insufficient. They decided to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner for camp members at Walayar and Velanthavalam. They identified a centralised kitchen at Walayar, sought out a head cook and started. “ Our Mavuthampathi Panchayat supported us with provisions. As for vegetables, villagers in the border areas generously offered us regular supplies of tomatoes, onions, brinjal, drumstick, and lady’s finger from their farms. They turned up with baskets full of vegetables every day. It was heartening,” says Maheswaran.

Their day starts at the crack of dawn as they go about making breakfast. “We stick to a standard menu of idli, pongal, khichdi, or upma and ensure that we deliver by 8.00 am. Then, we prepare lunch that often includes tomato rice and brinjal poriyal or sambar rice with broad beans poriyal... This way, the personnel can have a bowl of vegetables every day. Dinner is rotis and a mixed vegetable gravy. We are a small team. We wear masks and maintain hygiene at the kitchen. We wash our hands regularly with sanitisers.”
Maheshwaran says contributions have been pouring in from people. “Someone dropped by and donated 100 kg of atta. Another person supplies five litres of milk every day. Now, we make tea, twice a day. When we wind up it is well past 10.00 pm. But, we want to continue as long a the camp does. This is just our way of showing gratitude to the people who are on duty to protect us.”",society
"Maruti, Hyundai sales skid",https://www.thehindu.com/business/maruti-hyundai-sales-skid/article31230987.ece,"Already reeling under a prolonged slowdown and the transition to BS-VI fuel norms, auto sector saw its woes being compounded by the 21-day nationwide lockdown. Manufacturers witnessed a decline in sales in the range of 44%-90% in their domestic wholesales in March 2020.
The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki posted a 47.4% decline in passenger vehicles (PVs) in the domestic market to 76,240 units, compared with the more than 1.45 lakh units sold in March 2019. The company, however, said that sales during March 2020 were not comparable with that in March 2019 “due to the suspension of operations with effect from March 22, 2020, in line with national policy.”

SBI eases settlement deadline by 3 months,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sbi-eases-settlement-deadline-by-3-months/article31230287.ece,"State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to extend the timeline for payment of settlement amount by three months due to the 21-day lockdown. 
“SBI has come forward to extend the timeline for payment of settlement amount by three months. Now, customers, on-boarded under settlement scheme SBI OTS 2019 / Rin Samadhan 19-20/General compromise can meet payment obligation by June 30, 2020,” SBI said. 
Under the One Time Settlement (OTS) 2019 scheme, the extension will be available only to those customers where the first two instalments of 5% / 15% and 20% / 25% have been received within the stipulated 30 and 60 days, respectively. 
The balance OTS amount can be paid by June 30, it said, while adding it would not charge any interest on the amount for this extended period. Under the Rin Samadhan scheme, the timeline for receipt of acceptance of OTS proposal along with upfront payment from borrowers has been extended up to June 30, from the current March 31 and up to September 30 for recovery of the entire OTS amount. 
“This will provide an extended opportunity to borrowers who are unable to visit branches owing to the lockdown,” SBI said.
Also, payment obligations for borrowers with outstanding as on March 01, 2020 under ‘General Compromise’ category has been extended by three months, without charging any interest for the additional period. On working capital loans, C.S. Setty, MD, SBI, said because firms have to pay interest on such loans at the end of the moratorium period, banks are evaluating the option of requesting the RBI for some relief in terms of asset classification. This is because these companies may not be in a position to repay immediately after the moratorium is lifted.
The RBI had allowed banks in respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit or over draft to borrowers facing stress and said lenders may recalculate the ‘drawing power’ by reducing the margins or by reassessing the working capital cycle.
“This relief shall be available in respect of all such changes effected up to May 31, 2020 and shall be contingent on the lending institutions satisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from COVID-19. Further, accounts provided relief under these instructions shall be subject to subsequent supervisory review with regard to their justifiability on account of the economic fallout from COVID-19,” the RBI had said.

Sugar movement resumes,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sugar-movement-resumes/article31230276.ece,"Movement of sugar, which was disrupted initially when the countrywide lockdown was implemented as a precaution against COVID-19, has resumed.
Dispatches have picked up in the last four or five days, according to the Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA). 
The “ISMA has assured the government that there is enough sugar with the sugar mills, and therefore, there will not be any problem of availability of this essential food item for consumers,” the association said in a press statement on Wednesday.
As of March 31, 2020, 457 sugar mills, which started crushing this season — from October 2019 to September 2020 — have so far produced 232.74 lakh tonnes of sugar. This is nearly 64 lakh tonnes less than what was produced during the same period last year.
 As many as 186 mills continued production, mainly in north India. The mills are taking efforts to ensure that wherever there is availability of sugarcane, it is procured and crushed so that farmers do not incur losses. During the first few days of the lockdown, there were also concerns about availability of inputs such as lime and sulphur. 
The lime quarries and kilns in Rajasthan were closed down. This was taken up with the Rajasthan government and there is smooth availability of all inputs now, the ISMA said. ",business
"SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank activate moratorium",https://www.thehindu.com/business/sbi-hdfc-bank-icici-bank-activate-moratorium/article31230274.ece,"State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender and private sector lenders ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have started activating the loan repayment moratorium option for customers.
The moratorium was announced by the Reserve Bank of India last week in view of the financial stress faced by borrowers following the lockdown declared on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.
SBI customers who want to avail themselves of the moratorium, are required to send an email to avail the option. The email address will depend on the circle from where the customer has taken the loan. The email addresses of all the circles have been mentioned in the SBI website.“No action is required. They may continue to pay in usual course,” SBI said of customers who do not wish to avail the moratorium option.
SBI has also clarified that if a customer has already paid the EMI for March, then the amount will be reversed if the customer sends in a request. “Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loan during the moratorium period,” SBI said.
Commenting on impact in case of home loans if the EMI is deferred, SBI said that for a loan of ₹30 lakh with a remaining maturity of 15 years, the net additional interest would be about ₹2.34 lakh, which is equal to eight EMIs.
“For a loan of ₹6 lakh with a remaining maturity of 54 months, the additional interest payable would be ₹19,000 approximately. equal to additional 1.5 EMIs,” SBI said on the impact in the case of auto loans.

March GST revenue drops below ₹1 lakh cr.,https://www.thehindu.com/business/march-gst-revenue-drops-below-1-lakh-cr/article31230254.ece,"Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections for March 2020 stood at ₹97,597 crore, dropping below the ₹1 lakh-crore mark after four months. 
Gross GST revenue for the month was 8% lower than that of March 2019, according to Finance Ministry data released on Wednesday.
For the full financial year 2019-20, gross GST collections grew 4% in comparison to the previous year.
As the March revenue collections are based on the business conducted in February, these figures do not take into account the full impact of COVID-19 and the consequent shutdown of many business sectors in India. Analysts warn that next month’s revenues are likely to dip much further.
Although GST revenue from domestic transactions dropped 4% in comparison with March 2019, there was a 23% fall in the tax collected on import of goods. “Global trade was affected by COVID-19 in February itself, so we could be seeing the result of that,” said Sachin Menon, national head, indrect taxes, KPMG in India.
There has also been a sharp 7% decline in the filing of February GSTR-3B returns, with only 76.5 lakh returns being filed till March 31 in comparison with the more than 83 lakh filed in the previous two months. “It seems that many businesses may not have been able to pay GST because of the liquidity issues being faced after the lockdown,” said Pratik Jain, partner and indirect tax leader at PwC India.
The situation is likely to worsen. “With most businesses being non-operational for a considerable period in March and the relaxation of delayed payments allowed, collections in the coming quarter would see quite a fall,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at Ernst and Young. Small businesses have been allowed a three-month deferment of GST payments due to the COVID-19 situation, and there is a wider industry demand for a moratorium on payments and reduction in rates.
“At this stage, it is necessary for businesses to conserve cash in order to enable resumption of operations once the lockdown ends. Any deferral of the GST payment timelines by a few months would significantly assist them in this process,” said M.S. Mani, partner, Deloitte India.
Of the total collections, central GST stood at ₹19,183 crore, State GST atwas ₹25,601 crore and integrated GST atwas ₹44,508 crore. Cess stood at ₹8,306 crore. The government had settled ₹19,718 crore to CGST and ₹14,915 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement.

“I didn’t expect such a reach for the video. I am getting messages from across India and even abroad,” says Ajmal over phone from his home at Changanassery in Kottayam district. He adds, “My professional commitments have been stalled due to the lockdown. So, instead of wasting time I thought of doing something interesting. I came across this song in a video my friend had sent me. I was hearing that version of the song for the first time and felt that I should put it to use somewhere. As the ‘Namaste Trump’ event at Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, was a much-discussed event, I thought of giving it a try. And it clicked!” says the 24-year-old.
Ajmal started his Instagram page for mash-up videos two years ago and most of them have gone viral. There are over 50 videos on the page, with another popular one being American wrestler and WWE superstar Big Show and WWE’s chief branding officer Stephanie McMahon supposedly saying the dialogues of Nakulan (Suresh Gopi) and Ganga (Sobhana) from an iconic scene in the Malayalam movie, Manichitrathazhu.
Fact fileAn alumnus of Maya Academy of Advanced Cinematics in Pune, from where he learnt animation, VFX and post production, Ajmal started out as a cinematographer with a Marathi film, Dhap. He was an assistant director in the Malayalam films Kappirithuruthu and Love Action Drama. He has also been a spot editor and is much sought-after in Malayalam film industry for making promo cuts, teasers and trailers of movies. He has directed short films and has done cinematography and editing in music videos, short films, documentaries and ad films.He is all set to turn independent as an editor and cinematographer with a Malayalam film. “If the lockdown wasn’t there, the shoot would have begun on April 10. It is a good project and I still can’t believe that I am doing it,” he says.
The first mash-up video he created was of the Joker-Batman scene from The Dark Knight with dialogues from Maheshinte Prathikaram, picturised on Soubin Shahir and Alencier. Among other videos that fetched lakhs of likes are those of Bruno Mars dancing to the tune of ‘Margazhiye malligaye’ from Megham, Rihanna’s video with the track of Popy umbrella ad, scene from Guardians of Galaxy with dialogues from Aniyathipravu and Modi’s speech at a rally with lottery announcement.
Ajmal says that there is no short cut to creating these videos. “It takes several hours to mix and match the scenes. I spent seven to eight hours on the Trump video alone. If you are taking a song or dance number, matching rhythm and steps are not that difficult. But the toughest part is lip sync. It is possible to experiment with all videos. However, you have to keep on trying to get the perfect match,"" he says, adding, “At the same time you shouldn’t compromise on humour.”",movies
Sri Lankan hip hop artiste ADK: ‘Lityananda is not Nithyananda’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sri-lankan-hip-hop-artiste-adk-lityananda-is-not-nithyananda/article31226903.ece,"It was a whim, and the question of “whatever happened to him?”, that prompted me to look up ADK, more famous in Tamil Nadu as Dinesh Kanagaratnam, on Instagram.
The Sri Lankan hip hop artiste, who shot to fame after remixing Ceylon Manohar’s ‘Surangani’ (which then found its way to Tamil cinema, courtesy Vijay Antony, as the song ‘Aathichudi’ in the 2009 film TN-07 AL 4777), had popped up in my playlist for a track named ‘Lityananda’.
 




 
Of particular interest to me was the character featured on the track’s poster; the art bearing an eerie likeness to the self-styled fugitive godman Nithyananda who fled the country last year after being charged on counts of rape, child abuse and kidnapping. Nithyananda, then, infamously, set up a micronation named Kailasa — believed to be on an island he purchased, and has holed up in this place, the whereabouts of which have yet to be conclusively established, along with his followers.
I reached out to Dinesh, who is presently stationed in Singapore, where, unlike many major cities across the world, no lockdown restrictions have been enforced.

He makes it clear that ‘Lityananda’, with its quirky and funny double entendre lyrics, is by no means a misplaced tribute, or anything remotely close to it, for a personality who is on the run from law enforcement.
“I don’t believe anybody who calls oneself God. I’m aware that this song will definitely attract negative comments from his ‘devotees’, but I just wanted to make people laugh. During this time, when everyone’s minds is on the pandemic, I did not want to do a song on the Coronavirus. I wanted to make a song on someone who escaped the virus,” he laughs, and adds: “If you think about it, [Nithyananda] had the foresight, didn’t he? He knew he had to quarantine. That is why he ran.”
It was the “lyrical” nature of Nithyananda’s now infamously famous social media sermons that inspired Dinesh to write ‘Lityananda’. “I used to have a good laugh listening to what he spoke, and though all of us mock him, it was inspiring. All kinds of people inspire my creative irrespective of whether they are good or bad,” he says.
Lityananda’s verse reflects this sentiment albeit in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Sample this line: “Kailasam pogalam jollya oyla, OLA-willa booku panni all ah pogalama, Somarasam irukudu kinnathila baama, Kudicha John Cena can see me how ma.”

But using a third party’s likeness to promote material seldom is a straight path. It could attract legal troubles. “But it isn’t Nithyananda who is on the poster,” says Dinesh; his response prompting me to take another look at the art design. “It is me in that photo,” he adds.
Dinesh explains thus: “If you are an actor and you wish to impersonate someone, then you need to look at least 90% similar to that person. I have long held an acting desire, and since I cannot be a part of a feature film, I thought I could be in the poster. And Lityananda is not Nithyananda. He is another godman,” laughs Dinesh.
Dinesh collaborated with music producer OfRo, known for his work in filmmaker Pa Ranjith’s The Casteless Collective and his association with the Tamil rapper Arivu on the independent album Therukural, for ‘Lityananda’.

“OfRo (real name Rohith Abraham) is a crazy, super cool guy. We met a long time ago in Harris Jayaraj’s studio.” Dinesh had crooned for ‘Universal Cop’ track for Suriya’s Singam franchise film, S3. “We were supposed to do a song four years ago but I couldn’t concentrate as I was working with many music producers at that point. In fact, I did graphic design on Therukural,” says Dinesh, who is an art director by trade.
I mention that “Tamil Twitter” (the colloquial collective noun used to refer to twitterati tweeting on Tamil popculture content) had been raving about ‘Aathichudi’ in the last few days. When Vijay Antony came across Dinesh’s remixed version of ‘Surangani’ (which predates YouTube’s rise to popularity), he wanted to incorporate it in a Tamil film.
Though it introduced him to the Tamil film industry, Dinesh has a few regrets over how ‘Aathichudi’ turned out. “When I worked with AR Rahman in Kadal, I was credited as Aaryan Dinesh Kanagaratnam. I adopted the stage name ADK for my hip hop work,” he says. Being credited differently in various platforms hits the brand building process, and Dinesh suffered as a result. “I wish more people knew it was I who had sung ‘Aathichudi’ because 10 years later I’m standing in the same place where I started, and I’m still trying to make a difference to music,” he adds.

But the mainstreaming of hip hop music in Tamil films is happening, especially since the rise to prominence of musicians like Hip Hop Tamizha. More opportunities are being offered to artistes like Arivu (who was the voice behind ‘Vaathi Raid’ in Vijay’s upcoming film Master directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj). But Dinesh says he prefers to be “picky” with whom he chooses to work with in the future. “I don’t do vocals for money. I want this culture of rap being a filler in songs to change; rap needs to be a mainstream act. For these reasons, I think I’m done with film in India unless it is Rahman or Yuvan Shankar Raja or Anirudh,” he says.
For now, though, Dinesh is busy writing a script, and is collaborating with Yuvan Shankar Raja to create “either a web series or a feature film”.
“I’m making use of the Coronavirus period to write my script,” he concludes.",movies
Kannada actor-filmmaker Guruprasad starts new Facebook show to combat COVID-19 lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannada-actor-filmmaker-guruprasad-starts-new-facebook-show-to-combat-covid-19-lockdown/article31226860.ece,"
Although Kannada film director, Guruprasad has many films to his credit, his name is synonymous with Mata and Eddelu Manjunatha. Both these films went on to become blockbusters. Jaggesh plays the lead roles in both the cult films. Guruprasad even won the Karnataka State Film Award for the best screenplay and the Filmfare Award as the best director in 2009 for Eddelu Manjunatha.
Mata dealt with the mutts and Eddelu Manjunatha was about a lazy man. The Guruprasad-Jaggesh duo come together again after 10 years for Ranganayaka. “This will also be an outrageous comedy and will keep you in splits,” the director says with a laugh. Guruprasad has kept himself busy not just directing films, but also doing cameos in films and being a part of reality shows on television. 







Now, with the lockdown due to COVID-19, the director has started a comedy series on his FB page — Guruprasad Manjunatha. The series, titled Hastya Vratha will be on till the lockdown ends. On the show, which streams at 9 pm every night, Guruprasad talks to people about films, the virus, safety, God, how to deal with the lockdown, music and more. 
“There is a new topic everyday. The idea is to entertain people and make them laugh. Every one is talking about the virus. I would like to bring in some comic relief to people who are bombarded with COVID-19 news.”







Guruprasad says the cinema he covers on the show, is the result of his three-decade long research on cinema. “Normally I share this material in my school, Guruprasad Scriptwriting and Film Direction, but now I felt it will make the show interesting as many of my followers are film buffs.” 
Guruprasad is a firm believer in the art of comedy and believes it is his mission to make people laugh. “I don’t like violence on screen as it sends out a wrong message. I feel it is cheap to portray violence on screen as it promotes the philosophy that it is okay to wield a machete. Comedy is difficult but we can make a point using humour.”
Describing his show as a direct interaction with his audience, Guruprasad says, “There is no censorship of any kind.” Being in lockdown is not new to him, the director says. “When I was writing my first film, Mata I was in isolation at home for six months. While working on Eddelu ... I worked alone for almost three months. So sitting at home is not an issue for me. Currently, I am again using this time to work on my new film Ranganayaka, which will take off as soon as things return to normal. The film is also a comedy and will be a treat for Jaggesh’s and my fans.” 
The actor-director also believes “it is natural for man to live in harmony with nature. I feel we overstepped the boundaries in the way we travelled and lived. Take the people of Bengaluru itself. We travel for two to three hours to get to work. How unnatural is that? It is a waste of time and energy. How can this be good or even right? I hope now we realise our folly and treat nature with more caution and live more wisely.” 
He applauds the government, police and the medical staff for “being out there in the forefront and managing the lockdown.”",movies

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her family had to turn to their iPhones to film the season finale owing to the coronavirus lockdown, reports aceshowbiz.com.
Production on the current 18th season of the series was shut down just before Kim and her relatives were able to shoot the last episode.
Kim said on a video chat with comedian Jimmy Fallon in an episode of “The Tonight Show: At Home Edition”, that the finale would serve as an isolation diary.
“We filmed the entire season except for the last episode. So now that we’ve shut down production, it’ll be all of us in quarantine filmed separately by ourselves. We have tripods set up, and our iPhones, and the whole last episode will be what we do in quarantine... I literally have no idea what everyone else has been doing!” she said.
Kim said that she had broken her self-isolation to get her youngest sister Kylie Jenner, to help her get camera-ready for the remote “Tonight Show” chat, conducted at the home of their mother Kris Jenner.
The reality star, who is married to rapper Kanye West, admitted she had not met Kylie over weeks.
“That’s the first time I’ve seen her, because the whole family is distancing so we haven’t even seen each other. So I snuck out and I’m at my mum’s house in her glam room because there’s a door from the outside, so this is all she’ll let us in,” she grinned.",movies

With a message via brother Indrajith, the actor-director shed light on the issues they are facing, which prompted his film’s director Blessy to request the Film Chamber as well as the Kerala CM to help bring them back to India.
Prithviraj said in his message, “Hello all. Hope everyone is holding up and doing their best to stay safe during these tough times. On 24/03/2020, the shooting of Aadujeevitham in Jordan was temporarily stopped due to the prevailing circumstances. But after an appraisal of our situation, the authorities were convinced that our unit was isolated and operating safely within the confines of the Wadi Rum desert, and hence, we were given a go-ahead for the shoot.”
He added that soon after, the prevailing restrictions in Jordan had to be further strengthened as a precautionary measure and as a result, their shoot permission was revoked on March 27. “Following that, our team has been staying at the desert camp in Wadi Rum. We have now been told that an immediate permission for shoot to resume is unlikely due to the situation and hence, our next best option would be to return to India at the first available opportunity,” explained the actor-director.
Prithviraj explained that the Aadujeevitham team had originally planned to stay and shoot in Wadi Rum till the second week of April, with their accommodation, food and supplies taken care of for the immediate future.
“But obviously, what happens beyond that timeline is a matter of concern. We have a doctor in our team who’s carrying out medical check ups for each member of the crew every 72 hours, and we are also subjected to periodic check ups by a government-appointed Jordanian doctor. We completely understand that given the circumstances around the world, our team of 58 might not be the biggest concern of authorities back home now, and rightfully so. But we also felt that it was our duty to let all concerned know about the situation and keep them updated.”
Prithviraj added that he understood that there are thousands of Indians around the world waiting to get back home, and that he hopes when the appropriate time and opportunity arrives, they will also able to come back to India. “Till then, I hope all of you stay safe and let’s collectively hope and pray that life gets back to normal soon,” he concluded.",movies

Captive audience: film festivals come home ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dharamshala-international-film-festival-sets-up-online-viewing-room-on-its-website-where-it-will-be-streaming-its-alumnis-films-free-of-cost-to-viewers-across-the-world/article31222657.ece,"“Bringing independent cinema to the mountains” has been the catchline of the Dharamshala International Film Festival (DIFF). Now, it’s unspooling the indies on a computer, laptop, mobile or tablet near you. In a unique attempt in the Indian film festival circuit, DIFF set up an online Viewing Room on its website on Tuesday, where it will be streaming its alumni’s films, free of cost to viewers across the world. 
DIFF will be showcasing a set of four to six films every couple of weeks.
The idea of sharing the films that the festival has showcased over the years took root ten days back. “Seeing the situation, the fact that everyone is at home, we thought of doing something positive,” says festival director and filmmaker Ritu Sarin. They reached out to the alumni filmmakers and were overwhelmed by the tremendous response they got in return.
“With COVID-19 reshaping the world, we have been thinking about how to reach out [to the DIFF regulars and patrons] and at the moment the filmmakers also don’t know what the future holds for them,” said Ms. Sarin. The idea then, for all, has been to keep up the spirits and seek inspiration in these uncertain times in cinema itself.
The entire venture is being run on the goodwill between the filmmakers and the festival. “DIFF is run by a no-profit trust. It’s [Viewing Room] in keeping with the spirit of the festival,” said Ms. Sarin.
The programming, too, reflects the festival’s thrust — politically and socially conscious cinema. At a time when online content consumption is rising exponentially, DIFF is not offering the regular popular stuff but a carefully curated list of rare, alternate films with artistic merit, underlined with a humane touch and reflecting the political realities of our times. When we are being forced to shut out the world, these films open a small window to it; when individuals and their respective countries are in a lockdown mode, they offer a fantastic, expansive political and cultural peep into our uncomfortable realities.
 Sean McAllister’s A Syrian Love Story (2015) is a heartbreaking documentary that dwells on the human toll in the Middle Eastern conflict, through its focus is on five years of the life of a couple that first fell in love in a Syrian prison and fled to France via Lebanon to seek political asylum. But could they truly abandon the home called Syria? 
Naeem Mohaiemen’s experimental film Tripoli Cancelled (2017) looks at the unsettling feeling between being at home and in asylum through a week in the life of a man stranded in an abandoned airport. Jeon Soo-Il’s A Korean in Paris (2015) is about a man cast away in the French capital in search of his wife who suddenly goes missing on their honeymoon. Prasanna Vithanage’s With You Without You (2013) juxtaposes the healing power of love against personal traumas and political strife in the wake of the Civil War in Sri Lanka.
Coming up in the weeks ahead — Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi’s 5 Broken Cameras, Abhay Kumar’s Placebo (2014), Andrew Hinton and Johnny Burke’s Tashi and the Monk (2014) and Ritu Sarin and Tanzing Sonam’s When Hari Got Married (2013).
Meanwhile, Jio Mami Mumbai Film Festival With Star, even as it opened for entries for its next edition in November, has begun sharing a comprehensive list of films across 21 years that have been screened at the festival and in their year round programme, also pointing out the streaming platforms where these titles can be accessed. The festival came up with the first list of international and Indian (both features and shorts) films for the year 2019 on Sunday.
New York Indian Film Festival (NYIFF) might have been postponed for the while but, to stay in touch with its members and supporters, festival director Aseem Chhabra has begun recommending one film or show a week — kicking off with Aijaz Khan’s Hamid — that is available on streaming platforms in the U.S. They are calling it the weekly ‘NYIFF At Home Festival’.",movies

“Presently, the value of the goods or software exports made by exporters is required to be realised fully and repatriated to the country within nine months from the date of exports. 
“In view of the disruption caused by the pandemic, the time period for realisation and repatriation of export proceeds for exports made up to or on July 31, 2020, has been extended to 15 months from the date of export,” the RBI said. The measure will enable exporters to realise their receipts, especially from COVID-19 affected countries, within the extended period, and also provide greater flexibility to exporters to negotiate future export contracts with buyers abroad.
The central bank has also formed an advisory committee to review the ways and means limit for State governments and union territories. Till the panel submits its report, the central bank has increased the ways and means advances limit by 30% for States and union territories.
“Pending submission of the final recommendations by the Committee, it has been decided to increase the WMA limit by 30% from the existing limit for all States/UTs to enable State governments to tide over the situation arising from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised limits will come into force with effect from April 1, 2020 and will be valid till September 30, 2020, the RBI said. 
The ‘Ways and Means Advances’ is a scheme that helps meet mismatches in receipts and payments of the government. Under this scheme, a government can avail itself of immediate cash from the RBI. 
The central bank has also deferred the implementation of counter cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) for banks.
“Based on the review and empirical analysis of CCyB indicators, it has been decided that it is not necessary to activate CCyB for a period of one year or earlier, as may be necessary,” the RBI said. ",economy

The measure will enable the exporters to realise their receipts, especially from COVID-19-affected countries within the extended period and also provide greater flexibility to the exporters to negotiate future export contracts with buyers abroad.
The central bank has also formed an advisory committee to review ways and means limit for State governments and Union Territories.
""Pending submission of the final recommendations by the Committee, it has been decided to increase WMA limit by 30% from the existing limit for all States/UTs to enable the State Governments to tide over the situation arising from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Virus fears roil markets as indices plummet,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/virus-fears-roil-markets-as-indices-plummet/article31230316.ece,"Tracking a weak trend in the Asian markets, Indian benchmarks lost heavy ground on Wednesday even as a drastic fall in domestic auto sales numbers led to heightened concerns over potential economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 30-share Sensex lost 1,203.18 points, or 4.08%, to close at 28,265.31. The broader Nifty ended the day at 8,253.80, down 343.95 points, or 4%. The India VIX index, however, dropped a little over 6% on Wednesday, a day after shedding over 10%.
Elsewhere in Asia, Nikkei was down by about 4.5% while Hang Seng lost over 2%. Kospi also closed almost 4% lower as the global toll of COVID-19 neared the 45,000-mark with almost nine lakh confirmed cases.
In India, the total number of confirmed cases neared the 1,700-mark with the last few days witnessing a steep rise thereby adding to investor concerns on the long-term economic impact.
Incidentally, auto sales more than halved for most auto majors in March with sector leader Maruti Suzuki reporting an almost 48% drop in sales.
“Majority of the automobile companies reported disappointing volume performance for March 2020, way below estimates,” said Mitul Shah, vice-president (research), Reliance Securities.
“Sales were impacted by the nationwide lockdown and BS VI transition. We expect similar deterioration in volumes over the next 1-2 months due to the ongoing lockdown amid COVID-19 issue,” added Mr. Shah.
In the Sensex pack, software majors like Tech Mahindra, Infosys and TCS were among the top losers as COVID-19coronavirus cases registered a sharp rise in the U.S. with over 4,000 deaths.
Apart from the software entities, banking heavyweights continued to fall further with Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India and Axis Bank among the top losers.
The overall market breadth, however, was balanced with about 1,100 stocks on the advance and decline list. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at a little over ₹1,100 crore on Wednesday. ",markets

 Global equities skidded as weak factory data from Asia and a steady rise in coronavirus cases pointed to the tough road ahead for the world economy. 
 Dismal auto sales numbers and reports of India missing its fiscal deficit targets by a wide margin further sapped investor confidence here, traders said.

Legendary jazz musician Ellis Marsalis Jr. dies of coronavirus at 85,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/legendary-jazz-musician-ellis-marsalis-jr-dies-of-coronavirus-at-85/article31238079.ece," Legendary jazz pianist and teacher Ellis Marsalis Jr. died at the age of 85 due to complications of coronavirus.
He had passed away on Wednesday, reports usatoday.com.
“It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of my father, Ellis Marsalis Jr.,” son Branford Marsalis said in a statement, saying his father was admitted to hospital on Saturday and “died peacefully this evening”.
“My dad was a giant of a musician and teacher, but an even greater father. He poured everything he had into making us the best of what we could be,” said Branford of the patriarch of New Orleans’ great musical family. 
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell marked Marsalis’ death with a statement posted on Twitter. 
“Ellis Marsalis was a legend. He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz. The love and the prayers of all of our people go out to his family, and to all of those whose lives he touched,” Cantrell wrote.
Marsalis was a New Orleans legend who had ended a three-decade run at New Orleans’ Snug Harbor on Frenchman Street in January. 
Marsalis told the club’s proprietor late last year it had become too exhausting to play his two 75-minute sets every Friday evening at the club.
As for his family, four of Marsalis’ six sons are musicians: Wynton, a nine-time Grammy-winning trumpeter and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York; Branford, a saxophonist and musical director of the “Tonight Show With Jay Leno” in the 1990s; Delfeayo, a trombonist; and Jason, a drummer.",entertainment
Spotify India and Warner Music Group renew global licensing deal ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/spotify-india-and-warner-music-group-renew-global-licensing-deal/article31234122.ece,"Months after signing a licensing agreement with Warner Chappell, Spotify India has finally renewed its global licensing agreement with the record label giant Warner Music Group, the streaming platform announced in a statement on April 1, 2020. 
Spotify which launched in Sweden in 2008, made its foray into the Indian market on February 26, 2019. Though it quickly became popular for its AI-powered playlist curation, based on the user’s inclinations to artistes, moods, genres and era, the variety of music available was lacking due to the long-ongoing legal dispute with Warner Music Group (WMG). This started when Warner Music, which was was an investor in Spotify, sold its stake in the streaming service in August 2018. 
Then in February 2019, Warner had requested the Bombay High Court for an injunction to prevent Spotify from offering songs by its roster of song writers, including Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran, Madonna and David Guetta — some of the music has already been released to the platform, but Spotify confirms the complete rollout with take a couple of days. Warner Chappell, the publishing arm for the WMG, represents songwriters, while record labels work with the recording artist and producer. 
This deal will finally bring Spotify up the ranks in terms of library diversity, a decision which could not have come at a better time with the ongoing Coronavius lockdown. Existing major competitors in the Indian market include JioSaavn, Gaana, Apple Music, YouTube Music and Google Play Music. 
Once the global license was renewed by the two companies, a joint statement from Spotify and Warner Music Group reads, “Spotify and Warner Music Group are pleased to announce a renewed global licensing partnership. This expanded deal covers countries where Spotify is available today, as well as additional markets. The two companies look forward to collaborating on impactful global initiatives for Warner artists and songwriters, and working together to grow the music industry over the long term.” No financial details about the WMG-Spotify deal have been disseminated.
According to Spotify, the company’s total revenue for Q4 2019 was €1,855 million, representing growth of 24% year-over-year, in line with expectations; of this, premium revenue was €1,638 million of the total and grew 24% year-over-year, also in line with expectations. With 124 million premium subscribers globally, which is the highest net add quarter Spotify has experienced and the fastest they have ever added 10 million subscribers.",entertainment
COVID-19: How this Kerala home guard reaches out to ‘guest workers’ and wins hearts ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-this-kerala-home-guard-reaches-out-to-guest-workers-and-wins-hearts/article31237911.ece,"K Karunakaran, a home guard in Kozhikode, became a social media sensation after a video of him conversing in Hindi with workers from outside Kerala went viral on Sunday (March 30). The clip shows him explaining what COVID-19 is all about and how one has to stay safe while the group of workers in Meypayyur, about 40 km from Kozhikode, listens attentively. Answering their questions patiently, Karunakaran tells them why they have to stay put in Kerala for the time being and how the government would ensure that they get food, water and shelter. His demeanour, communication skills and sincerity have been winning the 55-year-old accolades from all quarters.
The Ernakulam District Collector, Suhas S, shared the video on his Facebook page and added that words would not be enough to thank people like him. The video on his page has been viewed 2,13,000 times and shared by thousands. The Collector exhorts guest workers to listen to the video and ends the short note with ‘Big salute sir’.
“It was the Kozhikode Rural SP, Dr Srinivas A, who wanted home guards who spoke Hindi to get in touch with the workers staying in camps in Kozhikode district. He wanted us to find out if they had any problem that needed to be resolved by the administration. So, Ashraf Chirakkara, a civil police officer under the Janamaitri scheme, and I were assigned for the job. Now, I am with civil police officer Riyaz Ahmed. For the last four days, we have been reaching out to them and reassuring them, giving them my mobile number and telling them to get in touch with me for any problem they face,” he says over phone. 
 




 
After ‘guest workers’, as Chief Minister Pinararyi Vijayan calls migrant workers, in Paippad in Kottayam district hit the streets on Sunday, demanding better facilities and that they be sent to their respective States, the Kerala government stepped up efforts to ensure that the workers’ needs were taken care of.
“On Sunday, I contacted the home guards and directed them to send Hindi-speaking people to be in touch with the workers in 64 camps in rural Kozhikode. Each camp has at least 50 men living there. We could keep an eye on them and see that their basic needs were met. We are talking to contractors who employ them to see that they receive their wages and to house owners to waive the rent for a month. Impressed by Karunakaran’s work, I have made him the mascot of Kozhikode Rural for guest workers and he will be the pointsperson for all of them coming under our jurisdiction,” explains Dr Srinivas.
Karunakaran says his duty is assisting in communicating with the workers. “On Sunday, we covered seven camps and the eighth one was at Meypayyur. By then, we were really tired and had already spoken to more than 400 labourers. All of them were anxious to know when they would be able to go home since the entire country was under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 spread. I pacified them, talked to them about the Coronavirus and told them about the necessity of a lockdown. It was there that Ashraf shot the video that went viral. That was incidental. I am still on my work that has been given to us by Meypayyur CI Anoop G,” he says.
Brothers allDr Srinivas A, Kozhikode Rural SP, says the Rural Police has begun a scheme called ‘Apna Bhai, wherein a box has been kept in all ration shops and provision stores. So those buying their grocery can also buy something for the ‘Apna Bhai’ box. Every evening, the contents of the box are distributed among the guest workers who need it the most.”
“We are in the process of delivering rations to workers from other States living in camps that come under the Meypayyur police station under the leadership of the Kozhukallur Village Officer, Kozhikode. We begin at 8 am and go on till the work assigned to us is over,” says Karunakaran. 
Karunakaran retired as Naik from the EMC, Kar Sena rank in 2006. His last posting was at Jodhpur. He is a resident of Perambra, Kozhikode. In 2009, he joined the home guard and had worked as a volunteer during the floods in Kerala in 2019 and 2018.",society
This apartment in Bengaluru is distributing groceries to daily wage earners ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/an-apartment-in-bengaluru-is-distributing-groceries-to-daily-wage-earners/article31237291.ece,"
As the heart-wrenching news of migrant labourers walking thousands of kilometres to return home poured in following the announcement of countrywide lock-down on March 24, Bengaluru-based author and entrepreneur Sudipto Das, his neighbours and batch mates from IIT Kharagpur, discussed how they could make a difference within their locality itself. “Our apartment is on Sarjapur Road. We pondered over how we could help so many people stranded in the lock-down. Images of people trekking hundreds of kilometres, abandoning the cities they no longer could call home, carrying little babies in their arms — babies who might not even survive the ordeal — drove us crazy. There had to be a solution.”.”
 After some introspection and brainstorming, they analysed the root cause for the exodus. Says Sudipto: “It is caused because, suddenly, with no cash in hand, millions of daily wage earners staying away from home were feeling alienated and helpless, with no one to share their pain and uncertainty about the immediate future. Under such circumstances, it is but natural to yearn for their families back home.”







Sudipto adds there were two problems they needed to tackle, one of hunger and the other of the rapid spread of the coronavirus through mass movement. “With hunger being the root cause, what comes to mind is the need to feed the hungry. In such a scenario, central kitchens and arrangements for massive food distribution might look logical. Even, for the sake of argument, if we assume that million people could be picked up from their homes during the lock-down, taken to the central kitchens, fed, and then again dropped back home, all the time maintaining social distancing, and all the known standards of hygiene, it is not feasible to prepare so much food on a daily basis.”
 After exploring his neighbourhood and from his findings, Sudipto adds that most of daily wage earners already have cooking arrangements, wherever they have been staying. All they need is supplies from their grocers, who they have been going to all these days and who give them their daily provisions on credit. “We can’t blame the local grocers, who are more often than not, people of meagre means themselves and have concerns for unrecoverable debts. That is when an idea flashed through our minds. We thought of breaking down the macro problem of millions people at the city level into the hyper-micro problems of only a few hundred in each neighbourhood. Looking around in our own neighbourhood we figured out that we could very well pool in some money and pay the local grocery stores for the daily provisions of the people who are stranded here. We talked to the people about their basic requirements, negotiated a good rate with the grocer and come up with a unit containing basic provisions to sustain a family of four to five people, including children for two days. We then requested one person from each family to collect the packet directly from the shop. This served several purposes. It ensured that no one had to travel beyond a few hundred meters, thus not violating the norms of the lock-down or social distancing. We didn't have to bother about the logistics at all, thus making the entire process very simple; it ensured that there were no middlemen and that the packets directly reached the ones they were meant for; and finally, it ensured that there would not be any wastage, as we had given a limited quantity.”







The packets comprise two kilograms of rice, half a kilogram each of dal, potato and onion, half a litre of cooking oil, a packet of biscuits, some green chillies and one soap. “After some negotiation, the grocer was ready to give it for ₹250.”
On how they identified the people in need, Sudipto says: “They stay in our neighbourhood. Each of us went around and identified stranded people, within few hundred meters of our homes, while going out to buy groceries, talked to them, authenticated, verified that the needs are genuine, talked to the same grocers they have been buying stuff from all these days, paid for the number of packets they would need, and asked one member per family to go to the shop and collect the packet.”
As of today they have self delivered packets to 377 people in Sarjapur Road. “By self delivered I mean the labourers collected from the nearby stores and we just paid the respective grocers,” says Sudipto.
Gobind Sharma, a labourer, says they are receiving the unit packets. “Four or five of us live together in Dasarahalli and so we are able to share the food among us. The stores get replenished but if we can get a little more rice, it would be good.” 35-year-old Jayaram M, an advocate, who stays in Sarjapur, says: “I do a round of the locality to see if people are in need. And then I update Sudipto. We don’t always get every item from one shop, we have to source different items from different shops.” Likkhu, a security guard says: “These packets help sustain us. Our homes are far in UP and Bihar.”
This simple model, which can be replicated by anyone in their locality, has got others interested too. “You don’t need to go out regularly, just on a day when you go out to buy groceries, look around and you will surely see people stranded. Identify them, talk to the grocer and ask the fund manager to pay the grocer and within 10 minutes the people get their necessities.” Sudipto received calls from people across the city. “Someone called from KR Puram and organised groceries for 65 people there. We paid from our funds for two clusters stranded at Bannerghatta Road and Dasarahalli, based on someone who personally identified the people.”
“The idea is to stay at home, respect the lockdown but still do whatever we can at a micro level to minimises the movement of people. Our target is to reach 500.” For details email: sudipto@sudiptodas.com. ",society
Saturday night party scenes under the coronavirus lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/app-hopping-using-quarantinechat-rave-zoom-house-party/article31236767.ece,"“Hi, where are you from?” A man breathes into my ear. But he isn’t talking to me, he is talking to another woman on this public group chat that I have entered on Rave. It is a multimedia messenger app that allows users to watch videos in sync, while also texting and speaking via VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). 
“Argentina,” the woman breathes back while 14 of us are trying to watch Annabelle: Creation  on Netflix. My phone pings, announcing that standup comic Aaquib Jaleel is live with House of T, hosting a quiz on Instagram. I discreetly leave the ASMR conversation at Rave to wash my ears and switch to the ‘Gram.
Weekend pub-hopping has never really been my scene. But given that the world is currently practising physical distancing, the desperation for friends, acquaintances, or strangers to fill the silences in our homes is reaching a crescendo.
So, pub-hopping has today mutated into app-hopping. And that is something I can get behind. I’ve been cruising the dirty lanes of Craigslist since I was 17.
***
The Instagram live quiz is going well: I learnt that Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is the first feature length animation, and Leo Fender, inventor of Fender guitars, couldn’t actually play one. 
Unexpectedly though, I get a call via the Dialup app, from QuarantineChat. This app arbitrarily connects you to any of its over-1,000 users across the globe. That is how I met Andrei, a Romanian warehouse worker who has been living near Yorkshire, UK, for the past three years.
We take five minutes to adjust to each others’ accents, but in the next 30 minutes, the 49-year-old describes his life in Yorkshire, how he met his wife, and why he loves that she is as good at fixing things as he is. I tell him about all the cats and dogs I’ve known and how my parents live up in the hills, while I’m spending my years near the sea. “If I could give my 20-year-old self some advice, I’d tell him to live without fear, without worrying about what other people think of you,” he says in his gruff, slow voice. 
I am reminded of what Nishad, a 25-year-old from Mumbai I met through QuarantineChat, had told me about his experience speaking to a woman in her fifties, “There was so much warmth in her voice. You know she didn’t spend her time texting people on screens, like people of our generation.”
***
I can’t dwell too much on philosophical discussions, however. Because I am super popular, I have a House Party scheduled in half an hour, and I have to slap on some lipstick for it. This is one of the precious few times I (virtually) meet fellow humans, and I’m not doing it in pyjamas. Not even if it is to play yet another game while facetiming with five buddies. We can get competitive.
I consider heading back to Rave after the House Party. But the scene there is dead: the Shrek watch party speaks a different language, with zero Eddie Murphy references, and the only person talking to me is a certain Diego asking if I’m on Snapchat. 
Instead, I convince one of my friends to download Squad. I’m constantly on the lookout for new places to meet the same eight friends I have, and this particular app allows screen sharing. Which means no more screenshots, you can spill tea in real time as your friend’s screen movements and videos come alive in your’s.
Mind you, downloading these apps, including House Party and Zoom, among others, means giving over a whole lot of personal information to third parties. So you might want to rethink who’s really spilling the tea here.
The moon is rising, and I open up a bottle of wine to drink with my college friends living in Italy, US and Germany, over Google Hangouts. We might dim the lights and turn it into a dance party; we have already made a joint Spotify playlist. ‘It’s Saturday night and we in the spot’ — same spot as we have been for the past 10 days.
I need to sleep soon though, I have RSVP’d “yes” to a Brooklyn 99 Netflix Party with my sister for brunch. ",society
"Rating downgrades outpace upgrades, says Crisil",https://www.thehindu.com/business/rating-downgrades-outpace-upgrades-says-crisil/article31241423.ece,"The impact of a slowing economy has started reflecting in rating actions with downgrades (469) outnumbering upgrades (360) in the second half of fiscal 2020, rating agency Crisil said on Thursday.
As a result, the credit ratio has dropped to 0.77 times compared with 1.21 times in the first half. A ratio below one indicates more downgrades than upgrades.
Over the near to medium term, credit quality trends would be driven by the ability of companies to rebound from the near-standstill demand situation, it said,
“We foresee India Inc’s credit quality deteriorating in the near-term. Our study of 35 sectors, both from manufacturing and services, however, shows sharp variation in resilience in a post-Covid-19 landscape,” Gurpreet Chhatwal, president, Crisil Ratings, said.
On non-banking finance firms, Crisil said the liabilities side could pose challenges for companies with high share of capital market borrowings. 
This is because no moratorium has been announced so far for capital market borrowings (such as bonds and commercial paper) and repayments on these will have to be made on time, during a period when collections would be impacted significantly.
Separately, Moody’s Investors Service has changed the country’s banking sector outlook to ‘negative’ as the virus outbreak and bank default prospects add to risks.
 “A sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment will lead to a deterioration of household and corporate finances, which will result in increases in delinquencies,” it said.",business
TV viewership up 37% in first week of lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tv-viewership-up-37-in-first-week-of-lockdown/article31241371.ece," Television viewership has seen a sharp increase of 37% from March 21 to 27 as compared to the pre-lockdown period from January 11 to 31. 
The TV consumption data for the first week of the lockdown was released by BARC India-Nielsen on Thursday.
The sharp increase is on account of people staying at home during the lockdown and watching news and movies, as per the findings.
This period witnessed the highest-ever TV viewing at 1.20 trillion minutes. And 622 million new viewers were found watching TV for 4 hours 40 minutes daily. 
While news saw a growth of 298%, business news grew 180% in viewership. Infotainment clocked a growth of 63%, while movies saw 56% growth in viewership. This is against the 3% growth in general entertainment content (GEC) viewing. 
“There has been a huge change in momentum. This is the good time for advertisers to build brands, especially food and beverage brands, on television,” said Sunil Lulla, CEO, BARC India. The week witnessed the return of the 1986 produced Ramayan, which garnered a viewership of 51 million on Saturday and Sunday. 
“The re-telecast of Ramayan garnered the highest ever rating to a Hindi GEC show since 2015,” he said.
These was also a significant rise in smartphone content consumption across geographies, socio-economic classes and age groups.",business
Movement of essential goods hit by disruptions,https://www.thehindu.com/business/movement-of-essential-goods-hit-by-disruptions/article31241198.ece,"With the country witnessing largescale disruptions in transportation network and supply chain on account of the COVID-19 spurred lockdown, the logistics sector is likely to face more hardships as current reserves are depleting and manufacturing is yet to pick up. 
“The situation does not seem to be improving. Demand for movement of essentials goods is increasing frantically, but supply is not even close to matching it,” said Abhishek Gupta, MD, Prakash Parcel Services Ltd.
“We are most likely entering a phase where supply will be disrupted very soon. Instructions from the Ministry of Home Affairs to allow trucks to operate has not percolated down yet in many places. Warehouses and factories, to unload trucks, have not been asked to open,” he said. “The driver count per 100 trucks is now below 15 as compared to 58 before the virus outbreak. Not more than 10% of trucks are running and drivers are finding ways to return home,” he said. 
“In the short term, there is significant disruption to supply of all essential commodities and medicines, visible from the depleting stocks at various shops across India,” said Pankaj Poddar, CEO, Cosmo Films, which supplies packaging materials to all top FMCG firms. “But there is always inventory lying at various stages, which is getting consumed. The government has allowed food processing and pharma firms to operate, though they, in turn, are dependent on their raw material and packaging material suppliers. Their suppliers too are dependent on their supply chain,” he said.
He said this entire supply chain is broken with shortage of labour, packing material and trucks, and that the Centre must react quickly to this situation. “Or else we may have serious supply shortages by the third or fourth week of April,” he added. Manufacturers, on the other hand, are waiting to see how things move forward. 
“The government is taking all the necessary steps to ensure they curb the widespread of this deadly virus. Once there are signs of a revival, companies should increase production and adopt an aggressive go to market strategy,” Amit Kumar, MD & CEO, Pratap Snacks, said.
“Though we are facing some loss in revenue in the current quarter, we have met our targets in this fiscal and are expecting double-digit growth which was our initial target for the fiscal,” he said.
Analysts said if the lockdown persists, the supply chain would be disrupted owing to low capacity utilisation due to lack of labour and restriction on people and material movement, running down of inventory and profiteering by unscrupulous firms and middlemen since they have the first-hand information on supplies. 
Rohit Chaturvedi, CEO, Transport Hub, an IOT-based logistics firm, said, “Even a temporary disruption may be amplified due to middlemen’s behaviour. To deal with this, the authorities must identify categories for which supply restriction may matter.” “They need to understand supply side constraints such as the number of days of inventory left , replenishment rate for essential and desirable goods,” he said.
He said the authorities have to deploy predictive analytics to forecast demand pattern in the current scenario and identify supply clusters to fulfil demand.
“They should connect consumers with producers directly with the help of technology and take help from e-commerce players like Amazon to understand the demand pattern and use their supply expertise,” he said. Some experts have called for the need of deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other technologies to deal with the situation. 
Raj Saxena, Founder & CEO, LogisticsNow said “Artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial to the next generation supply chains, integrating long haul to last mile capacities with product demand, supply and the markets seamlessly. AI enabled supply chains will also help in faster and better response to emergencies and pandemics, saving lives.”
In a report titled “The COVID-19 War: How India can win faster leveraging its supply chains and logistics?” LogisticsNow said under the current circumstances supply chains and manufacturing have to be supported to ensure optimized throughput while being in close sync with demand with joint effort from corporates and the concerned government departments.
“Inventories of essentials already in the chain need to be unlocked immediately so while manufacturing and transport (inter-State) get back on track, local inventories with distributors are made available to retailers as required,” the report said. As transport capacities have been disrupted by stranded trucks, there is likely to be a need for thousands of trained drivers to move essential supplies.
“Options, including the Army Supply Corps, the Railways, Concor, Freight Marketplaces and Freight Intelligence networks, along with large fleet owners / truckers who can provide transport capacity from long haul to last mile will enable an effective response,” it said. 
A quick way to build last-mile transport capacity would be to partner with e-commerce companies and online pharmacies, other online delivery players which have built distribution capacity and focus this entire capacity on distribution of essentials with curfew passes enabled by mobile technology, the report said.
It emphasised the need to build AI-powered Citizen Information Systems (CIS).
“We can learn from China’s use of multiple data sources to identify and pro-actively isolate touchpoints of infected patients. China used image recognition, data feeds from millions of cameras, social media feeds, online payment / transaction data powered by cohesive AI algorithms which helped identify individuals and communities most at risk, to direct the containment efforts in this fast spreading pandemic,” the report said.

‘Lockdown to hit realty demand’,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lockdown-to-hit-realty-demand/article31241120.ece,"The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent country-wide lockdown will lead to a substantial drop in demand across real estate segments, including residential and commercial, in 2020, according to a new report by property consultant Anarock.
While housing sales are expected to witness a decline of 25%-25% from about 2.61 lakh units across top seven cities last year to 1.70 lakh-1.96 lakh units this year, net office absorption could fall 13%-30% to 28-35 million sq. ft. from 40 million sq.ft. in 2019, and the net leasing in the retail sector is estimated to drop 49%-64% to 3.1-4.3 million sq.ft. from 8.5 million sq.ft. during the period under review.
“[The] country-wide lockdown until mid-April has halted all activities. As evident, project sites are shut, site visits have stopped, and construction activity has come to a grinding halt, eventually impacting housing sales. Also, developers have deferred their new project launches for an unknown period,” the report said, noting that the commercial real estate is also not immune to the COVID-19 fallout.
“Corporate occupiers are seen delaying their leasing decisions and still several MNCs and businesses are testing new waters of the work-from-home option. If proved successful, it could impact leasing activities in the future,” it said, adding that the retail businesses that are highly dependent on consumer spending are also witnessing a momentary slowdown and reduced interest from global brands who may now consider revising their expansion plans.
In the residential sector, the report expects unsold inventory across the top seven cities of India to remain largely stable with a single-digit annual decline of around 1%-3% amid restricted supply and marginally improving demand. There has been a decline in unsold inventory over the past couple, falling 7% in 2018 and 4% in 2019. “With new launches coming to a screeching halt at least for the next few months until we see COVID-19 containment in the country, homebuyers may spring into action during the second half and select from the existing unsold inventory from projects across various stages of construction,” it said.
The affordable housing segment, which gained significant traction over the last few years, may also take a hit by COVID-19. The outbreak will significantly affect affordable housing’s target audience, the report said, adding that with limited income and unemployment fears, buyers of affordable housing may defer purchase decisions, leading to an estimated 1%-2% rise in unsold stock within this segment in 2020.
Anuj Puri, chairman - Anarock Property Consultants said, “Besides demand-supply decline in 2020, significant new trends will emerge across segments of Indian real estate. COVID-19 has derailed the office segment’s growth trajectory of the last three years. New business models will be tried making players more reliant on technology for ensuring business continuity. Besides revisiting office requirements, corporates will keep employee health and hygiene of assets as the topmost priority.”
Mr. Puri added that in the Indian retail, the revenue-sharing model would become even more dominant and retailers would prefer to partner with mall owners to mitigate risks arising from declining footfalls amid such unprecedented crises.",business

"Motor third party, health renewal dates extended",https://www.thehindu.com/business/motor-third-party-health-renewal-dates-extended/article31240897.ece,"Motor third party insurance and health insurance policies whose renewal date falls during the lockdown period (March 25 to April 14) can be renewed till April 21. 
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) shared the details of a notification issued in this regard by the Department of Financial Services with insurers. The regulator said the Centre had permitted motor vehicle TP and health insurance policyholders, whose policies fall due for renewal during the 21 days to make premium payment by April 21. 
The relaxation is for those who are unable to make payment towards the renewal in view of the situation as a result of COVID 19. “Insurers shall ensure adequate arrangements are made for ease of payment of premium by policyholders during the week following the end of the lockdown period (the last date being April 21),” IRDAI said. 
The regulator said such policyholders would be required to pay the renewal premium for the entire period of 12 months from the date it was due, by April 21. It directed the insurers to communicate details to the policyholders concerned “immediately, in a manner that is correctly understood by them” as well as inform agents and intermediaries. 
When the policy is issued, on receipt of the premium before April 21, “it shall be ensured that the period of cover commences from the date the renewal was due without any break in the policy period.”
Motor Business Head of Policybazaar.com Sajja Praveen Chowdary said the Finance Ministry notification is mainly for those who generally opt for Motor TP cover only and facing hardship on monetary or process front for now. The notification does not affect most of the private vehicles as most private vehicles have a comprehensive motor insurance policy that includes Own Damage cover also.

"Production of masks, coveralls see increase",https://www.thehindu.com/business/production-of-masks-coveralls-see-increase/article31240867.ece,"With the spread of COVID-19 in the country, demand for protective gear such as masks and coveralls has shot up. These products, now made by a handful of manufacturers, are attracting investments because of increasing demand.
According to government sources, the current production of N95 masks in the country is about 75,000 to one lakh pieces a day and coverall suits 5,000. 
The production of N95 and other types of similar versions of industrial masks was 10-15 lakh a month and it is now about 25 lakh a month (average). There are limitations in increasing production of these masks as the machinery needs to be imported. 
There are 16 main producers of coveralls at present. Some major suppliers are expected to get into production shortly for coveralls and its numbers will increase. Against an annual consumption of 50,000 body coveralls a month before the outbreak, now, the demand is projected at almost one lakh a day. It is estimated that production will scale up to 50,000 a day in May. 
Imports have started and more are in the pipeline and a clear position will be available by next week.
The Ministry of Textiles is taking steps to bring in new manufacturers and is facilitating logistics for supply of the gear. It is also co-ordinating with the State government authorities so that these industries have permission to operate and are able to transport goods, according to sources. These products are tested by South India Textile Research Association for standards.
S.K. Sundararaman, MD, Shiva Texyarn and chairman, Indian Technical Textile Association, said N95 masks, goggles, coveralls and gloves are the protective gear that the health workers mostly use. An approximate estimate of the requirement of coveralls is 20 lakh pieces. Some manufacturers now produce reusable coverall suits.
“The Class III coveralls recommended was not generally made in India. Now, even for those who are getting into it, there is shortage in availability of fabric and seam sealing facility. We (Shiva Texyarn) started making coveralls a week ago and produce 2,000 pieces a day. In the case of masks too, there were just five N 95 suppliers. The existing textile manufacturers are trying to get into these segments now. But, there are challenges such as availability of fabric,” he said.
State Governments are also coming out with alternative systems to ensure that health workers are protected.
The association is interacting constantly with the Ministry and giving data on the realistic production. More investments will certainly come in, he added.",business

“This decision was taken as approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for the transaction was not obtained within the anticipated timelines,” Aurobindo Pharma and Novartis said.
As part of the proposed transaction, for which a definitive agreement was announced in September 2018, Aurobindo was to acquire commercial operations and three manufacturing facilities in the U.S. from Sandoz Inc., a Novartis division.

Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have started intimating customers about loan repayment moratoriums, as directed by Reserve Bank of India due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Customers who have already paid their March 2020 instalments will not be able to avail moratorium for March 2020 but can do so for April and May 2020, it said.

It said Banks’ asset quality will deteriorate across the corporate, small and medium enterprises and retail segments, leading to pressure on profitability and capital.

“We have changed the outlook for the Indian banking system to negative from stable. Disruptions to economic activity from the coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate a slowdown in India’s economic growth,” Moody’s said.
Stating that asset quality will deteriorate, Moody’s said a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment will lead to a deterioration of household and corporate finances, which in turn will result in increases in delinquencies.
“Growing solvency stress among non-bank financial institutions will increase risks to banks’ asset quality because banks have large exposures to the sector,” it added.

It expects deteriorating profitability and loan growth to hurt capitalisation.
“Increases in loan loss charges and declines in revenue will hurt banks’ profitability, which will lead to a deterioration of capitalization. If the government makes more capital infusions into PSBs, as it has in the past few years, it will mitigate capital pressure for them,” it added.
It said while funding and liquidity at public sector banks (PSBs) will be stable, growing risk aversion in the system following a default by a private sector bank (Yes Bank) will increase funding and liquidity pressure on small private sector lenders.
“Disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate India’s economic slowdown. A deterioration of global economic conditions and a 21-day lockdown imposed by the Indian government in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus will weigh on domestic demand and private investment,” Moody’s added.

It has indeed affected the players, especially artistes and makers of soaps, in a big way. With restrictions on movement, content generation has hit a bottleneck and most of the channels have turned to old serials and films to keep the home-bound audience entertained. “Well, when the popular serial ‘Ramayan’ can be brought back, why can we not air some of our bring our old serials,” asks a channel head. Why not, indeed. If a channel has a bank of some 1,000 films, starring actors such as Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Vijay, Ajith Kumar, Suriya, Karthi and Vikram, it can telecast them until the crisis passes. Also excerpts in the form of song sequences and comedy scenes can be telecast too.
Another option is to switch to reality shows, shot earlier. News channels, however, have no problem with the situation providing copious content, repetitive though. The challenge before the staff of entertainment channels now is to dive into their archives and emerge with old ‘treasures,’ which mission has already started.
This is one serial, which is aired at 2.30 p.m. and again 10.30 p.m., Monday to Saturday. But it is not a repeat telecast of the same episode. The channel started its late evening telecast of ‘Magarasi,’ two weeks after its launch in the afternoon slot. So the episodes are different. A remake of the Telugu serial, ‘Kanulu Moosina Neevaye,’ it has some of the popular big screen faces too. One is Riyaz Khan and another is singer Deepan Chakravarthy. In the lockdown situation, with most of the soaps going off air, viewers can watch this serial at night. The day telecast stands suspended. It is informed that a bank of 20 episodes will keep ‘Magarasi’ going for some time.
This seems to be a good opportunity to turn the spotlight on Riyaz Khan. In the background is the interesting story of an artiste, who has aced both big and small screens. Taking his bow as a teenager, he has 300 films under his belt. “My first film was in Telugu, titled Madura Nagarilo. Around the same time, I I acted in Sukham Sukharam, a Malayalam film, directed by Balachandra Menon. Both were big hits. So I had a nice beginning and was eager to make my entry in Tamil cinema. But the problem was I was neither an adult nor a child star. Besides some of the big stars such as Sathyaraj, Prabhu and Karthik were ruling the roost. so had to wait for quite a while before the next opportunity came,” recalls Riyaz.

After a couple of years, he got the break through Athma, directed by Pratap Pothen for his producer brother. Riyaz was one of the heroes, along with Ramki and Rahman. Others in important roles were Nasser, Gouthmani, Kasthuri, Vinodhini, Vaani, Vijayakumari, Vijayachander and Senthil.
Television and soaps rose in importance, bringing entertainment to the drawing room. Several channels, including Sun TV, made the best use of the trend. Hindi star Jeethendra’s production house wanted to test the waters too and produced ‘Sakti,’ in which Riyaz played small role. This was followed by ‘Kudumbam,’ directed by K. Rangaraj, which was a hit. There was no looking back as Riyaz went on to star in ‘Chithi’ for Radhika’s production house and in ‘Marumagal’ for Kushboo. “I was one of the actors in ‘Annamalai,’ where Sivakumar did an important role too,” informs Riyaz.
Aamir impressed
Big screen beckoned and Riyaz acted in Badri, remake of the Telugu movie, which starred Pawan Kalyan. Aalavanthan with Kamal Haasan, Ramana under Murugadoss and a Kannada film with Puneeth Rajkumar happened at this point. His performance in Ghajini impressed Aamir Khan, who wanted Riyaz to repeat the role in the Hindi remake. Riyaz played villain in Balettan with Mohanlal. “
“When I was doing some of the memorable roles in films, my friend director Sunder C. asked me to do a transgender role in his serial, ‘Nandhini,’ which won me acclaim,” says Riyaz, who had become adept at toggling both small and big screens. “Right now, I’m working with director Mani Ratnam on Ponniyin Selvan in the role of Soman Sambavan, which requires me to be with a moustache and beard. Meanwhile, my friend, director Rajkumar wanted me to act in a serial “Magarasi.” He kindly adjusted the dates to accommodate me,” says Riyazh Khan, who has done 10 serials so far and also 10 telefilms.

Ever since the Coronavirus outbreak, there have been scores of comfort movie listings and recommendations. Of course, you can use this quarantine time to watch or revisit some of your favourite movies — whether it is Hollywood or regional. But there are also many international films that you can catch up on OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Here are some suggestions:







This is on the top of this list just so that I grab the attention of the masses — like the way the Academy Awards did. The world suddenly woke up to international cinema when Parasite became the first South Korean movie to take home the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Since then, Bong Joon-ho has become the messiah to the urban middle class. Anyway, Parasite can be seen as a spiritual successor to Bong Joon-ho’s Snowpiercer, a blazing action drama whose political layers seemed to have lost under Tilda Swinton’s strangely-funny woollen robe. But Parasite is probably the better movie.
Yes, it is primal and primitive. Yes, it is a genre-bending movie. Yes, the title is an allegory. Yes, it presents a superb argument against the class system. Yes, it is neatly structured. Yes, it has terrific performances. Yes, Park So-dam (the actor who plays Kim’s daughter) is cute. Yes, it needed internationalism for it to win the Best Picture Award at the Academy Awards. Above all, it is wildly entertaining.

It is a crime if you haven’t watched Hirokazu Kore-eda’s heart-rending drama, wherein he destroys the ideals of what constitutes a ‘family’ in the first half. Known for his penchant for writing family dramas, Shoplifters could be argued as Kore-eda’s best work till date. It follows the story of an impoverished family that survives by shoplifting. In Parasite, a character remarks: “You cannot choose your family, can you?” But this is what Kore-eda does in Shoplifters. A motley group of characters reside in a suitcase-size house, hiding under the blanket of a dysfunctional ‘family’. But none of them are related but are united by poverty. The movie has several little gems and it is better I don’t spoil them for you. In a way, both Shoplifters and Parasite are distant cousins, for they fight a common enemy: capitalism.

Hungarian filmmaker Ildikó Enyedi decided to meditate on a piece of paper and the result was a quiet, meditative exploration of body and soul. It is a slightly arty movie and the narrative is painstakingly slow. But if you manage to sit through the first 20 minutes, you will discover a wonderful piece of art that leaves you with a sense of metaphysical experience. On Body and Soul deals with two workers who discover that they share a common dream, drawing them closer in real life. They get visibly awkward around each other in real life, but somehow forge a strong connection in their dream, wherein they see themselves as a pair of deer. The deer is used as a powerful metaphorical tool to depict their psychological conditions. Ildikó Enyedi treats the characters with remarkable tenderness and what we got was a gentle and moving love story.

Atlantics is a quiet movie but makes a rousing political statement. On the surface, it might look like a regular romantic tale of separation between two lovers, Souleiman and Ada, both belonging to lower strata of society. Ada’s parents want her married to Omar, an affluent in the region. Souleiman’s job forces him to leave the country by sea and he promises to return before Ada’s marriage. Due to the unfortunate turn of events, Souleiman and his fellow migrant workers never see the land again while the women wait for them with bated breath. There is a strong sense of magical realism in Mati Diop’s storytelling. Diop’s storytelling offers plenty of scope for magical realism. For, the men return in the form of supernatural beings, to deliver a larger point on class politics and migrant labour. The film’s breath-taking cinematography, which includes beautiful and poignant shots of ocean, empty buildings, streets, addweight to the narrative.

Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, which was nominated for the Academy Awards for various categories, showed a couple in a disintegrating marriage. Marriage Story was still a soft take and focused primarily on the cruelty of the legal system. Baumbach painted his characters with an air of dignity, sometimes making you question if they were designed for an ideal world. Which is why Russian film Loveless seems more natural, more raw and close to reality, and is an excellent companion piece to Marriage Story. Andrey Zvyagintsev’s screenplay eschews vanilla-ness and shows no mercy in treating his characters with shades of black. Like its title, the movie offers a terrifying commentary on the loveless nature of a couple seeking for divorce. They spit on each other’s mugs (not literally, but you get it, right?) and want each other dead. It is usually the child who bears the brunt of divorce, right? Here, it is their meek son whose silent cries aren’t paid heed to by either of the parents. If you like Loveless, do check out the director’s The Return.

It is sad that this terrific Uruguayan survival drama by Alvaro Brechner never got its due even in the international circuit. Based on the real life of the former Uruguay President Jose Mujica, the movie tracks the lives of three political prisoners during the country’s military dictatorship in the ‘70s. It examines the mind state of the prisoners, showing the extent of human resilience under dark times. In a way, A Twelve-Year Night is both Shawshank Redemption and The Count of Monte Cristo in terms of its treatment. I caught this at the Chennai International Film Festival (2018) and it was a visceral experience to say the least, especially for its last hour. If you are planning to watch A Twelve-Year Night, I suggest you finish it in one sitting since it is not a leisure watch.

If you are looking for something less ‘serious’ and want to have fun, then do watch the Norweigan movie Thelma. At the outset, it is about Thelma and the feelings she develops with her friend. Having lived all her life with her parents, who are practising Christians, Thelma moves to Oslo for her graduation programme. She finds herself isolated from the rest for the most part and discovers psychokinetic powers when she falls for her friend, a woman, in college. To an extent that every time she tries to get physical with her friend, she begins to have seizures, writhes in pain and gets tormented by random, disorienting images. Does this have to do with her childhood? Does it have to do with religion? Thelma is as much a thriller as it is a horror. And I assure you, it will take you on a ‘writhing’ experience.

This is my least favourite in Bong Joon-ho’s oeuvre starting with the procedural investigative thriller, Memories of Murder. Nevertheless, Okja is a cute movie that is also stunningly shot. Okja is the name of an animal, which looks like a cross-bred between an elephant and a pig, raised and sheltered by a young girl Mija in South Korea. The plot begins to heat up when Okja lands up in the laboratory of a corporate giant, where the animal is bred with another pig. What starts as a heart-warming drama turns into a mockumentary, espousing the ugly sides of animal cruelty. Packed by a powerhouse of talent, Okja makes a case for a light-hearted adventure movie and not to be taken seriously.

It is a good entry point to South Korean movies and its filmmaker Yeon Sang-ho’s wild and absurd — both in a good way — brand of cinema. There have been countless zombie movies both inside and outside of South Korea, but Train to Busan was a revelation because of the way it reinvents the tropes associated with this genre. The premise is quite simple: a father and his daughter board a train to Busan to spend the latter’s birthday with his estranged wife. But soon, they realise there is a zombie invasion. The movie takes a leaf out of Bong Joon-ho’s first English movie Snowpiercer. For, the entire drama takes inside a moving train. Train to Busan, in other words, is madly entertaining.

There has been a lot written about Alfonso Cuaron’s deeply personal family drama, a semi biographical portrait of his own upbringing in the ‘70s in Mexico. Roma leaves you with a mix bag of emotions; it is both tragedy and comedy in parts. There were some criticisms upon its release for the black-and-white effect. Alfonso Cuaron later gave an interview on why he was specific about the monochromatic tone of the movie. “I wanted to do a modern film that looks into the past,” Cuaron was quoted as saying by The Guardian. The cinematography (by Alfonso Cuaron) is stunning and offers rich textural details that otherwise might have been missed in colour. All of which is to say that you have to watch Roma. If it helps, the movie won three Academy Awards in 2019.

"‘The Two Popes’ to ‘A Twelve-Year Night’, here are filmmaker Chezhiyan’s recommendations",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chezhiyans-movie-recommendations/article31236487.ece,"Like its title, the movie is about the conflict between two popes, who are separated by ideologies. One is too conservative and the other is liberal. There are implications on the politics of Vatican City. But the movie is visually beautiful even though it is dialogue-heavy. The director Fernando Meirelles has done a fantastic job in retaining the emotional core of the movie. 

I loved this movie and was reminded of Vaikom Muhammad Basheer’s Mathilukal novel. A Twelve-Year Night is both political and a survival drama. What was striking for me was the way sound was used as a character. It is based on the real-life story of the former Uruguayan President Jose Mujica. 

The show is about reputed designers from all over the world. It offers a peek into the life of designers and their design concepts. For example, there is an episode about how the Instagram logo was designed. It is very interesting and I would strongly suggest this. I am also using this time to revisit Breaking Bad. 

I really liked Tales by Light, which is an insight into the world of photography. The series follows the life of sought-after photographers from Australia and the other countries. It is pensive and beautifully-shot. Wild Wild Country is another TV show I would recommend.

 The Oscar winner’s appeal comes after Tabligh-e-Jamaat’s Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin West emerged as an epicentre for spread of COVID-19 in different parts of the country after thousands of people took part in a congregation from March 1-15.
 In a lengthy statement on Twitter, Rahman on Wednesday asked people to be “kind and thoughtful”.
“God is inside your heart (the most sacred shrine), so this is not the time to cause chaos by congregating in religious places. Listen to the government’s advice. Self-isolation for a few weeks may give you many more years,” he posted.
“Do not spread the virus and cause harm to fellow humans. This disease does not even warn you that you are a carrier, so don’t assume you are not infected. This is not the time to spread false rumours and cause more anxiety and panic,” he wrote.
 Rahman also thanked the healthcare workers on the frontlines, battling the pandemic in order to save several lives in the country.
“This message is to thank the doctors, nurses, and all the staff working, in hospitals and clinics all across India, for their bravery and selflessness. It fills one’s heart to see how ready they are to deal with this most dreadful pandemic. They risk their lives to save ours,” the 53-year-old composer said.

‘Mafia: Chapter 1’: Toronto serial killer’s victims’ photos used in Tamil movie to depict criminals ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mafia-chapter-1-toronto-serial-killers-victims-photos-used-in-tamil-movie-to-depict-criminals/article31234196.ece,"Lyca Productions, the makers of recently-released Tamil film Mafia: Chapter 1 starring the likes of Arun Vijay, Prasanna and Priya Bhavani Shankar, find themselves in the middle of a heated controversy as it has emerged that the film used mug-shot photos of five of the eight men murdered by Canadian serial killer Bruce McArthur, in a pivotal scene.
Directed by Karthick Naren, the scene appears around 39 minutes into the movie, when the photos are stuck, along with those of many other criminals, on a police investigation board, as two cops discuss the operation. The photos are meant to indicate men who have connections to a drug kingpin, as per the narrative in the film.






The scene in ‘Mafia’ during which the victims’ photos are used on a police board
 






According to a report in CBC News, the photos used are of Skandaraj Navaratnam, Selim Esen, Abdulbasir Faizi, Kirushna Kanagaratnam and Soroush Mahmudi: all victims of the serial killer, whose images were circulated by the media and police at the time of the incident in Canada.
In 2019, Bruce McArthur, a landscaper in Toronto, pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of eight missing men, who had all been killed between 2010 and 2017. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.
It is unclear how exactly the makers of the film decided to choose these photos of deceased men to portray criminals in the film, but the massive faux pas was spotted after Mafia: Chapter 1 was made available to watch on Amazon Prime in many countries recently, including India and Canada.

India’s manufacturing activity weakens in March: PMI ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-manufacturing-activity-weakens-in-march-pmi/article31234362.ece," The country’s manufacturing sector activity grew at the slowest rate in four months during March, hampered by softer rises in new business as international demand faltered owing to the coronavirus pandemic, a monthly survey said on Thursday.
 The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI fell to 51.8 in March, from 54.5 in February, signalling the slowest improvement in business conditions since November 2019.
 This is the 32nd consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark.
 In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.
“The Indian manufacturing sector remained relatively sheltered from the negative impact of the global coronavirus outbreak in March, however, there were pockets of disruption and a clear onset of fear amongst firms,” Eliot Kerr, economist at IHS Markit, said.
 Moreover, the confidence towards the business outlook plummeted to a record low, with positivity tapered by COVID-19 concerns, the survey said.
“Should the trajectory of injections continue in the same vein, the Indian manufacturing sector can expect a much sharper negative impact in the coming months, similar to the scale seen in other countries,” Kerr said.
 According to the survey, the sentiment towards the 12-month business outlook weakened in March. Some panelists said there are fears of prolonged shutdowns due to COVID-19 and the associated negative impact on demand.
 Commenting on the latest India survey results, Kerr said new orders and output both grew at softer rates, but those readings were relatively tame compared to those seen at goods producers in Europe and other parts of Asia.
“The most prominent signs of trouble came from the new export orders and future activity indices, which respectively indicated tumbling global demand and softening domestic confidence,” Kerr noted.
 New orders placed with Indian manufacturers rose at a slower pace in March, while, new export business fell sharply.
“In fact, the decline in international sales was the fastest since September 2013 amid widespread lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the survey noted.
 The number of deaths around the world linked to the new coronavirus has crossed 47,000. In India, nearly 2,000 coronavirus cases have been reported so far.",economy

In a statement issued to the stock exchanges late on Wednesday, IndiaNivesh said its broking subsidiary, which has been in business for more than 14 years, is unable to raise funds due to the credit freeze and hence it has decide to voluntary disable it’s stock broking operations.
“... the ongoing global pandemic called the novel coronavirus [COVID-19] has led to an unprecedented fall in the markets coupled with the present lockdown. This has brought economic activity to a grinding halt.

Antarctica was home to rainforests 90 million years ago: Study ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/antarctica-was-home-to-rainforests-90-million-years-ago-study/article31234045.ece," Researchers have unearthed evidence of rainforests near the South Pole 90 million years ago, a finding which suggests that the climate at this time was exceptionally warm with a higher level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than previously thought.
 The scientists, including those from Imperial College London in the UK, discovered forest soil pertaining to a time between 145 and 66 million years ago within 900 kilometres of the South Pole. 
 In the study, published in the journal Nature, they analysed preserved roots, pollen, and spores from this soil, and showed that the world at that time — the Cretaceous period —was a lot warmer than previously thought.
 “The preservation of this 90-million-year-old forest is exceptional, but even more surprising is the world it reveals,” said study co-author Tina van de Flierdt from Imperial College London. 
 “Even during months of darkness, swampy temperate rainforests were able to grow close to the South Pole, revealing an even warmer climate than we expected,” van de Flierdt said. 
 According to the study, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were higher than expected during the mid-Cretaceous period, 115-80 million years ago, challenging current climate models of the period.
 The mid-Cretaceous was the heyday of the dinosaurs but was also the warmest period in the past 140 million years, with temperatures in the tropics as high as 35 degrees Celsius, and sea level 170 metres higher than today, the scientists said.
 However, they said, very little is known about the environment south of the Antarctic Circle at this time. 
 The scientists compared the current evidence of a temperate rainforest in the region to what is found in New Zealand today. 
 They said the finding is even more significant considering that the South Pole experiences only a four-month polar night, meaning for a third of every year there is no life-giving sunlight at all.
 According to the researchers, the presence of the forest suggests average temperatures in this region were around 12 degrees Celsius, with little likelihood for the presence of an ice cap at the South Pole at the time.
 The study noted that the evidence for the Antarctic forest is based on a core of sediment drilled into the seabed near the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica. 
 One section of the core, they said, caught their attention with its strange colour.
 On scanning this section with an X-ray CT scan, the scientists discovered a dense network of fossil roots, which was so well preserved that they could make out individual cell structures. 
 The samples noted in the study also contained countless traces of pollen and spores from plants, including the first remnants of flowering plants ever found at these high Antarctic latitudes.
 To reconstruct this ecology, the team assessed the climatic conditions under which the plants’ modern descendants live, as well as analysing temperature and rainfall indicators within the sample.
 They found that the annual mean air temperature was around 12 degrees Celsius. 
 Putting this in perspective, the researchers said this is roughly two degrees warmer than the mean temperature in modern-day Germany. 
 They believe the average summer temperatures may have been around 19 degrees Celsius and water temperatures in the rivers and swamps to be 20 degrees. According to the study, the amount and intensity of rainfall in West Antarctica at this time may have been similar to those in today’s Wales.
 The scientists concluded that about 90 million years ago the Antarctic continent may have been covered with dense vegetation, with no land-ice masses on the scale of an ice sheet in the South Pole region. 
 They believe the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was far higher than previously assumed for the Cretaceous period.
 “Before our study, the general assumption was that the global carbon dioxide concentration in the Cretaceous was roughly 1000 ppm,” said lead author Johann Klages from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. 
 “But in our model-based experiments, it took concentration levels of 1120 to 1680 ppm to reach the average temperatures back then in the Antarctic,” Klages said. PTI VIS VIS VIS 04021114 ",science

The researchers from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University found that nearly 81% (25 of 31) of patients in the treatment group showed improved pneumonia compared with the control group (55% or 17 of 31 patients). Only four of 62 patients progressed to severe illness and all the four were in the control arm. Two patients had mild adverse reaction (rash and headache) to the drug, while no severe side effects were seen.
Based on the recommendation of the Task Force for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on March 23, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis by healthcare workers taking care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases.

India is all set to join World Health Organisation’s multi-country “solidarity trial” aimed at testing four drug combinations, including chloroquine, to treat COVID-19. On March 29, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment.
Soon after U.S. President Donald Trump championed for hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, two Nigerians are reported to have over-dosed on the drug. A man in Arizona, U.S., died and his wife was hospitalised after they self-medicated with a home remedy of hydroxychloroquine. A doctor in India died after taking two doses of the drug.
Patients in the treatment arm received hydroxychloroquine 400 mg per day in addition to standard treatment for five consecutive days, while those in the control group received only the standard treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group.
The researchers looked for changes in the time taken for clinical recovery, which was defined as return to normal body temperature and cough relief for more than three days. They also looked for radiological changes using chest CT.
While 22 of 31 patients in the treatment group and 17 of 31 patients in the control group had a fever when the trial began, the time taken to achieve normal body temperature was “significantly shorter” for the treatment group, the preprint says. Also, cough remission was “significantly reduced” in the treatment group.

For Ashish, who booked an Olympic quota place at the Asia/Oceania qualifying event in Amman last month, watching Vijender box is a learning process. “I have never met Vijender bhai sahib, but I like his counterattacks and long-range game,” Ashish told The Hindu.
Ashish knows the importance of representing the country in the middleweight category, in which Indian boxers have given fine performances in the last three Olympics. Vijender bagged the bronze medal in 2008 and made it to the quarterfinals in 2012, Vikash Krishan, a World championships medallist, reached the last eight in 2016.
“My seniors have done well. Our middleweight boxers have set a high standard and I want to maintain this,” said Ashish, who has been fighting in this weight category since 2012.
Ashish, who claimed silver at the Asian championships and gold at the Thailand Open, gained his quota place after overcoming some tough times. “I sustained a leg injury. Then, I lost my father. I am happy that, despite this, I could bring cheer to my family with success at the Olympic qualifying event.
“My family, which has some boxers and wrestlers, always supported me. My brother Johnny Chaudhary, an international wrestler, has backed me right from the start.
“After my father’s death, he did not let me stay at home as the situation could have distracted me. He motivated me saying my father had always wanted me to compete in the Olympics and win a medal,” said Ashish.
Thanking JSW for its support, Ashish said, “When I badly needed a sponsor, they came forward.”
Having achieved his first target of qualifying for the Olympics, Ashish wants to make the most of the additional time following the postponement of the Tokyo Games. “I now have more time to make myself stronger and better prepared.”
In the time of lockdown, Ashish is doing his best to stay in touch with boxing. “We get inputs from our coaches through video conferencing. I stay indoors and do strength exercises and follow the training schedule given by the coaches,” said Ashish.",other sports
Ayushi steps it up in tough rifle event ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ayushi-steps-it-up-in-tough-rifle-event/article31251592.ece,"It is the toughest event in rifle and pistol. The rifle 3-position event demands 120 shots during qualification, 40 each in kneeling, prone and standing positions. Thereafter, it is a 45-shot final.
Unlike air events, in which youngsters shoot from 10 metres to strike world class scores very early in their career, the 50m event requires considerable experience and expertise.
Given this backdrop, the 19-year-old Ayushi Podder has done remarkably well to be among the six shortlisted for the Tokyo Olympics. Ayushi has had impressive scores of 1174 and 1168 in the Olympic trials.
From shooting 1121 in the junior section of the 2018 World championship in Korea, to scores of 1137 and 1154 in the junior World Cups in Suhl, Ayushi has come a long way in a short time.

“Ayushi is one of the most promising and consistent juniors,” says the high performance coach of the Indian rifle team, Olympian Deepali Deshpande.
Ayushi’s father Pankaj Podder, who works with the Railways, is himself a national-level shooter, and internationally qualified coach.
It was Pankaj who initiated Mehuli Ghosh, Commonwealth Games air rifle silver medallist, into shooting, along with his daughter, when he set up the Bull’s Eye Academy in 2014.
Having done well at the Khelo India Youth Games, Ayushi was recently inducted into TOPS and is part of the development group being groomed for the 2024 Games.

From Sachin Tendulkar stressing on the need to keep the vigil even after the lockdown ends on April 14, to sprinter Hima Das expressing sadness at the recent attacks on frontline warriors such as health care workers and police officers, to others sharing their experience of being in a lockdown, the sportspersons had lots to offer during the interaction. All these athletes have been generous donors to the funds being raised to fight the crisis.
The Prime Minister, on his part, sought their support to raise awareness about the need for social distancing and personal hygiene at a time when the total number of COVID-19 positive cases in India has crossed 2,000.

PM Modi to have video call with cricket icons, top Olympic sport athletes

“Your suggestions will be taken note of. We are fighting this pandemic like Team India. I am confident that India will be rejuvenated by the inspiration provided by you,” the Prime Minister can be seen telling athletes in a clip shared by shuttler B Sai Praneeth, a world championship bronze-medallist, who also attended the call.
All sporting activities are currently shut in the country and it is still not clear when normalcy will resume. The much-anticipated Indian Premier League is among the big-ticket Indian events suspended till April 15.
When Ganguly was asked about the development this morning, he said, “Yes, I will be joining our Honourable PM via video call.” But he refused to go into the details.
Cricketers formed a major chunk of the participating list.
Apart from Tendulkar, Ganguly and Kohli, others in the call included top batsman Rohit Sharma, former pacer Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh.
The names of World Cup-winning former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and K L Rahul were in the list of participants but it is learnt that they could not attend the call.
Olympic silver-medallist shuttler Sindhu, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, chess wizard Viswanathan Anand, sprinter Hima Das, boxing star Amit Panghal, wrestler Vinesh Phogat, and teenage shooting sensation Manu Bhaker were among the other accomplished athletes who took part in the video call.
“Of these, 12 have been given three minutes each to speak and present their view,” a ministry source told PTI without revealing the names of the chosen athletes.
It was later learnt that Tendulkar, Ganguly, M C Mary Kom and Kohli were among those who were to speak during the interaction.
“I suggested that as much as possible, I will use our way of greeting - saying ‘Namaste’ instead of shaking hands, even after we overcome this pandemic,” Tendulkar said after the interaction.
“I told him that it is sad that health care workers and police have been attacked,” said Asian Games medallist Hima Das, who is employed with Assam Police as a DSP.
However, six-time world champion Mary Kom could not connect to the call due to network issues.
Among those who managed to, former world champion weightlifter Mirabai Chanu said the PM urged everyone to be united in the fight to combat the pandemic.
“The PM asked us to spread awareness on social distancing and hygiene. He spoke about how we need Virat’s (Kohli) fighting spirit to win this battle,” added veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal.
World championship silver-winning shooter Abhishek Verma said the PM urged athletes “to be positive and spread positivity“.
“He said appreciate and highlight the work of frontline workers. Take good care of yourself and family at home. He asked us to e-mail any suggestions we have on how to handle the situation better,” Verma said.
The Prime Minister said the ability to face challenges, self-discipline, positivity and self-belief, which are essential to sports, are crucial tools to combat the spread of the virus as well.
Sporting action has come to a halt the world over with all major events either cancelled or postponed.
The list of postponed events includes the Tokyo Olympics and the European football championships, while among the biggest to be cancelled this year is the Wimbledon championship.
The deadly outbreak has caused more than 50 deaths in India. The global death toll has crossed 50,000.
Olympic-bound archer Deepika Kumari said the PM advised the athletes to keep their immunity levels high during a time when they are not getting enough training exposure.
“PM Sir urged us to post videos about the awareness campaign. He gave us a few pointers like ‘Laxman Rekha’ (Don’t cross the line while maintaining social distancing); ‘Sankalp Lena’ (Taking a pledge not to step out)
“He said ‘Dhairya Rakhna’ (don’t press the panic button). He also advised us to boost our immune system and stay fit by doing daily exercises,” she revealed.
Tennis player Ankita Raina said the PM equated the virus to an unknown opposition.
“(He) told us that athletes are stronger mentally and have the quality to adapt to different conditions and in unknown territories. So he wanted us to spread the positive and encouraging message since this is also an unknown territory (fight against coronavirus),” she said.",other sports
Keeping cycling alive during the pandemic,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/keeping-cycling-alive-during-the-pandemic/article31248615.ece," 
Race or no race, the 104th edition of the Tour of Flanders cobblestone cycling classic will have a winner this weekend. 
The Belgian race is one of the “Monuments” of cycling - the five most prestigious one-day events in the sport. But the “Ronde” has been scrapped from this season’s calendar because of the coronavirus pandemic. All schools in the country have been shut down, only a handful of businesses remain open for essential needs and riding bikes in large groups has been forbidden.

To keep the festive event alive, organizer Flanders Classics will host a “lockdown edition” of the race on April 5, with professional riders tackling the punishing Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg climbs from the comfort of their houses, on home trainers. 
Belgium’s big hope will be Remco Evenepoel, one of the most promising cyclists of his generation. Evenepoel, who won five races during his first pro season with the Deceuninck-Quick Step team last year, will be among the 13 professional riders taking part in the virtual race. 
“I never thought I would make my Monument debut this way, but it’s still better than nothing,” he said. “I guess I’m the first rider in history to race a Monument for the first time on a smart trainer, and as strange as it may sound, I am looking forward to it. From what I understood, it will replicate the conditions of Flanders, so it should be quite a tough test.”

The race, which started in 1913, was cancelled for the first time since World War I. 
To make this year’s virtual race happen, Flanders Classics have teamed up with TV broadcaster Sporza and technology firms Bkool and Kiswe to develop a digital platform for the virtual route as well as a live streaming app that will allow fans to follow the race. 
The event will be reserved to pros and will feature the last 32 kilometers (20 miles) of the route. Sporza said live commentary of the race will be provided by the usual duo of Michel Wuyts and Josş De Cauwer.

“It’s a difficult time for everyone, but we really hope this project will bring some happiness and a glimmer of hope to all the fans in Belgium and around the world, who will have the possibility to watch us live as we race the final part of Flanders,” said Yves Lampaert, who also rides for Deceuninck-Quick Step. 
Along with the Ronde, four other prestigious one-day classic races scheduled this month - Paris-Roubaix, the Fleche Wallonne, Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Amstel Gold race - have all been called off. The Strade Bianche and Milan-San Remo were previously postponed along with the Giro d’Italia, which was to start on May 9.

Facebook is trying to gain space in the video-chatting world with its new app that can be used in Mac and Windows.
And technology is aiding health professionals in handling the COVID-19 pandemic in two different ways. Pinterest’s CEO and his team have launched an app that allows users in the US to self-report their health data to fight the spread of COVID-19. In another effort, retired healthcare professionals are being trained using Virtual Reality to get up to speed on handling patients infected with the coronavirus.

Zoom’s CEO responds to privacy policy concerns
These past couple of weeks have been hard for Zoom as the videoconferencing app came under increasing scrutiny for unclear privacy policy and data leaks to Facebook. 
Those issues haven’t kept users from flocking to the app as it reached over 200 million daily active users in March. 
However, the company’s CEO Eric Yuan hasn’t taken the data and privacy concerns lightly. In a lengthy blog post on Wednesday, he apologised for falling short of expectations as the influx of users surged in the last few weeks.
“We recognize that we have fallen short of the community’s – and our own – privacy and security expectations,” he said. “For that, I am deeply sorry, and I want to share what we are doing about it.”
He clarified that Zoom was not designed with a foresight that every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying and socialising from home. It was primarily built for business customers, and those institutions have a robust IT support. And they have done a thorough review of Zoom’s security features before deploying the service.
The surge in users has helped Zoom identify unforeseen issues on its platform, he added.
The company has also shared its protective features in a blog post on how users can prevent zoombombing by using waiting rooms, muting controls and limiting screen sharing.
On March 27, Zoom removed its Facebook software development kit (SDK) in their iOS client. This removal helps stop Facebook from accessing data from Zoom users.
Two days later, the videoconferencing app maker updated its privacy policy to be clear and transparent on the data it collects and how it uses that information. In that update, the company said it has never sold user data, nor does it plan to sell in the future.
Facebook launches Messenger app for Mac and Windows
Facebook launched a new Messenger app for Mac and Windows desktop. The app allows users to video chat on their computers. 
The launch comes as users are increasingly using videoconferencing applications to connect with friends and family during the COVID-19 outbreak.
“Over the past month, we saw more than a 100% increase in people using their desktop browser for audio and video calling on Messenger,” Stan Chudnovsky, VP Messenger said in a statement.
The new desktop app will allow users to make unlimited free group video calls.
The app adds the users’ Facebook friends to Messenger, making it easy to make calls without inputting phone number or email address. 
The application also syncs with the app in your mobile so you can switch between devices easily.
The new app also features Dark Mode to help you cut down the white light while chatting.
Pinterest partners with scientists to launch self-reporting app
Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann and his team of researchers have joined hands with scientists from MIT, Harvard and many more institutions to develop and launch a free self-reporting COVID-19 tracking app.
The HowWeFeel app is available for download on the App Store and Play Store in the US.
After downloading the app, it takes 30 seconds to self-report how the user is feeling - - healthy or sick. This information helps scientists and doctors to use the data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
You must input your age, gender, pin code and any health symptoms you are experiencing into the app. These details go into a database, which is shared with doctors, scientists and public health researchers who are working to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The data is securely shared only with organizations working to fight the spread of coronavirus. It is currently available to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Broad Institute of MIT, the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford University.
This data can help health professionals by providing insights into areas that haven’t yet shown significant spikes in COVID-19 testing -- these locations may be on the verge of an outbreak.
Pinterest is currently partnering with The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, and the Weizmann Institute of Science. 
Training doctors with VR technology to fight COVID-19 
A VR medical training system developed by Oxford Medical Simulation (OMS) is being offered for free to help hospitals and medical institutions handle the COVID-19 outbreak, TechRepublic reported.
OMS is making its VR training system available for free to health facilities in US, Canada and the UK to get retired doctors and nurses up to speed on patient care.
""At the moment, during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are beginning to recruit more doctors and nurses, but they are also bringing doctors and nurses back into practice who have left previously"" due to retirements or going into other fields, said Dr. Jack Pottle, a physician in acute and internal medicine and the chief medical officer for OMS.
In the last two weeks, about 50 hospitals and medical institutions have taken the free training offer. This translates to roughly 17,000 additional medical professionals signing up to assist in patient care.
OMS has been working with some 50 hospitals and medical schools to give virtual training since it launched the VR platform 18 months ago.
The VR based learning helps doctors and nurses gain knowledge and experience in treating COVID-19 affected patients.
The training system provides web-based, animated patient training scenarios through a VR headset for a fully-immersive experience. If the training is taken remotely, and the user does not have a head-gear, they can access the sessions via their laptop or desktop computer. 
Digitise your documents this weekend
The COVID-19 outbreak is making us spend more time indoors. On a usual weekend, we might have planned to make a trip or visit friends and family. But, given the lockdown, that won’t happen. 
Perhaps, you can use this weekend to de-clutter documents and organise them digitally. It's no coincidence that we celebrated the World BackUp Day this week on March 31.
Making digital copies of your personal documents can be a useful backup for future retrieval. These copies can be made using a scanner, if you have access to one.
If not, you can use a document scanner app in your smartphone. The first step in your digital backup activity is getting the documents organised.
Over the years, you might have saved various different certificates, records, letters and photos. Order them and categorise them. You may do this chronologically or theme-based (for example, personal vs professional).
Once this is done, find an app that will help you scan the documents.
Some of the apps that do a good job of scanning are CamScanner, Scanbot, Adobe Scan and Microsoft Lens. You can pick one of this to scan your documents.
After scanning, save them to your personal computer, or any of the cloud drives that you’re already using.",technology
Google to shut Neighbourly app as it ‘hasn’t grown’ like they expected,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-to-shut-neighbourly-app-as-it-hasnt-grown-like-they-expected/article31245270.ece," Google has decided to shut the Neighbourly app, something it had specifically designed for India as a platform for the users to share hyper local information.
In a mail, it told users: “We wanted to let you know that we will close down the Neighbourly Beta beginning on May 12, 2020.”
The app was to “connect you with your neighbours and make sharing local information more human and helpful. As a community, you’ve come together to celebrate local festivals, shared crucial information during floods, and answered over a million questions. But Neighbourly hasn’t grown like we had hoped,” Google said.
Neighbourly was an offering from the company’s Next Billion Users team and positioned as a source of information. The decision to shut comes less than two years after the app was rolled out in major cities, with plans to take it people in hundreds of districts.
“In these difficult times, we believe that we can help more people by focusing on other Google apps that are already serving millions of people everyday. We plan to take the lessons learned from Neighbourly and use them to improve our other products. If you want to keep sharing your local knowledge with your neighbours, we encourage you to become a Google Maps Local Guide,” the mail said.
Users will be able to download their Neighbourly content till Oct 12. 
“We want to fill the hyper-local information gap that exists,” a senior executive of Google had said ahead of the Hyderabad launch in November 2018.
Neighbourly sought to make it easy, for the users, to seek advice and recommendations from neighbours who know the area on a range of aspects from eatries, bus routes, pharmacies to mode of transport to reach a location. The app was available in multiple Indian languages, he had said.",technology
Queer organisations to hold ‘Global Pride’ in June,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/queer-organisations-to-hold-global-pride-in-june/article31252485.ece,"In response to hundreds of pride parades being being cancelled or postponed around the world due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, LGBTQAI+ organisations internationally are collaborating on a digital ‘Global Pride’, to be held on June 27.
June is celebrated as pride month in the U.S., marking the anniversary of Stonewall riots, which took place between the queer community, led by drag queen Marsha P. Johnson, and the police in New York City in 1969.
The Global Pride will be live-streamed, going across various time zones starting from Australia, and will include musical performances, speeches, and key messages from human rights activists. It will be a first of its kind digital pride, which will replace live gatherings and seek global participation, even from countries where homosexuality is criminalised.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, more than an estimated 200 Prides have been cancelled or postponed globally. A largely number of prides in Europe and the U.S., including New York, Berlin, Rome and Paris, are held over the summer annually, forcing them to reassess the situation this year. According to Ron deHarte, co-president, United States Association of Prides, annual Pride events in the U.S. gather around 20 million people.
“The unprecedented challenges of COVID-19 mean that most prides will not take place as planned in 2020, but we’re determined that this won’t stop us from coming together as a united, strong LGBTQIA+ community,” said Kristine Garina, president, European Pride Organisers Association and Chair of Baltic Pride in Riga, Latvia.
The landmark 50th anniversary of Los Angeles Pride, which was scheduled to take place in mid-June, has been pushed, along with Prides in cities like Madrid, London, Bucharest, Zurich and Krakow, while Toronto has cancelled the LGBTQAI+ gathering.
“We need community and connection more than ever,” said J. Andrew Baker, co-president, Interpride. “Pride 2020 represents a milestone, with many honouring the 50th anniversary of their first gatherings and marches, such as New York to the first Gandhinagar Pride this year and we would not let that pass without recognition and celebration.”
International Pride networks, InterPride and the European Pride Organisers Association are working with national organizations in Canada, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the U.S., and reaching out to regional networks in southern Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America, to bring communities and p ride organisations together for the Global Pride.
“Especially in these difficult times full of uncertainty and insecurity, we need to show visibility,” said Uwe Hörner, a board member of CSD Deutschland [German Pride network]. “Social distancing must not lead to the disappearance of diversity.”
Dana Marsh, president, Fierté Canada Pride, said Canada is looking forward to connecting with indigenous LGBTQIA+ communities from around the globe. “We acknowledge the intersections that join us in the global fight against homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, gender discrimination, racism, sexism, classism, and colonialism,” she said.",entertainment

In India, Netflix has also committed up to four weeks of pay for all core below-the-line crew who were scheduled to work on Netflix productions in the country.
Last month, Netflix announced a $100 million fund to help with hardship in the creative community across the world. While most of the fund is pledged towards supporting the hardest hit workers on Netflix productions around the world, $15 million of the fund will go to third parties and non-profits providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast in the countries where Netflix has a large production base. Netflix’s $1 million contribution to the Producers Guild of India Relief Fund is part of this $15million fund. 
“We’re grateful to be working with the Producers Guild of India to support the hardest hit workers in TV and film production — from electricians to carpenters, hair and makeup artists to spot boys. Crews in India have always been vital to Netflix’s success and now we want to do our part and help those who most need support in these unprecedented times,” said a Netflix spokesperson.
“In the past month with all productions grinding to a halt, thousands of daily wage earners associated with the Indian film and TV industry have seen their livelihoods disappear overnight. I am proud of and thankful to the entire fraternity for contributing to the fund we have created to support our colleagues at this difficult time. We value Netflix’s generous commitment to this fund and their resolve to help those who need our help the most,” said Mr. Siddharth Roy Kapur, president of the Producers Guild of India.",entertainment

British comedian Eddie Large dies of coronavirus ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/british-comedian-eddie-large-dies-of-coronavirus/article31244687.ece," Veteran English comedian Eddie Large has passed away at the age of 78 after complications due to coronavirus. Large’s son, Ryan McGinnis, shared the news on Facebook, saying his father had been suffering with heart failure and contracted the virus in hospital.
 It is with great sadness that Mum and I need to announce that my dad passed away in the early hours of this morning. He had been suffering with heart failure and unfortunately, whilst in hospital, contracted the coronavirus, which his heart was sadly not strong enough to fight. 
 Dad had fought bravely for so long. Due to this horrible disease we had been unable to visit him at the hospital but all of the family and close friends spoke to him every day, the post read. 
The Glasgow-born artiste, whose real name was Edward McGinnis, found fame alongside comedian Syd Little in the 1970s and 80s.
 The duo performed initially in pubs and clubs in the north-west of England and gained recognition in the mainstream after appearing on the ITV talent show Opportunity Knocks . Post the show they also landed their own series, The Little and Large Telly show, in 1976. The show moved to BBC in 1978 and aired on the network for over 13 years. 
Many from the entertainment industry took to social media to pay tributes to the comedy icon. 
 Eddie Large died. Midnight Matinee Great Yarmouth 1978. They finished part one. I’d never heard laughter like it. Rude, raucous and rollicking.Dunno how they did it, but Eddies energy and electricity and impressions and props and improv were hugely impressive. R.I.P, Lenny Henry posted on Twitter.

Shah Rukh Khan lends hand to coronavirus fight on several fronts,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/shah-rukh-khan-lends-hand-to-coronavirus-fight-on-several-fronts/article31242287.ece,"After Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan, it’s the turn of another Bollywood heavyweight, Shah Rukh Khan, to put his money behind the fight against COVID-19. However, unlike Akshay and Salman, SRK’s appears to be a more diversified portfolio when it comes to charity, routing the assistance to a number of organisations through his own group of companies: Kolkata Knight Riders, Red Chillies Entertainment, Meer Foundation and Red Chillies VFX.
While lauding the Central government’s COVID-19 efforts, as well as those of the Maharashtra, West Bengal and Delhi State governments, SRK announced several key initiatives to extend his support that he hoped would “make a small difference”. “We have initially focused our efforts on the three cities — Mumbai, Kolkata and New Delhi — with the realisation that this is a start and we stand ready to contribute in whichever way possible going forward,” he said in a press communication on Thursday.
The aim is to not only provide relief during the pandemic, but also help raise awareness about COVID-19 and encourage more people to come forward and help. To ensure that the basic necessities reach many who are being deprived of them in these trying times, the allocated funds will be distributed amongst various beneficiaries for a wide range of issues and concerns.
So in the wide-ranging relief package, Kolkata Knight Riders, the IPL franchise co-owned by Gauri Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla Mehta and Jay Mehta has committed to contributing to the PM-CARES Fund.
Red Chillies Entertainment owned by Gauri Khan and Shah Rukh Khan has committed to contributing to the Maharashtra CM’s Relief Fund.
KKR & Meer Foundation will work with the West Bengal and the Maharashtra governments and contribute 50,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits for healthcare providers. They will also work to raise awareness to encourage other contributions. “Supporting and protecting the healthcare workers is of paramount importance. They are the real heroes who put their lives on the line everyday to protect us,” said the statement.
Meer Foundation, along with Ek Saath – The Earth foundation, will provide daily food requirements to over 5,500 families for at least a month in Mumbai. A kitchen will also be set up to send out 2,000 freshly cooked meals every day to help households and hospitals whose daily needs aren’t being fulfilled.
Meer Foundation, in association with Roti Foundation, will provide three lakh meal kits to 10,000 people per day for at least a month. Roti Foundation was founded by former director general of police, Maharashtra, D. Sivanandhan. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they have tied up with the Mumbai Police and are providing meals to underprivileged people and daily wage labourers.
Meer Foundation, in association with Working People’s Charter, will provide basic essentials and grocery items for at least a month to over 2,500 daily wage workers who have been identified across Delhi.
It will also provide a monthly stipend to over 100 acid attack survivors, which will take care of their basic needs. The survivors identified are across Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttarakhand.
“This is a start and all the members of the companies stand committed to doing further as we see across India what all is required and put our best effort going ahead,” said the statement.
“At a time when the human race is facing an immense crisis, there can only be one true response — the expression of humanity itself. This is a moment for all of us to come together in a collective effort to make each other kinder, stronger and braver to face the days ahead,” said SRK.
He said that the crisis is not going to pass in a hurry, it will take its time and its toll on everyone. It will also show everyone that there isn’t really a choice between looking out for oneself and looking out for one another. “There’s nothing more obvious in the spread of this pandemic, than the fact that each one of us is inextricably connected to each other, without any distinction,” he said, adding, “So, while we do whatever we can to support each other in our own small ways, the compassion we show to those who are likely to face the most brutal brunt of both, the pandemic and its economic consequences, will define us as a generation and as a nation.”
He added, “The scourge we are up against, is fearsome and unknown to us. Like all uncharted paths, our journey to overcome every new challenge it throws at us, will be arduous. There will be times when the best intentions might yield the wrong results. There may also be times when we accidentally stumble upon important solutions. All we can really do is try our utmost to adapt and confront each challenge with courage. As a nation, and as a people, it is our duty to give it all we’ve got. Only together we will be able to fight through these difficult and unimaginable days.” 
He ended in his characteristic starry style, bending his own popular “Aur paas, aur paas (And closer and closer)” dialogue in Dil To Pagal Hai to urge people to maintain distance: “Thoda door...aur door...aur door...aur door (a little further, and further, and further)” 
Earlier Akshay Kumar had pledged ₹25 crore to the PM-CARES Fund and Salman Khan had come forward to financially support 25,000 daily wagers from the film industry through his Being Human foundation. ",entertainment

Leading Indian photographers unite for Instagram Live workshop series,https://www.thehindu.com/society/under-lockdown-leading-indian-photographers-unite-for-instagram-live-workshops/article31248417.ece,"An elephant bathes in freshly-roused dust. A leopard stretches languidly on a tree. There are many visual treasures that spring to mind at the mention of wildlife photography. Yet more leap up at words like landcape, travel, street, portrait, food or wedding. There is no limit to the kinds of images, moods and truths that can be captured by lens, and distinctions between them aren’t always clear-cut.
While we do not, for the moment, have the luxury to step out and try our hand at them, we can choose to sit back and learn a bit, and marvel at the works of some of India’s best-known photographers while at it. Madras Photo Bloggers has brought together 15 accomplished photographers to tune in from their homes in different cities, for a day-long event wherein they will be interacting, demonstrating and instructing live on Instagram. Srivatsan Sankaran, founder of Madras Photo Bloggers, gives us an introduction to some of the more prominent names in his lineup:

“Sudhir Shivaram is one of the most popular wild life photographers in India. His pictures are noteworthy for their technically sophisticated and evocative character, generating appropriate moods to move viewers,” begins Srivatsan, “He campaigns for wildlife protection around the world, and freely gives his time and images to raise awareness. He also talks about his work and the state of wildlife to young people across the world, hoping to win their commitment to this cause. He was also one of the brand ambassadors of Canon, and the founding member of the non-profit photo sharing site India Nature watch.”
Conservation is clearly a common thread for a number of the wildlife and Nature photographers who are part of this marathon. “Saurabh Desai, Gujarat-based Nature photographer, has now established his own media production house, 50mm Media Productions, and published a coffee table book named Visual Poetries - Fine Art Nature Photography. He has won numerous national and international accolades and has had his work published on platforms like SAEVUS, Sanctuary Asia, National Geographic and Better Photography.

[Chennai-based] Rathika Ramasamy is an Indian wildlife photographer. She has received accolades for her photographs and has been called the ‘first Indian woman to strike an international reputation as a wildlife photographer’,” paraphrases Srivatsan.
It isn’t all about Nature, however. The marathon will also feature popular culinary photographer Ambica Selvam from Bengaluru, documentary photographers Saurabh Chatterjee from Hyderabad and Sanak Roy Choudhury from Kolkata, motorsport photographer Ankit Sharma from Mumbai, and fine art and wedding photographer Saurabh Desai from Vadodara, among others. Needless to say, each niche category requires a particular set of skills, and some technical knowhow to be mastered over time, with practice.

“We will be discussing their genre, work style, challenges and a few technical tips. It is a mix of both workshop and discussion, and of course, everyone will learn from experts,” says Srivatsan, adding, “The whole idea behind this session is to motivate people to explore their interest, since many aren’t clued in about their field. Beginners will benefit, since it helps to understand their own interests within photography.”
And how will the entire event work? It’s simple, says, Srivatsan, “We have 16 photographers and so there will be 16 sessions. Each photographer will spend half an hour for live interaction, with a five to 10 minutes gap in between sessions. We are doing the whole session live without any break.” The photographers won’t be handling everything alone, he adds: “Three student ambassadors will be hosting the live interactions since it will be helpful for them, and two from my team will be part of hosting as well.”
The advantage of it all being online, of course, is that you don’t have to sit through all of it. “Yes, people can choose to follow one or two sessions according their interests,” signs off Srivatsan.
Pan Indian Photographer’s interaction marathon will be held on April 5, from 9.30 am to 9.30 pm on the Instagram handle @madrasphotoblogs.

"Pandemics and prejudice: When there is an epidemic, social prejudices resurface",https://www.thehindu.com/society/pandemics-and-prejudice-when-there-is-an-epidemic-social-prejudices-resurface/article31246102.ece,"In the early 1900s in New York, a strange event took place in the upscale enclaves of Long Island. Many of its denizens began to mysteriously contract typhoid. The emergence of a disease associated with filth and poverty in a slick and affluent quarter deeply unsettled the city’s medical establishment. 
A sanitary engineer named George Soper was asked to investigate the phenomenon. He discovered that a cook named Mary Mallon, a middle-aged Irishwoman, had worked for at least eight of the families that had been attacked by typhoid. Mallon, herself perfectly healthy, would leave her employment each time a case broke out and move to another family. Soper set off on a hunt. He traced Mallon’s whereabouts, stalked her to find where she lived, and finally confronted her, accusing her of being a carrier of typhoid. When Mallon refused to cooperate and undergo medical tests, Soper convinced the police to arrest her. 
Incarcerated purely on a hypothesis, Mallon’s blood, urine and faecal samples were then collected against her will. When the results came back, they showed the presence of Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes typhoid, and the noose of public disapproval quickly fell around her neck. 
Soper was celebrated for having established the existence of ‘healthy carriers’ — people who carry and spread disease-causing pathogens but stay unaffected. Mallon was disgraced and went down in history as ‘Typhoid Mary’. 
For decades, that unkind moniker normalised the violence and vilification of a poor, illiterate, immigrant woman, who was also a passionate and gifted cook. Mallon was demonised by the medical establishment and the press as a ‘super-spreader’, akin to a mass murderer. She was believed to have infected 51 people, three of whom died, but exact numbers were difficult to establish. 
Finding the enemy
Mallon was sent into quarantine for 26 years, next to the Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, where she finally died in 1938. An impassioned exoneration came 63 years later, from an unexpected yet unsurprising quarter. In Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical (2001), the late Anthony Bourdain wrote with great empathy for his fellow chef: “Cooks work sick. They always have. Most jobs, you don’t work, you don’t get paid. You wake up with a sniffle and a runny nose, a sore throat? You soldier on. You put in your hours. You wrap a towel around your neck, and you do your best to get through. It’s a point of pride, working through pain and illness.”

Typhoid outbreaks were not new to New York City, but Mallon had been singled out as a public enemy, more deadly than the disease itself. Her true crime, perhaps, was reminding the rich and powerful that pathogens had little respect for the class divide that separated Long Island from the Bronx.
*** 
The story of people and pathogens is that of a difficult evolutionary marriage. Pathogens want to live and prosper. Killing off humans — the hosts — would become a self-defeating exercise. Both parties, therefore, try to work towards mutual survival. After a certain point in time, the two declare an uneasy truce and humans start to live with the pathogen. We have done so many times before, and we will do so with the novel coronavirus. 
The biological coexistence that emerges out of a pandemic is in stark contrast to its social effects. Diseases don’t have a social preference, and pathogens don’t distinguish victims by race, class, religion, gender or other identities. However, history shows that each time there is a pandemic, deep-rooted social prejudice resurfaces, often with horrifying results. 
During the Great Bubonic Plague in Europe in 1348, the Catholic Church was convinced that the Black Death was a Jewish conspiracy to undermine Christianity. Accused of poisoning wells to spread the disease, Jews were subjected to horrific torture and forced to make false confessions. Soon, the mephitic smell of the burning flesh of thousands of Jews lingered in the air of Strasbourg, Cologne, Basel and Mainz.
The Roma of Europe faced similar persecution. Giorgio Viaggio, in his book Storia Degli Zingari in Italia (1997), has documented 121 laws framed in Italy between 1493 and 1785, restricting the movement of Zingaris (a pejorative term for Romas). Such laws were driven partly by the prejudiced view that the Roma people caused and spread epidemics. 
In medieval Europe, outbreaks of plague were blamed on people who practised traditional medicine. They were branded ‘witches’ and persecuted. Historian Brian Levack (2006) estimated that 90,000 people were punished for witchcraft in Europe. Though we don’t have exact figures, the brunt of it seems to have been borne by women. 
 ***
The medieval belief in plague spreaders was dispelled with the arrival of germ theory. Diseases were spread not by people but by micro-organisms or pathogens. They could travel through air, water or physical contact between humans and non-humans. We learnt that germs had no regard for social categorisations. One assumed that the discovery of this apolitical and amoral ‘germ’ would lead to epidemics being seen through the clear lens of a microscope and not by glasses tinted with prejudice.

But the microscope was not only an instrument of discovery; it was a tool of the Empire. The tropics were teeming with diseases, detrimental to the health of Anglo-European administrators. Mosquitoes, it seemed, were far more insurgent than colonial subjects. It was the microscope that shaped the colonial understanding of “tropical disease”. The outbreak of ‘Asiatic cholera’ in 1817 — a pandemic named because it was believed to be endemic to India’s Gangetic region — soon spread to Europe and sparked fears of an invasion of diseases originating in the colonies. 
This prompted intense scientific enquiry. In his nuanced account of the attempt of 19th-century medical science to localise diseases, historian Pratik Chakrabarti writes in 2010 of how Robert Koch’s discovery of Vibrio cholerae — the comma-shaped cholera pathogen — was pinned to the tropical environment and body. Specifically, the intestine and biliary tract of the colonial subject. 
Then there was leprosy, so stigmatised that the word ‘leper’ became synonymous with a social outcast. The Manusmriti mandated the ostracisation of lepers as ‘sinners’. Even after the Leprosy Commission report in 1891 concluded that the “amount of contagion is so small it may be disregarded,” Indian and European upper classes actively campaigned against allowing the afflicted to be seen in public, as their sight produced disgust and loathing. This led to the Leprosy Act of 1898, which institutionalised people with leprosy, even using gender segregation to prevent reproduction. All to please the aesthetic sensibilities of the colonial elite. 
If colonial science contributed to the tropicalisation of epidemics, literature reified it. Thomas Mann’s novella Death in Venice, set in the city of water during a cholera outbreak, described the disease as ‘Indian cholera’, which, “…born in the sultry swamps of the Ganges delta, ascended with the mephitic odor of that unrestrained and unfit wasteland, that wilderness avoided by men…”. 
Epidemic orientalism
Researcher Alexandre White in 2018 referred to such incidents of colonial construction as “epidemic orientalism” in his thesis. This often shaped the way diseases were named — Asiatic cholera (1826), Asiatic plague (1846), Asiatic flu (1956), Rift Valley fever (the 1900s), Middle East respiratory syndrome (2012), Hong Kong flu (1968), to cite a few. Now, the World Health Organisation has guidelines to name infectious diseases in neutral, generic terms. 
Socially, however, epidemics and diseases continue to be pinned to race, gender, sexual preference and geography. The Trump administration has repeatedly called COVID-19 the ‘Chinese virus’, and some refer to it as ‘Kung Flu’. Naming reinforces prejudice. The original term for HIV/ AIDS was the acronym GRID — Gay Related Immunodeficiency. Though short-lived, it worked to boost what American televangelists were already calling it in the 80s: “gay plague” — divine punishment for sexual deviance. The belief that HIV/ AIDS has a preference for gay men now lives on in legislation in various countries, prohibiting men who have sex with men (MSMs) from donating blood or organs. 
***
If history tells us one thing, it is that we have managed to deal with disease-causing pathogens significantly better than with our entrenched prejudices. Pandemics don’t produce hate, but they do serve to amplify it. 
The Trump administration would like to believe that the Chinese government’s mismanagement and attempts to cover up the incidence and spread of COVID-19 is a conspiracy aimed at destabilising America. It recalls the Catholic Church’s invocation of the notion of pestis manufacta (diabolically produced disease) to accuse Jews of trying to sabotage Christianity. Similarly, European politicians Le Pen and Salvini’s racist invectives against migrants and refugees as carriers of the coronavirus intersects with Trump’s rhetoric. During his campaign for the U.S. presidency four years ago, Trump revived the medieval European idea of ‘plague spreaders’ by claiming, “Tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border” carried by Mexican immigrants. Ironically, it is Mexico today that’s guarding its borders from carriers entering from the U.S.

India’s latent prejudices have similarly risen in tandem with COVID-19. Building owners have barred entry of medical staff into their own homes. People speak of social distancing using the terminology of caste and untouchability. People from Northeast India are facing racist comments and threats of eviction. The same government that sent planes to ferry Indians back from foreign countries failed to house its poor migrant labourers or to send them safely home. The ongoing lockdown has seen a mass exodus of workers, trekking hundreds of kilometres to get home, sleeping on streets, struggling for food and water. Some 20 have died so far. As this goes to press, governments are scrambling to set up relief camps for those persuaded to stay back, and transport those who insist on leaving. And in U.P., returning workers are hosed down with surface disinfectants as if they were the pathogens. Added to this, communal prejudice has found new viral spread, riding piggyback on the Tablighi Jamaat conclave in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area.
***
Science was supposed to liberate people from irrational beliefs by proving that pathogens don’t look for a particular race or place — all they need is a human body, warm, moist and nutrient-rich. Unfortunately, even the scientific understanding of hosts, vectors and carriers has been appropriated to reinforce social prejudices.
Stigma produced in the churn of a pandemic has a long afterlife. No one understood that better than Mary Mallon. Quarantined for more than a quarter of her life, her name is still synonymous with disease. 
The same aggressive hounding of the afflicted persists today. Desperate to maintain quarantine, governments are publishing patient names and addresses, affixing door stickers, stamping their skin with indelible ink, all of which violate medical ethics and could lead to social ostracism. 
And we stand today facing the same question a poor, immigrant woman asked of society at the beginning of the 20th century. Is it necessary to forego humanity in order to save human life?

‘Tales from the Loop’ review: A beautifully-shot poetic puzzle,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tales-from-the-loop-review-a-beautifully-shot-poetic-puzzle/article31249618.ece,"With my limited knowledge of the world of arts, before embarking on the new Amazon Prime series, I had to educate myself on Swedish artiste Simon Stalenhag’s phantasmagoric works. The characteristic juxtaposition of giant robots, massive machines, mammoth structures and humongous flying saucers against an everyday landscape—cars careening on expressways, kids playing in the field or walking in the meadow with their parents. Stalenhag’s work is exquisite, intriguing and enigmatic, a combination of the real and the surreal that enchants even as it confounds.
In that sense the three episodes of Tales from the Loop that one got to preview can also best be described as poetic puzzles. The beautifully-shot series approximates Stalenhag’s visuality. The retro-futuristic scenery is omnipresent in each of the episodes even as human, emotional tales play out at the core. The bizarre backdrop itself may have a remote, distancing effect but the people, their relationships, dilemmas and feelings are relatable and universal. 
Based on Simon Stalenhag’s narrative book by the same name, the series is an assortment of stories involving townspeople (Sweden relocated to small town America) living above the “Loop”, a machine that is supposed to unlock and explain the mysteries of the universe. 
The episodes I saw were all to do with reconciliation and underlined with melancholia and also a hope for continuities. The first, about abandonment and coming to terms with it, has young Loretta (Abby Ryder Fortson) wondering about the nature of her mother’s work in the Loop and going on a search herself. One that makes her realise that people and things disappear and get lost and one has to give oneself time to heal from loss. 

Episode four, has another kid Cole (Duncan Joiner) understanding the meaning of life and death, of the unfairness of sudden absences of people, all through a mysterious structure called Echo Sphere. 
And episode six, a new take on an age-old doppelgänger tale, has the security person at the Loop, Gaddis (Ato Essandoh) coming to terms with his own unresolved loneliness and craving for irrational love and fulfilment, by landing into an unknown parallel world. Will this new plane of existence be the answer? Will it lead him to the start of something new?
Like all good sci-fi it’s the human aspect that makes an impact, but plenty of the elements of technological fantasy feel facile than profound. The scientific design and human drama feels at a disjunct at points. The open-endedness makes science feel almost spiritual and haunting at points and at others annoyingly inane. The element of the unknown have a touch of The Twilight Zone but I thought the eerieness lingered there more chillingly, or perhaps I am another generation of viewer altogether. 
The cast is led by the ever-dependable Jonathan Pryce, as the force behind the Loop, an actor who cannot put a wrong foot forward, but it’s the two children — Fortson and Joiner — and Essandoh who steal the show. 
The narrative moves slowly, at points the stillness gets immovable. It’s an aspect that you feel more intently in these socially distanced days when time seems to be stuck. The interesting bit about the calmness, however, is that it also makes you notice the tiniest of details. The poster of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman’s Summer With Monika in the local cinema, in the first episode for instance. A nod to flighty women as well as the series’ Swedish origins? But how would the film have got released there is still perplexing me. On a more serious note, the contemplative mood will either make you feel more invested in the stories or may just make you want to get off the ride even as The Tales from the Loop tries hard to balance between the bleak and the beautiful.

‘The Professor’ Alvaro Morte: ‘I hope Money Heist entertains people dealing with the lockdown’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-professor-alvaro-morte-i-hope-money-heist-entertains-people-dealing-with-the-lockdown/article31249454.ece,"Spanish star Alvaro Morte, better known in this part of the world as The Professor of Spanish crime drama Money Heist, says he is practising social distancing like the rest of the world and believes humanity will emerge stronger from the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.
As COVID-19 spreads across the globe and millions of people stay cooped indoors, the fourth season of Netflix’s most watched non-English drama dropped on Friday.
Spain is among the countries worst hit by the virus with 1,12,065 cases and over 10,000 fatalities.
Morte, who recently took to Instagram to sing Bella Ciao, the Italian resistance song that features prominently in the show, believes this is the time for people to reflect on their roles as individuals and as part of society.

‘Money Heist’ season 4 review: A fast-paced surprise for fans, albeit a little frustrating at times

“I’m trying to be as responsible as I can, leaving my house just for the really essential things. I’m aware there are so many people working very hard and having a hard time so that the rest of us can lead as normal a life as can be,” Morte told PTI over the phone from his home in Madrid.
“I try to give the time we are in the importance it deserves. We should take time to reflect what is happening, to try to be responsible individually speaking and as a society,” the actor added.
Morte said that everyone should try and bring out something positive from what’s happening, try to learn something and try to see what we can change in order to become a better society.
Morte also had a small message for his fans in India: “I am sending all my love from here. All the strength and courage I can send through this confinement and lockdown. I hope the show entertains you a little bit,” he said.
The Netflix drama, more elegantly titled La Casa de Papel (The Paper House) in Spanish, revolves around Morte’s character bringing together a bunch of other career criminals who dress up in red jumpsuits and a Salvador Dali mask to rob the Royal Mint of Spain.
Unsurprisingly, the red costumes, the Dali mask and ‘Bella Ciao’ (Goodbye Beautiful) have become popular with fans world over, even featuring in real political protests. A recent video of an Italian neighbourhood singing the song during the lockdown was circulated widely on social media.
Asked about the significance of the folk anthem in the show, Morte said it is their attempt to remind the audiences the struggles of humanity and the advances it has made.
The Italian protest song was first sung by women working in paddy fields and later adopted as the anti-fascist anthem by Italian Resistance.
“I’m well aware of the icons of the show and how powerful they have been. We have the red jumpsuits, the Dali masks and the anthem ‘Bella Ciao’, which is a very interesting detail. Human beings have gone through processes that have somehow marked history. It’s something we mustn’t forget. For us to put this anthem again on the table, is a way of telling the audience that we mustn’t forget what we have achieved. We must try not to go backwards, always forwards,” Morte said.
In the fourth season of the show, the actor said, The Professor starts losing control with his gang stuck inside the Bank of Spain and his girlfriend, ex-cop Raquel, caught by the police.
“It is made complicated by enabling this character to be dragged by the things of the heart because he always says that his brain is an engine. He tries not to have anything sentimental influence what he does. It is funny to see him fall into the trap he condemns everyone about,” Morte explains.
To make his character interesting, the 45-year-old came up with personality traits like The Professor’s habit of adjusting his glasses when he is nervous.
“I love to study my characters and include the physical point of view. I analyse the character from inside and then add gestures the physicality that, I think, goes along with the character. For The Professor, I inspired myself from the superhero universe. I find his glasses to be like a mask. I found a very specific way of doing it in this double movement. I studied a lot to include this in the character,” he said.
Asked about the change the show has brought in his life, Morte said it is a mixed bag.
“On a professional level, it has changed many things. I have many projects on the table right now thanks to the show. I feel really grateful. But on a personal level, it has been difficult as I feel I have lost my anonymity. We are observed all the time. I try to protect my family as much as possible from it,” he concluded.",movies
Literary icons to watch on film during the coronavirus lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/literary-documentaries-to-watch-about-joan-didion-ted-hughes-jg-ballard-gore-vidal-and-james-ellroy-during-the-lockdown/article31249406.ece,"After a friend and I watched Manto on the large screen a couple of years ago, we were talking about how literary documentaries were difficult to come by in India. Now, thanks to Netflix and company, this has changed significantly. Given the current lockdown, here are five literary documentaries you can watch online.
James Ellroy: Feast of Death (YouTube)
The celebrated author of The Black Dahlia, LA Confidential and dozens of other blockbuster crime novels opens up in this (surprisingly) thrill-a-minute 2001 documentary, structured like one of Ellroy’s whodunits. At the heart of many of his novels lay the decades-old, unsolved murder of Ellroy’s own mother. From this starting point, the film explores several aspects of the creative process, in particular how one fictionalises real-world experiences, especially traumatic ones (without sacrificing one’s mental health). 






From ‘Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold’
 






Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold (Netflix India)
 Joan Didion (Play It As It Lays, The Year of Magical Thinking) was among a bunch of American writers in the 70s who made significant stylistic breakthroughs in journalism and book-length non-fiction, often employing novelistic techniques. The resultant ‘New Journalism’ remains an influential style with longform specialists. Didion has written some very moving books about her own family life, so it’s fitting that The Centre Will Not Hold was made by her nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne. It is fascinating to see the now 85-year-old Didion talk about her salad days, covering California micro-cultures in the late 60s and early 70s, the stuff of novels like Inherent Vice. 






From ‘Gore Vidal: The United States of Amnesia’
 






Gore Vidal: The United States of Amnesia (Netflix India)
Gore Vidal (1925-2012) was nothing if not controversial — indeed, he was downright offensive, misogynistic and tone-deaf towards the end of his life, like the time he called the 13-year-old girl raped by Roman Polanski “a young [prostitute] who got upset”. He was also, as it so happens, an accomplished writer of both fiction and non-fiction. In his seven-part Narratives of Empire novel series (1968-2000), for example, Vidal gives us a sweeping, large-scale indictment of America’s militaristic ways. In The United States of Amnesia (2013), a candid Vidal talks about the highs and lows of his six-decade-long career (including fun sideshows like the time he acted in a Fellini movie, and much later, played a science fiction villain in the Hollywood film Gattaca, alongside Uma Thurman). 






The South Bank Show: JG Ballard  






The South Bank Show: JG Ballard (YouTube)
JG Ballard (1930-2009) was one of the finest and most prescient writers of speculative fiction. In brilliant novels like High-Rise, Crash and The Drowned World, Ballard seemed to anticipate the pitfalls of techno-capitalist excesses around the world. In a 40-minute 2006 episode of The South Bank Show (a regular art and culture show on iTV), Ballard is extensively interviewed about his themes and influences, as well his prognosis for some of the most complicated problems of the 21st century. This really is a must-watch for all science fiction fans (added bonus being Ballard reading some of his best lines in his sonorous voice). 






Ted Hughes: Force of Nature  






Ted Hughes: Force of Nature (YouTube)
This 1998 BBC documentary was released a few months after Hughes, one of the best-known British poets of all time, died. Its chief strength is the line-up of writers, editors and poets who talk about Hughes throughout the film — Al Alvarez, John Carey, Simon Armitage and so on. Fair warning: in the best British stiff upper lip tradition, it tries to downplay Hughes’ cheating, philandering, emotionally abusive ways during his marriage with the American poet Sylvia Plath.

Nagathihalli Chandrashekar releases his Kannada film virtually,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nagathihalli-chandrashekars-india-vs-engalnd-streams-on-amazon-prime/article31248795.ece,"Nagathihalli Chandrashekar’s India V/S England  created waves because of the star cast which included Suma Latha, Anant Nag and Vasishta Simha in lead roles. The film also became the talk of the town because Vasishta had a makeover for this film, which released on January 24 worldwide. “Sadly we had to cancel the screenings in Hong Kong and Singapore in the end of February as by then COVID-19 had affected most countries. We cancelled screenings in the State too as by then people were apprehensive of being in crowded places. I felt the film’s run was stopped mid-way,” says the director who also wrote the film.







Nagathihalli released the film on Amazon Prime. “It is sad that a film, which was made for a theatre audience is now being streamed online. It is like a print journalist, who thinks of a layout, page design and puts in a lot of thought into how to display his/her story, but due to circumstances has to forgo print and think digitally. In film too we put in a lot of effort into visuals and sound design, which a small screen cannot do justice to. However, I feel this is how cinema will transition from theatre to the small screen. I believe people will need more time to recover from the fear of sitting in a theatre and watching a film.” 
“My films are aimed at the entire family. India Vs England has romance, a little bit of gemmology, a patriotic song and more. Releasing the film online will make it easy for the entire family to watch the film together,” states the director. 
According to him, even after April 14, people should practise caution to control the spread of the virus. “I speak to Kannadigas abroad and know they feel we are safer here as the government is strict and people are also adhering to government directives,” adds Nagathihalli. The film was streamed in India on April 3. ",movies
Prabhudheva’s best dance sequences: From ‘Chikku Bukku’ to ‘Guleba’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/prabhudhevas-best-dance-sequences-from-chikku-bukku-to-guleba/article31246248.ece,"Until a certain Prabhudheva came along, dance choreography in Tamil cinema — unless it was based on a classical dance form — was limited to functional exercises, weird mannerisms of star actors and (if you’re a connoisseur of Telugu film songs on YouTube) odd movements of the waist and derriere.
His rise to prominence as a choreographer, first, and an actor, subsequently, inspired many others, especially his peers who debuted in Tamil films around the same time and were looking to make their mark, to take up dancing and improve this peculiar skill to move their feet faster than your eyes can follow. Years later, we had a rejuvenated Vijay and actors like Bharath and Allu Arjun follow suit.
But it was Prabhudheva who first captured the imagination of a millennial crowd unlike any actor or film personality had done before. It was with awe that people tuned into their television sets in the ‘90s to watch him bend his body at will. Such unmatched skill even led a TV network, at one point, to name a talent hunt show after the man. The objective: to find out who was going to be the next Prabhudheva? And some say, they are still searching for ‘The One’.
The man who rose to fame as the Indian equivalent of Michael Jackson — only on the count of similarity and ease with which Prabhudheva twisted and moved his body around — turns 47 today, and we bring you a list of 10 songs (across a career spanning three decades) that best captured this wiry-haired, soft-spoken actor-director’s dancing prowess.
Prabhudheva gives a great deal of attention to his costume detail much like the choreography. Until ‘Chikku Bukku’, he had only appeared in songs that had the essence of ‘gaana’ to its music, and rural/rustic to its visual detail. ‘April Mayile’ song by Ilaiyaraaja in Idhayam, although urban, was a more melody track. Courtesy Rahman, ‘Chikku Bukku’ became the dance pop sensation that everybody loved to move their feet to. And there was Prabhudheva, alongside Gautami Tadimalla, capturing youngsters’ attention with his high jumps and baggy pants, twisting his body like it was nobody else’s business.
This film saw the debut of Prabhudheva in a lead role although he had made several appearances in films prior to Indhu.
Deva’s beats renders this song a very disco-pop feel, and the copious MJ influence is felt not only in the music but also in Prabhudheva’s costumes and moves. Matching steps with him is Khushbu, who also appeared in a dance sequence in his directorial Villu (2009), starring Vijay. This iconic track from the ‘90s was featured in last year’s super hit film Kaithi.
Prabhudheva emerged as a box office success after S Shankar’s Kaadhalan. The story behind Kaadhalan goes that Shankar was not keen on casting Prabhudheva, an untested entity, in a big budget production venture. When the producer KT Kunjumon insisted, the decision was made to splash out on songs and bet the film’s success on its visual appeal. It was a bet that paid off and much of the credit went to Prabhudheva’s enigmatic choreography and AR Rahman’s mind-blowing album.
The dance solo at the end of the track is the highlight. The white suit, hat, glove and boots became synonymous with the song. Kaadhalan also had other equally well-choreographed songs like ‘Pettai Rap’ and ‘Urvasi Urvasi’. But so popular is ‘Mukkala Mukkabala’ that it was remixed in the recently-released Street Dancer 3D, and which had the now 47-year-old dancing icon retrace his steps in the trademark white suit: faceless and without hands but still leaving us all in awe.
What best conveys the emotion in a song? The lyrics? The singer’s voice? The mood/setting of the song? The actors? Prabhudheva proved that dance too can make us feel what a Catch 22 situation feels like in this beautifully choreographed song. It fetched him a National Award.
When he jumps off a high point at the conclusion of the line: “Naam Iravin Madiyil Pillaigal Aavom... Paalootta Nilavundu”, it is not just Hariharan’s mellifluous voice or the gentle beats of AR Rahman that makes us feel the drop, it is Prabhudheva.
This lovely ‘dappankuthu’ song is courtesy Karthik Raja. Making things more interesting on screen alongside Prabhudheva is an ‘effervescent’ Kamal Haasan, who, as we recall, has not moved his feet to such a foot-thumping, masala song ever since.
Kaathala Kaathala was a successful film due to its strong writing and comedy. But ‘Kaasumela’ lives on with the viewer long after the film is over. This is one of those ‘must watch’ videos for the sheer chaos that unfolds, and the bliss that it helps generate.
The gaana anthem of the late ‘90s, and who else but Deva to come up with such a masterpiece! If ‘Kaasumela’ was organised in its chaos, ‘Kaathadikkuthu’ was unhinged from the start. The brilliance in this choreography is how over two dozen people are on the screen in every frame of the song, and still manage to move in a synchronised manner to the thump of Deva’s beats without it ever appearing jarring, which takes some coaching. As the film’s heroine Keerthi Reddy exclaims: “Ithaan party!” Another fun song in this film is the ‘Thirupathi Ezhumalai Venkatesa’ number.
If there ever was one actor who could match step-to-step with Prabhudheva (and it doesn’t mean similar skill/prowess) on screen it was Roja. The pair had an amazing chemistry in all their films, and which, especially, came through in the many fun song sequences they have danced together in.
This number sung by Unni Menon and Anuradha Sriram is an example. Quirkiness and fun quotient have always been an innate quality of Prabhudheva’s choreography, and this one is no different. There are other impressively choreographed songs the Prabhudheva-Roja combo have given us. Do check out ‘Masthana Masthana’ from Raasaiyya (1995) and ‘Siva Siva Siva Sankara’ from the record-creating film Suyamvaram (1999).
This one is for the highlight reel. ‘Vaadi Vaadi’ has that moment when Prabhudheva goes: ‘Guys, just hold on to my hands, and watch my body do the rest.’ It is the ultimate “Hold my beer” moment, and when his wiry frame moves twists around, at some point, you do tend to wonder if that body is made of muscle or latex.
One of the priceless songs in Tamil cinema. The choreography in this is top-notch in how it tries to bring back retro style to fit into the new millennium. Credit where it is due, the song is what it is due to Yuvan Shankar Raja, one of the brightest, young talents emerging in Tamil cinema at the time.
The jazzy beats and the predominantly mannerism-based choreograph throughout makes it a jolly watch. Watch out for when the wigs and bell bottoms come on. And did we mention how good a pair Prabhudheva and Roja make on screen? There is just one hiccup; they cannot scale the legendary status of Prabhudheva-Vadivelu. United to create chaos for a song, after their exploits in ‘Pettai Rap’, Vadivelu hit it out of the park in ‘All Day Jolly Day’.
Is there any other man in their mid-40s who is as nimble-footed and dance with such suave as Prabhudheva? On the comeback trail, as an actor, Guleba had a wider appeal because Prabhudheva had expanded his markets to beyond South India, and was an established name as a filmmaker in Bollywood. Much like ‘Kaathadikkuthu’, there is chaos on screen but much like ‘Kaasumela’, it is super organised. The costumes are flashy, the lights and the set make it impossible to take your eyes away from the dancing sensation.
Special Mention:
The most viewed Indian song on YouTube (the all time record) belongs to Rowdy Baby. Now, credit goes to Yuvan Shankar Raja’s beats and the screen presence of Sai Pallavi and Dhanush, the stunning set in which it was shot. But the dance moves belong to our man Prabhudheva. Rowdy Baby bent our imagination as much as ‘Main Aisa Kyun Hoon’ did to Hrithik Roshan in Lakshya (2004).",movies
"Bored this weekend? Here are five Tamil films you can check out on the likes of Sun TV, Vijay TV and others",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/what-to-watch-on-tamil-television-this-weekend/article31247186.ece,"Irumbuthirai - Saturday (April 4), 4.30 pm, Zee Tamil
We’ve seen thrillers before, but this was probably one of the first times Kollywood chose to make cyber-crime as its central focus. The PS Mithran-directed hit had its focus on crimes that take place in the digital world, with Arjun (’digital world oda don’) taking on Major Kathiravan, played by Vishal. Apart from its thrilling cat-and-mouse game between the protagonist and antagonist, it also manages to throw light on the difficulties an army man, who has guarded the country’s borders on many occasions, faces while trying for a bank loan. 
Thirupaachi - Sunday (April 5), 6.30 pm, Sun TV
Remember the names Sivagiri and Pattasu Baalu? These characters dominate Thirupaachi’s universe, one that is filled with a lot of anger and action. Today, when you look back, it has been ages since Vijay did such a rural fast-paced outing — probably the closest he could ever come to doing a Hari fim. This film, directed by Perarasu, also has loads of sister sentiment packed into it, something that Tamil audiences really bought into at that point of time. And, who doesn’t like the sight of Vijay and Trisha dancing those cute steps in ‘Kannum Kannum’?
Mersal - Sunday (April 5), 6pm, Zee Tamil
Like last Sunday, when Ghilli was aired and Vijay fans went bonkers, this Sunday evening is time for celebration yet again. We will get to watch Vijay in three memorable roles in this Atlee-directed superhit that has magic, medicine, and mystery. If the love portions initially does not hold you attention, the SJ Suryah-Vijay face-off is certainly set to give you some kushi. 
Chennaieil Oru Nal - Sunday (April 5), 7 pm, KTV
It’s a race against time. It’s a big day for four different characters in Chennai whose lives might just intersect at some point of time. Meanwhile, a girl is struggling for life elsewhere, and she needs to be saved. In this Tamil remake of Malayalam film Traffic, there’s tension, emotion and speed, and a calm Sarath Kumar, who plays Chennai Traffic police commissioner Sundarapandiyan. 







War (dubbed) - Sunday (April 5),3 pm, Vijay TV
If action is your thing, then this Hindi film, starring Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff, could be right up your alley. You will have them speaking Tamil in this dubbed version of a film that sees some pretty high-octane action sequences and a cat-and-mouse game of sorts between the two leads. The Siddharth Anand-directed film also throws light on how a guru-sishya relationship pans out in the armed forces.",movies

New April releases on Netflix: ‘Money Heist’ season 4, Chris Hemsworth’s ‘Extraction’, and more

We left the masked robbers in one of the toughest situations they have faced — Lisbon, formerly Inspector Raquel Murillo (Itziar Ituño) is assumed to be executed, they’ve set off missiles in the heart of the city in retaliation, and Nairobi’s (Alba Flores) life hangs in the balance. Where do they go from here? For the viewer, the moral question of who we should be rooting for continues to puzzle at every turn.
Inspector Alicia Sierra (Najwa Nimri) is relentless in the command centre, at times, even defying Colonel Luis Tamayo’s orders. The Professor (Álvaro Morte), it seems, has lost his mojo. And within the Bank of Spain, relationship troubles seem to be putting the entire operation in peril. There are several textbook examples of why working with your significant other is not the best idea — perhaps made more relatable by the current WFH scenario.







Lessons through flashbacks
Even in part three, Rodrigo De la Serna as Martin/Palermo exhibited the sort of controlling tendencies that made him a questionable leader. This time around, he channels a frightening instability that the gang is increasingly uncomfortable with. Through flashbacks featuring Berlin (Pedro Alonso), we get some clarity to the situation — Palermo’s loyalties lie with his plan, not with The Professor, and he will do whatever it takes to make sure everyone is in line. To this end, new alliances are formed and broken, putting everyone in the bank in a precarious position. If Tokyo’s (Ursula Corbero) irrational decisions in previous seasons were frustrating to watch, Palermo’s antics are equally grating.
Money Heist (La casa de papel)Cast: Álvaro Morte, Itziar Ituño, Ursula Corbero, Rodrigo De la Serna, Alba Flores, Najwa NimriStoryline: Chaos reigns in the Bank of Spain as a group of masked robbers attempt the heist of a lifetimeEpisodes: 8
One would think that a high-pressure hostage/heist situation requires cool heads and calculated, logical reasoning. What makes Money Heist so captivating is that it allows human emotion to rule over all. Rio’s (Miguel Herrán) post-traumatic stress disorder (from being imprisoned and tortured by Sierra) is an expected response. For people who put their life in danger to rescue him, the team, especially Denver (Jaime Lorente), is quite unsympathetic to his condition. This cavalier attitude to someone they consider important enough to risk everything should have been handled better. Lorente’s role and responses also seem predictable: one would expect Denver to have grown as a person. Stockholm — the most apt moniker of all — has a great arc, and Esther Acebo runs with it.
The best laid plans…
Another character that has been developed well is Tokyo. Her volatile nature notwithstanding, she attempts to do the right thing for everyone involved. However, it does not diminish her sometimes crass wit. The Professor, on the other hand, seems too far off the mark from what has been established in previous seasons. It is good to see a human side to him, grieving for Raquel. But he is also the man who cut himself and looked like a drunk vagabond to escape from the police — it would have been interesting to see more of that. Luka Peros as Marseille is the perfect sidekick, not hesitating to trade punches if it means his boss gets back on track.







In all, part four is more fast-paced and features surprises in every episode, coupled with a racy soundtrack that interestingly features English hits from the 80s. Expect a lot of frustration and yelling at the screen as well — sometimes, it feels like you are watching a horror movie where the character is doing something absolutely unnecessary. You hope they take the right decisions and don’t react based on their emotions. You hope they are around for one more heist. With rumours of a part five (yet to be confirmed by Netflix), it looks like we won’t have to sing Bella Ciao to the gang any time soon.

"Five takeaways from ‘Contagion’, in times of COVID-19 ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/five-takeaways-from-steven-soderberghs-contagion-in-times-of-covid-19/article31246307.ece,"Since the outbreak of pandemic COVID-19, Steven Soderbergh’s Contagion has been the talk of the town for its uncanny resemblance. Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet, among others, the film portrays a grim reality of how a novel deadly virus has taken over the world. It sparkles panic initially only to calm later, with a ray of hope that whatever may be the situation and how much ever time it may take, the cure will always be found.
Nearly after a decade, Contagion has found a new audience, owing to its relevance in the present-day scenario. As it continues to ride on an overwhelming popularity amongst the movie buffs, here are all the important lessons Contagion leaves you with amidst the horrors of lockdown, quarantine and isolation.
Stay away from fake news
An unquestioned assertion is as good as a truth. One will always find a way to benefit themselves in someone else’s calamities. The movie portrays just the perfect scenario where the fake news about the cure of the deadly virus which a layman discovered resulted in an increased panic at the chemists and the medical shops. At a time when the world is a witness to a chaos, one lead of a fake news can get people to their extreme behaviours. It is important to understand how news is consumed at the time of a pandemic and Contagion tells you just that.
Panic will only create problems
Panic is an incredibly catalyzing creative force, and in the movie, it is a greater cause of destruction, than the actual one. At the time where everyone is facing an apocalyptic situation, panic will spread like wildfire and lead to increase in various kind of crimes. It will be difficult to remain calm, but the movie teaches us for good that keeping your calm, taking precautions, following rules and regulations are only going to be our saviour.
Necessary precautions are the need of the hour
Prevention is better than cure. The movie explains how the virus is transmitted through human touch and surfaces like elevator buttons, switches, doorknobs. “An average person touches their face about 2000-3000 times every day and in between they touch doorknobs, water fountains and each other,” says Dr Erin in the movie. If preventive measures are provided by the medicos, then there is no reason to not follow it. Everyone wants to be safe and healthy at these times and there is nothing better than taking precautions as the situation can worsen at any given moment.
Have trust in the medical experts
Doctors are angels wearing coats and scrubs. The movie shows the naïve side of humans and how in the times of mayhem, people believe anything and everything which appears to be helping the case out. It is essential to have faith on the medical experts, because no one can understand the aftermath of health hazards like them. There might be a delay but only they can give foolproof solutions for it. Now when the world is facing a similar situation, we should trust them because they’re only working to save us.
Health is wealth
Health is hearty, health is harmony, health is happiness. There is nothing bigger and wiser than taking care of your own health. The medicos will state the precautions, the government will imply rules and regulations but at the end you will have to follow them for making the best out of it.
With a hard-hitting concept and message, Contagion will undeniably leave you thinking!

Hap and Leonard







Short lived it may be, with only three seasons (six episodes each) but this drama subverts the usual buddy adventure trope. The Wire’s Michael Kenneth Williams as a black gay Vietnam veteran teams up with James Purefoy, a working class labourer. Not only does the show twist heteronormative stereotypes, but it comes alive with the cheeky camaraderie of its protagonists and their hare-brained ideas.

Lodge 49







Cancelled too soon for its cerebral premise that nonetheless garnered a cult following, Lodge 49 only lasted for two seasons. The AMC network show centres round an off-beat eternally optimistic ex-surfer finding his place in the world when he chances upon a fraternal club known as the Order of the Lynx that opens up opportunities our protagonist doesn’t even know he’s in dire need of.

Godless







Starring Merrit Wever (Unbelievable), this Western miniseries circles on a town, La Belle without men who have died in a mining accident.

Enlightened







Another short-lived gem cancelled before its time, Enlightened stars Laura Dern over three seasons, as a woman grappling with her mental health.

Watch Dern give a performance of a lifetime with the sincerity of truly becoming the character she plays.

The Righteous Gemstones







Comedian Danny McBride returns to the small screen with the spit take humour that might just leave you choking. After Vice Principals, McBride stars as the oldest Gemstone, part of a family of evangelists with less than stellar private lives. Expect plenty of male nudity, awkward comedy and out-of-this-world consequences to run-of-the-mill situations. Class McBride humour for these dark times.

Work in Progress







Partly based on comedian Abby McEnany’s life, the show deals with an unstable, depressed and suicidal 45-year-old lesbian struggling through life. A self-identified “fat dyke”, Abby deals with everything from homophobia, finding love after 40, mental health and plenty of misadventures that are tragic for her but hilarious for us to witness.

Aaditi Pohankar on her Netflix series 'She' and working with Imtiaz Ali,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actress-aaditi-pohankar-talks-about-her-recent-netflix-series-she/article31245123.ece,"Aaditi Pohankar’s phone hasn’t stopped buzzing. After the release of her first Netflix series, She, praise and congratulatory messages are pouring in from around the globe, she says. 
“I am so overwhelmed. Finally, the thing that I worked so hard on for months is out for people to see and they are liking it. This feeling is incomparable,” says the 25-year-old. Aaditi portrays the role of Bhumika Pardesi, a timid cop who explores her sexuality when she disguises herself as a sex worker for a mission to expose a drug lord in Mumbai. The series has been written and co-directed by Imtiaz Ali.
“Imtiaz has written the characters so well, that I could easily understand the nuances of Bhumika as a sex worker and as a cop. While she is in her uniform, she is restricted and speaks in a very timid way. But as a sex worker she is free and wild,” she says.
Working with the famed director was a dream-come-true for Aaditi, who met him at the screening of Laila Majnu almost two years ago. “I was just a movie old when I met Imtiaz. I sent him a showreel that I had shot in Goa. Imtiaz watched it and invited me to meet him. He narrated the character of Bhumika to me and called me to do a screen test, and in a week I got the confirmation for the series. At that time, I knew that she played an important role in the series but I was unaware she is the protagonist,” adds the actor.
She went on shoot last year in November, but before that, Aaditi spent months preparing with reading sessions with Imtiaz and co-actor Vijay Varma. “I am a very observant person, so when I had to play a Marathi cop, I brought into play all those years I had watched cops at bus stops and traffic signals. I am not one who watches movies to prepare for my role, I would rather look at real-life personalities. My Marathi lineage made it easier for me to adopt the accent that Bhumika has,” she adds.
Born and raised in Mumbai, Aaditi wanted to be an athlete. “I come from a family of Hindustani classical musicians, but my dad was a sportsperson. Everyone in my house was an art enthusiast, so the dinner table conversations always revolved around Vijay Tendulkar or Anton Chekhov. It was in my school that I was drawn to theatre, and by Class X, I had started working with Satyadev Dubey and Makarand Deshpande,” she adds.
Aaditi made her film début with a Marathi movie titled Lai Bhaari opposite Riteish Deshmukh. Currently, the actress is waiting for the release of her next web series Ashram by Prakash Jha that is slated to release this May.",movies

Bharat Biotech set to develop and test vaccine for COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/bharat-biotech-set-to-develop-and-test-vaccine-for-covid-19/article31244845.ece,"Bharat Biotech is getting into development and testing of a vaccine against COVID-19 called CoroFlu as part of an international collaboration of virologists and vaccine makers.
CoroFlu is a one drop COVID-19 nasal vaccine built on a flu vaccine “backbone” that has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in humans, in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, the Hyderabad-headquartered vaccine maker said.
Announcing that ‘CoroFlu’ is under development, a statement from the company on Friday said the product is part of an international collaboration of virologists at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and vaccine companies FluGen along with Bharat Biotech.
CoroFlu will build on the backbone of FluGen's flu vaccine candidate known as M2SR. Based on an invention by UW-Madison virologists and FluGen co-founders Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Gabriele Neumann, M2SR is a self-limiting version of the influenza virus that induces an immune response against the flu. Kawaoka’s lab will insert gene sequences from SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, into M2SR so that the new vaccine will also induce immunity against the coronavirus.
Head of Business Development at Bharat Biotech Raches Ella said “Bharat Biotech will manufacture the vaccine, conduct clinical trials and prepare to produce almost 300 million doses of vaccine for global distribution. Under the collaboration agreement, FluGen will transfer its existing manufacturing processes to Bharat Biotech to enable the company to scale up production and produce the vaccine for clinical trials.
Refinement of the CoroFlu vaccine concept and testing in laboratory animal models at UW–Madison is expected to take three to six months. Bharat Biotech will then begin production scale-up for safety and efficacy testing in humans. CoroFlu could be in human clinical trials by the fall of 2020.
Four Phase I and Phase II clinical trials involving hundreds of subjects have shown the M2SR flu vaccine to be safe and well tolerated. This safety profile, M2SR’s ability to induce a strong immune response, and the ability of influenza viruses to carry sequences of other viruses make M2SR an attractive option for rapidly developing CoroFlu as a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the release said.
“We are going to modify M2SR by adding part of the coding region for the coronavirus spike protein that the virus uses to latch onto cells and begin infection,” said Gabriele Neumann, a senior virologist in Kawaoka’s lab and co-founder of FluGen. “CoroFlu will also express the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein, which is the major influenza virus antigen, so we should get immune responses to both coronavirus and influenza,” she said.
According to the statement, M2SR is a unique form of the flu virus. It lacks a gene called M2, which restricts the virus to undergoing only a single round of replication in cells.
“The single replication means the virus can enter the cell, but it can’t leave,” says FluGen co-founder, president and CEO Paul Radspinner. “So, in essence it tricks the body into thinking it’s infected with flu, which triggers a full immune response. But since it can’t replicate further, you don’t get sick,” he said.
CoroFlu, like M2SR, will be delivered intranasally. This route of administration mimics the natural route of infection by coronavirus and influenza and activates several modes of the immune system. Intranasal delivery is more effective at inducing multiple types of immune responses than the intramuscular shots that deliver most flu vaccines, the statement said.
M2SR was developed by FluGen and includes technology exclusively licensed through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), which manages patents for UW–Madison.",science
"Training Dutee a new challenge now, says coach Ramesh",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/training-dutee-a-new-challenge-now-says-coach-ramesh/article31259654.ece," For N. Ramesh, the SAI athletics coach who gave a new direction to sprinter Dutee Chand’s career by supporting her when she was facing the IAAF ban on grounds of hyperandrogenism a few years ago, it is a new challenge to train her for the postponed Tokyo Olympic Games.
“In a way, the rescheduling of the Games is a blessing in disguise for most of the contenders, except, maybe, for those who are ageing.
“In Dutee’s case, we are already into the preparatory mode,” the 55-year-old Ramesh told The Hindu.
“The plan is to make Dutee compete in both 200m and 100m events in the run-up to the Games, but the focus will be on 100m as research, and her own inclination, suggests the shorter sprint is more suited to her,” he said.
“It is not just Dutee alone, who is being trained via mobile app. 
“The day starts at 4.30 a.m. for all the athletes scattered across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,” he said.
“I first suggest to them to do some visualisation on the day’s training session before the start, for this has been proven scientifically to have a better effect,” he said. 
How is the review done? “For example, Dutee will give me the video feedback of her set of 30m sprints with timings and, based on that, corrective measures will be suggested. Similarly, all the athletes have their own specific training modules. 
“I also tell these athletes to stay clear of any infection, improve their immunity by taking lemon, guava and also a little bit of haldi with milk,” he said. 
“When everyone’s afraid of the coronavirus threat, ‘go one step ahead with care and dare’ is my message to the athletes,” he said. ",other sports

‘Ladies Up’ on Netflix: A much-needed win for women’s comedy in India,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ladies-up-a-much-needed-win-for-womens-comedy-in-india/article31256433.ece,"Over the last week, Netflix India’s all-female stand-up special Ladies Up has been the talk of the town — and for good reason. Starring Comicstaan alumni Prashasti Singh and Supriya Joshi, Queens of Comedy winner Niveditha Prakasam, and the most experienced performer of the lot, improv artist and actor Kaneez Surka, the show has struck a chord with watchers across the country.
With an aim to change perception, the special, which is a collection of four 15-odd minute sets by the women, doesn’t stick to a constant unifying theme or agenda, as the topics keep shifting: everything from Tinder hook-ups and casual sex to comedy in Tamil cinema and body positivity is on the table.
However, it’s the interactive ability of the performers that truly make the show sparkle, and makes it a milestone for women’s comedy in India, with the promise of more to come. Talking to us from the confines of their quarantine (like the rest of us), here are the four talented artistes on what Ladies Up means to stand-up in India, the background behind their humour, and how the community of comics in India are reacting to the coronavirus lockdown.
Kaneez Surka







I think my set on the show is a reflection of who I am and where I come from; with all its context and background. 
Though I’ve done a lot of improv comedy and acted in shows over the years, my experience with stand-up was always on the side. It’s an art form I started taking seriously only recently, so in many ways, Ladies Up is quite a new adventure for me.
I focus on a lot of themes during my bit, and one in particular involves me wanting to become a mom — however, now that I’m stuck in quarantine, I might be reconsidering that. (laughs) It’s important for me not to pander to the audience or try too hard, but keep it relatable: that’s always been the go-to philosophy. The fact that Netflix has put this together is fantastic: here’s hoping this forges a path ahead as I’m determined to get my solo one-hour special at the end of all this!
What am I doing during quarantine? Apart from working on new material, I’ve binge-watched Sex Education that i absolutely love, and for some reason, random episodes of Shark Tank always seem to be playing in my house. 
Niveditha Prakasam







My comedy is derived a lot from my formative years as a young girl in Coimbatore and that involves movies of course. Given that Tamil films were a huge part of our culture growing up, I often found myself appalled at the humour — for instance, take the popular Angavai Sangavai scene from Sivaji? I was shocked that people found it funny!
Having said that, I also know that my grasp over Tamil is limited — so it’s not in my intention to try to change the comedy scene down south. However, I do believe that I can represent the culture on a larger platform; for instance I’ve had a lot of people from the US or other countries abroad tell me that they are happy that references from the south are finally being mentioned in mainstream comedy shows.
During this lockdown, the idea of live streaming shows or going on Instagram live sounds interesting, but a huge part of what I do depends on my interaction with the audience —in fact that’s one of the biggest wins a stand-up comic thrives on. I’m not sure it’s quite that easy to pull it off, but I’m mulling over it. 
Prashasti Singh







My inspiration comes purely from anecdotes from my personal life and on this set, it revolves quite a bit around my painful dating exploits —the more painful they are, the more content they provide!
The process of preparing for a set like this is quite intense: testing the jokes with open mics, finding two among ten that work, further workshopping it and then fine-tuning it to be delivered. I also pay a lot of attention to the frequency of the jokes, how long the set-up for a punch line needs to be, and so on. However, there is no point in sticking to a formula nor do the jokes have any agenda — that’s the best way to make sure it connects with the audience.
We are all getting through the quarantine and figuring out if an online act would click. Of course, even on Instagram Live, the boys who hit on me are terribly young and end up calling me ‘Didi’.. hey, I even got a situation-appropriate line: Corona ke time pe masti karona?
Supriya Joshi 







The thing about Ladies Up is that it dismantles all these silly stereotypes about women’s humour — that they all make the same jokes and can’t find unique topics. Here you have four different women, from various backgrounds, and talking about completely different things. It’s a great step forward for women’s comedy. 
In a way, maybe it’s good that the show released during the lockdown and can be a light-hearted, quick watch for everyone stuck in quarantine. The essence of my segment, is to really focus on self-love and mental health, while not losing sight of who you are and how it’s important to understand that there are different definitions of beauty. I hope it resonates with women out there.
A lot of interesting collaborations are being planned in the comic community in India during this quarantine period, and we are definitely planning on releasing something soon.

Gunga’s sneaky play,https://www.thehindu.com/society/gungas-sneaky-play/article31246222.ece,"Today’s deal was played recently in China. South was a Chinese expert known by his nickname — Gunga. As we’ve said before, the popularity of Multi Two Diamonds, where all weak two-bids are opened with a bid of two diamonds, has the world looking for other possible uses for opening bids of two hearts and two spades. The result on this deal is not likely to garner support for this particular use.
Gunga gave up on spades, knowing that West had five of them, and made the practical bid of four hearts. He played the queen from dummy on the opening club lead and ruffed East’s ace. Knowing that West held five spades, almost certainly headed by the king, Gunga made a spectacular deceptive play — he led the seven of spades from his hand! Poor West had no idea what was happening and innocently played low. West was crestfallen when dummy’s eight held the trick.
Gunga discarded his diamond on the king of clubs and led a heart to his queen. When that held, he cashed the ace of hearts. This drew all of the enemy trumps and there was still one trump left in dummy. Gunga used it to take a ruffing finesse against West’s king of spades and ended up taking all 13 tricks!

Lockdown diary: An imaginary take on everyday life during COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/society/lockdown-diary-an-imaginary-take-on-everyday-life-during-covid-19/article31255120.ece,"Day 1 
Modi ji has announced all-India lockdown till mid-April. I can’t believe it. I guess the Mehtas will no longer have that exclusive invite-only salon they were planning in early April. I even had my outfit planned out.
Called yoga-ma’am. Am requesting her to take some online Zoom classes. I mean you can’t look like a cow at the end of the lockdown.
Called cook and asked what we need by way of supplies. Thankfully, we are set for now. Checked alcohol supplies. Adequate for three weeks. I wonder if Spencer’s online delivers tonic water for the gin?
Day 2
This feels a bit like a DIY picnic just with a virus lurking outside. I am almost enjoying putting up pictures of our meals online. I have thought of a hashtag. #CoronaEats. Planning new things to cook. I wonder if you could make pesto with basil and mixed cocktail nuts instead of pine nuts.
Spencers will not deliver tonic water. Looks like Spencer’s is struggling to deliver anything. Coined new hashtag #CoronaryAttack.
Had a cocktail. Have not been around this much family for this long.
Day 3 
Not enjoying the menu planning so much anymore. No more omelettes for breakfast. Toast and jam will do fine. Made the kids put down their phones, sit down and play cards with us. Had forgotten how to play Screw and Go Fish but realised I still don’t like to lose.
Opened the second-last packet of tortilla chips. Tomorrow we will play Ludo if we can find the board.
Realised drinks may not last three weeks. Rationing down to chhota peg. Worried I might need to drink Old Monk or that strange Sikkimese wine. Tonic water is finished
Day 4
Repeat of Day 3. 
Day 5
Made aloo and beans sabzi. Discovered a packet of curry mix someone had brought back from trip to Malaysia. We will have Penang paneer curry for dinner tonight.
Have swept house and mopped floor. Now I realise why Jamuna skips the corners under the sofas when she mops. Family rallying around a little less. Everyone seems to vanish during dishwashing time.
Apples are going bad. Need to finish them. Looked up apple recipes. 
Chatted on WhatsApp video call with school friends. Wondered if we know someone high up in the government who can get us vehicle exemption passs
Day 6
A delivery man showed up today. Have never been so excited to see a delivery person before. He did not have half the things I’d ordered but never mind, it was exciting to just see him there. 
Got newspaper too. Sunned it first. Society pages have gone down to nothing. No parties, no premieres, no art openings. Just the comic strips. 
Cancelled summer vacation plans. Friend sent good joke showing the new subway map connecting bedroom to kitchen to bathroom to terrace to second bathroom to living room.
Nodded at neighbor from balcony. Shared stories about maids who cannot come to work.
TV soap showing reruns. Back to when main lead still had her memory.
Day 7
Washing machine is running a leak. Is this covered under emergency services? Who knows these things? Fried up readymade afternoon potato snacks. Then decided that with a little tomato cucumber salad, this could be turned into a light dinner. Snacks cancelled.
Understanding allure of one-pot meals and why maid’s face falls when she sees the dishes piled in the sink. Have decided that since no one is coming to the house, we do not need to sweep every day.
Reduced to rationing cigarettes. Had to start with a small peg today. Out of mixers. 
Day 8
If you heat the water first, rum and water tastes almost OK. Spent afternoon bird watching from verandah. Signed up for online yoga class. 
Heard PM might speak again. Terrified of what he might say next.
Watching Ramayana on Doordarshan. How did we once watch it every week? But this is all starting to feel a bit like Yesterday Once More — the whole family at home, evening games of Ludo and Uno, Doordarshan and Ramayana. Makes one nostalgic.
Almost brought out the old family album. Is hairdressing included under exempt services?
Day 9
 Am hearing rumors the lockdown will be extended. Need conditioner for hair and mixers for the drinks. Mulling starting on that bottle of tourist alcohol with scorpion suspended inside it. How bad can it be? Wish I had some decent cola to wash it down with.
 Will need to have drinks every other day, I think. How many days till April 14? What day is it today?
In another part of India
Day 1 
No job. Cannot afford rent. Rushed to train station. State borders closed.
Day 2

Isolation and mental health: the psychological impact of lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/isolation-and-mental-health-the-psychological-impact-of-lockdown/article31237956.ece,"It is past noon and Mehtaj, 39, a teacher in Assam, is doing her “second round of disinfection”. Wiping her car keys with antiseptic, she says, “I can’t stop thinking about coronavirus and whether we’ve let it in by mistake. I am petrified.”
The teacher and mother of one is not alone in her phobic reaction. The isolation and fear in this lockdown era is driving an escalating nervousness among many people. Not just those with pre-existing conditions like anxiety, depression and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), but also the elderly who are struggling with new levels of loneliness and helplessness.
“I try not to read all the WhatsApp forwards,” says Mehtaj, even as she obsessively continues to disinfect door knobs, furniture and kitchen appliances. “I wash my son’s toys in Dettol; I put everything in the sun, even vegetables and groceries.” As this goes to press, 16 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Assam.
In her apartment in east Bengaluru, Saroja Chakravarty, 84, lives alone. She has kept herself busy with cooking, cleaning and Netflix. She talks to her daughters over the phone. “But I haven’t stepped out of the front door in days,” she says. As susceptible as the elderly are to COVID-19, people like Chakravarty are also acutely psychologically vulnerable at this time. “I miss talking to real people. I miss my walks,” she says.
Topsy-turvy times
“These are strange times,” says Pratima Murthy, head of department, psychiatry, at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru. “What we generally prescribe for the elderly is social interaction for their emotional wellbeing. And now they’ve been told the opposite: to physically distance themselves, even from their grandchildren.”

As you grow older, says Dr. Murthy, a routine becomes important and any disruption leads to anxiety. In Hyderabad, Zubair Ahmed, 71, and his wife Rahima, 65, find the comfort they drew from their daily walks and chatting with friends all but lost. “It’s been seven years since our son left home; but it’s only now that we feel lonely,” says Ahmed.
A review published recently in Lancet, which studied literature on the psychological impact of quarantine — the separation and curtailed movement of people potentially exposed to a contagious disease — during previous epidemics such as SARS, found proof of a range of psychological conditions, from post-traumatic stress symptoms to confusion, anger, depression, stress, insomnia and emotional exhaustion. “Activating your social network, albeit remotely, is not just a key priority, but an inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety, but longer-term distress,” says the paper. Communicating, even remotely, with family and friends, is “essential,” it adds.
Invisible enemy 
 That’s what Bonoshree (name changed on request), 25, is trying to do. Diagnosed with depression two years ago, Bonoshree works in a publishing house and lives alone in Delhi. She used to walk or step out for coffee to keep her spirits up; now all that’s stopped. 
Her worried parents video-call her three times a day. “I have to create a facade to keep them from worrying. But the truth is, I am extremely lonely. I am hardly ever hungry and I can’t sleep well.” Work keeps her busy in the mornings and a friend checks up on her, “but nothing replaces human connect, you know,” she says. She has reached out to her counsellor to see her through. 
 For those with anxiety disorder, it might be worse. Bengaluru-based psychotherapist Natasha Vijay talks of one of her clients who is struggling to cope with the distress of facing this ‘invisible enemy’. The pandemic has been very hard on this woman, the psychotherapist explains, because all she hears constantly are health warnings and alerts.

Such paranoia can be prevented by communicating the right information about the pandemic, says Sanjeev Jain, professor, psychiatry, at NIMHANS. “There’s no mystery; we must encourage people to be rational in their response, rather than panic.”
While NIMHANS has set up a helpline to reach out to patients, States like Kerala have set up helplines to tele-counsel people in quarantine. The calls have been increasing: last Saturday, for instance, 7,000 calls were made, and the government has employed an army of over 700 counsellors. “People in quarantine grapple first with stigma, then anxiety about getting infected; then of course with the stress of loneliness,” says Kiran P. S., State nodal officer for the Mental Health Programme that runs the helpline.
Engaging socially
“What is important is to understand the difference between physical distancing and social distancing,” says Dr. Jain. “Distancing should not be interpreted as social or emotional disengagement. Fostering a sense of social togetherness — whether on the phone, or through acts of altruism by helping people in the neighbourhood — is essential at this time.” 
One doesn’t have to be ill to suffer during these stressful times. In Jaipur, Rubina Shah, a homemaker, is physically and mentally drowning. With her children and husband at home all day, her chores have increased manifold. “My children are five and eight; keeping them busy all day while keeping the house in order is exhausting,” she says. Shah’s husband, a PR executive, works from home and does help, but the bulk of it falls on Rubina. “I barely get any break,” she says, “It’s making me irritable.”
One of her blessings has been that her parents are within reach and she talks often to them. Others don’t have this luxury. Yet, as Bombay-based mental health expert Prakriti Poddar says, staying connected even via digital platforms becomes vital at such times. The Ahmeds are not comfortable with video calls or chats, but their son Rohan calls them three-four times a day from Bengaluru, asking if they’ve eaten, suggesting exercises for his diabetic mother, and movies on TV for the evenings. “They are praying more; it’s their way of seeking solace,” says Rohan, “But I worry. What if something goes wrong and I cannot reach them on time?”
Staying close to family, however, doesn’t mean the same for everyone. For people with dysfunctional family dynamics, such as an abusive partner or domineering parents, staying at home is a trigger for anxiety. “It has left many susceptible to relapse of clinical depression,” Kolkata-based psychologist Charvi Jain says. 
In such times of uncertainty, the only way forward is to accept that while we don’t have control over everything, there are some things we can do. Avoiding information overload from social media, avoiding speculation about the pandemic, keeping busy with activities, playing games, engaging with books, music, dance and movies — all this helps. Now is the time for those cat videos. WHO recommends focusing on positive news, like news of people recovering from the virus, to get hope. “We can take this as an opportunity,” says Dr. Poddar, “The earth is recuperating, and so can we.”

‘I am an actress who acts the part of a cook’: Madhur Jaffrey ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/i-am-an-actress-who-acts-the-part-of-a-cook-madhur-jaffrey/article31247433.ece,"I had been fretting over the prospect of interviewing Madhur Jaffrey at the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) from even before I boarded the flight early this year. The reason is shameful: my knowledge of cooking begins and ends with boiling Maggi noodles. 
What could I possibly ask the cookery legend who single-handedly changed the way the West thinks about Indian cuisine with her BBC show and cookbooks? But I had a fallback ready: Shakespeare Wallah, that deliciously decadent 1965 Merchant-Ivory film about a British theatrical company in post-Independence India for which Jaffrey won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival that year. I couldn’t wait to hear what she had to say about working with James Ivory, Ismail Merchant, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and, above all, Satyajit Ray, who had composed the film’s music.
When I see the petite lady walking towards me in the authors’ lounge at Diggi Palace hotel, I have a déjà vu moment: this is Manjula from Shakespeare Wallah — the same dangerous eyes, the same wicked half-smile — only, this time, she is dressed in an everyday salwar-kameez rather than the chic attire of the Bollywood diva she played in the film. And she declares cattily, if a bit wearily, that she will keep the interview short with “chhota chhota” replies, deflating my enthusiasm. 
A performance
The first question I ask is how she would like to define herself — as an actor, a writer, or cookery expert. Pat comes the reply: “I am an actress who acts the part of a cook.” So is there a distance between her ‘real’ self and her cooking persona? “There’s no distance as such but I am also watching myself. And it’s a kind of performance because I am really an actress.” And what about her writerly self (Jaffrey is the author not only of some 30 cookbooks but also of the delightful memoir, Climbing the Mango Trees, about growing up in a sprawling, affluent Delhi family, surrounded by sumptuous food in the final years of the Raj, and Robi Dobi: The Marvellous Adventures of an Indian Elephant, a children’s book, among others)? “Even while writing, I am trying to be as honest as I can, which is also something an actress does. Be honest and clean and clear, instinctive, intelligent — all the qualities you want in an actress, I bring to my writing too, I hope,” she says. 
Earlier that day, I had attended Jaffrey’s session, ‘Climbing the Mango Trees: Food and Memory’, with author Chandrahas Choudhury, where she had talked about how she first started cooking — out of necessity rather than passion. Once she had left the comfort of her home for London, to join the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1955, everything changed. “There is this pea-green smog that comes in at 3 o’clock and you see nothing. This was just after the War, and the food was simply awful. I was dreaming of hing jeere ki alu or bhara hua karela while having some watery cabbage mess or transparent roast beef at the canteen.” Out of desperation, she started writing letters to her mother, asking for recipes. Jaffrey tells me later: “I wasn’t taught cooking. I am self-taught through my mother’s handwritten recipes. But I must have had a good palate, although I didn’t know the word ‘palate’ at the time. I could instinctively translate a three-line recipe into a dish and through trial and error I got it right.” 
Food memories
From 1973, when Jaffrey wrote her first cookbook, An Invitation to Indian Cooking, a lot of preconceptions and misconceptions about Indian food in the West have changed, so much so that chicken tikka masala is now arguably the national dish of Britain. What is Jaffrey’s take on this? “Some people have learnt nothing, but there are many others who have read my books and their attitude to Indian food is a little different now. When I cooked on TV in England, attitudes started changing. England is filled with people with Indian blood who are hardly aware of it but I think some memory, some historical connection, stays. The show just brought back memories for them. America doesn’t have this connection. The British never liked Indians but they liked Indian food.” She adds, “I have three generations of Westerners and Indians who learnt to cook from my books and taught their children, and now those children are cooking for their children from my books. It’s very gratifying.”
Does she relate to the term, ‘foodie’, as it is used now, involving, for the most part, Instagram posts on the food one is having in fancy restaurants? Jaffrey scoffs, “That I think is being obsessed with taking pictures of food and showing off. The younger generation is very much into that little gadget you have there [pointing at my phone] and into sending around what they are doing to all their friends — it’s a new attitude that I don’t have. I don’t want to tell the world what I am eating, I just want to enjoy it.”
While we are on changing worlds, I pop the question about her Shakespeare Wallah days. Her eyes light up. She says, “I was very young, I introduced James [Ivory] and Ismail [Merchant] to each other in England, we were all friends. The initial plan was that my ex-husband, Saeed Jaffrey, and I would go back to India and start a touring theatrical company there. Jim said that was a wonderful idea for a film and we would sit and discuss it in his apartment. Then he went to India and met the Kendals, whom he wanted in his film. But what would happen to me? So Jhabvala [the story and screenplay writer] created the character of Manjula so that I could be in it as well. That’s the story. When Saeed and I were divorced, they were very angry with him, so they kicked him out.”
Like a serpent
Did she see the Silver Bear coming for her performance in Shakespeare Wallah? “No, not at all. When the award was announced, everybody was shocked since they expected Felicity Kendal to win and not me. I said, what can I do? Jim said, go apologise to Felicity. I felt great but also felt bad...,” she says, smiling mischievously. Then I get to the question I was itching to ask: how was Ray? 
“I interacted with him later in funny ways, but not during ShakespeareWallah. Jim conceptualised me as a serpent in the film and, if you notice, Manjula’s entry is always accompanied by a serpent-like music — that’s what Ray did for my character, that much I know. Much later, when Shakespeare Wallah was getting an award from the President in Delhi, I was there with my father, who was telling his friends disparagingly, ‘Iski toh hobby hain (acting is her hobby),’ as was his wont. My supposed escort turned out to be Marlon Brando, who was my hero! Brando and Ray sat on either side of me, talking to each other across me. I tried to speak but whatever I tried to say was wrong. So I told myself, chup baithi raho, inko baatein karne do (sit quietly, let them talk). I didn’t have much to say, I was so scared of them.”
After such a long reply, Jaffrey looks visibly exhausted and I try to wrap it up. “Do you still cook at home,” I ask her. “Yes. Though I would rather somebody else did it now that I am 86. But they won’t make it as well as I do.” She leaves me with an admonishment when I confess my cooking prowess: “Kyun nehi sikhti ho? Ghar mein koi sikhanewala nahi hain or you don’t want to learn? (Why don’t you learn? Don’t you have anybody to teach you at home?) You have to learn to cook some basic things, even if it is one sabzi, chawal or roti — something simple that you can enjoy. Somebody teach her.”

Youth initiative to supply ration in Bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/society/bengaluru-youngsters-have-distributed-rations-to-about-120-families/article31256283.ece,"
Four friends, in their early 20s, Mohammed Jameel, Mohammed Ouwaiz, Hussain Shabu and Shiraz, decided to take the initiative to distribute rations to families in need. They have been able to raise funds through posts on Facebook and Whatsapp. “As proof that the rations are reaching the families, we uploaded a video on Instagram,” says Jameel. They began this initiative ever since the lock-down was announced on March 24. “We cover a radius of 20 kilometres, but sometimes even beyond when someone is in need,” adds Ouwaiz. “On the first day, we delivered rations to 20 to 25 families,” says Jameel. That number has grown to include about 120 families as of today. 







“The rations include 5 kilogram rice, 5 kilogram dal, 5 kilogram wheat, 2 kilogram sugar, 1 litre oil, 5 kilogram maida, and two soaps,” says Jameel. “We do our best to deliver to the families. But it is not possible to deliver everywhere, also considering the fact that police permission needs to be obtained,” says Ouwaiz. So other volunteers step in. “With help from our friends, we were able to supply to Wilson Garden and Frazer Town,” says Jameel. 







They will now distribute rations to 100 more families. “We are doing this for the sake of humanity. Without the support of my friends and their field work we wouldn’t have come this far,” says Jameel.

Kamarajar Port to boost cargo capacity,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kamarajar-port-to-boost-cargo-capacity/article31259640.ece," Kamarajar Port Ltd. (KPL), as part of its expansion programme, has taken up several new projects involving an investment of over ₹1,000 crore, to increase its cargo-handling capacity by about 60% over the next two years.
“Currently, we have a capacity to handle 48 million tonnes of cargo per annum through eight berths,” said Sunil Paliwal, chairman and MD, KPL. 
“We will be expanding our cargo-handling capacity by 12 million tonnes by May 2020 and 18 million tonnes by 2021, respectively. With this, we will be adding three more berths and raising the total capacity to 78 million tonnes per annum,” he said.
“All the new berths will handle coal. Coal berth terminal III and IV with 18 million tonnes capacity is reserved for Tangedco,” he said.
KPL had spent almost ₹600 crore on building jetties and capital dredging, while Tangedco had spent ₹450 crore for coal berth terminal III and IV, said industry sources.
Sical’s iron ore terminal, which has been lying idle for the last few years due to the Madras High Court’s ban on handling dusty cargo, is being converted into a coal berth at a cost of ₹220 crore. Presently, the private player is putting up unloaders, material equipment and conveyor belts. It is meant to handle coal consignments of independent power producers and would be ready soon.
Meanwhile, work on Adani’s ₹800-crore container terminal second phase has commenced. It is expected to operational by October 2021. It would raise the total handling capacity to 1.4 TEUs from the present 0.8 TEUs.
KPL, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chennai Port Trust, ended FY20 by handling 31.75 million tonnes of cargo, or down 7.92%. It posted a revenue of ₹702 crore (₹707 crore).
On the export front, last year KPL handled almost two lakh vehicles through roll-on roll-off vessels and it is set to cross the two-lakh mark during FY21, a port official said.",business
Centre tweaks rules to make inactive accounts functional ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-tweaks-rules-to-make-inactive-accounts-functional/article31259624.ece,"The Finance Ministry has tweaked prevention of money laundering (PML) norms with the aim to make all inoperative accounts functional so that cash transfers by the government under the COVID-19 relief package can reach beneficiaries.
In a communique to banks, the Department of Financial Services has conveyed that in respect of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana accounts, basic savings account and small accounts, those accounts which have become inoperative due to various reasons — including non-completion of know your customer (KYC) requirements or updation — rules have been amended with an aim ‘to avoid any difficulty caused to poor people and beneficiaries of PM-GKY [Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana]’.
As a part of the PMGKY scheme, the government has decided to transfer ₹500 per month for three months to the poor and vulnerable sections of the society whose livelihood has been impacted due to the nationwide lockdown. Accounts that may have become dysfunctional due to non-operation in the account for the last two years have also been made functional.
“Please ensure that beneficiaries do not face any difficulty on this ground and are able to withdraw the money transferred to them by the government without any problems or requirement of additional documentation,” the communication said.
“Branch officials and business correspondents may be suitably instructed, along with necessary changes in the system (if required) for adherence to these guidelines,” it added.
The Finance Ministry had also requested the Home Ministry for adequate security personnel at bank branches and with the business correspondents to maintain law and order, and social distancing, in view of the higher customer footfall expected for cash withdrawals after the transfers are made. The Home Ministry, in turn, has requested the State chief secretaries to take all necessary measures to ensure smooth disbursal of funds to the beneficiaries of the PM GKY.",business
CIMA to allow students take up exams from home ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cima-to-allow-students-take-up-exams-from-home/article31257880.ece,"With the spread of COVID-19, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)’ has, for the first time, agreed to allow CIMA students to take their examination remotely at home from May 2020.
Following the COVID-19 pandemic many test centres have been closed, preventing the delivery of CIMA objective tests and case study examinations to students around the world. 
The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, the unified voice of CIMA and the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), has been working to come up with a testing solution since the beginning of the pandemic. 
This move will enable students to continue to progress with their journeys to become Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation holders and increase the pool of management accountants.
Stephen Flatman, vice-president examinations – management accounting at the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, said, “We are living in unprecedented times and over the past weeks we have seen, rightly so, the majority of test centres close around the world to ensure everyone’s safety and well-being.”
“As a result, our students have had their studies interrupted and were prevented from taking their exams. We are happy to share the good news today that CIMA students will be able to take their Objective Tests and Case Study examinations from their homes and with minimal disruption,” he said.
Andrew Harding, FCMA, CGMA, Chief Executive, Management Accounting at the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, said “This change of approach will help our students keep their careers moving and it will, despite the current uncertainty, benefit both the individuals and economy on the long-term.”
CIMA communicated the news to students preparing for the May Case Study examinations and will send further information to students planning to take their Objective Test exams on March 31. 
CIMA will also send follow-up communications in the coming weeks to support students as they transition towards these new arrangements. 
It said the format of the examination will not change and examinations will be delivered remotely using established testing software. The examination dates and information on how to schedule an examination will be confirmed after April 7, 2020.",business

She added that the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing restrictions have made the family’s mourning even more difficult, reports ew.com.
“I am not able to hug my parents who lost their only grandchild,” she said. “It’s hard.”
Actor Grant Gustin, who plays the grown-up version of Barry Allen and his titular alter ego, took to Instagram to pay his tribute on hearing the “devastating news”.
“Just hearing the devastating news,” Gustin wrote alongside a photo of himself, Williams, and actor Jesse L. Martin on set. 
“This picture was early in the filming of The Flash pilot episode back in 2014. I was so impressed by not only Logan’s talent but his professionalism on set. My thoughts and prayers will be with him and his family during what is I’m sure an unimaginably difficult time for them. Please keep Logan and his family in your thoughts and prayers during what has been a strange and trying time for us all. Sending love to everyone,” he added.

‘Unorthodox’ review: A spectacular story of a woman finding her voice in a deeply orthodox community,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/unorthodox-review-a-spectacular-story-of-a-woman-finding-her-voice-in-a-deeply-orthodox-community/article31257932.ece,"There’s an uneasy sense of calm that runs through Unorthodox, the mini-series that dropped on Netflix last week. The first primarily Yiddish drama to premiere on the streaming platform is loosely based on Deborah Feldman’s 2012 autobiography Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots.
It begins with Esther ‘Esty’ Shapiro (portrayed by the brilliant Shira Haas) leaving home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Hailing from the ultra-orthodox Satmar Hasidic community means having to be religious, holding back desires, even talent in fact (as you see through the four-part series) and making your husband feel ‘like a king’. And this is exactly why watching Esty (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Millie Bobby Brown’s character from Stranger Things, Eleven) is so spectacular, yet uneasy. It is like watching a bird slowly find her way out of a suffocating cage and fly away free.
Deserted by her mother at the age of three (for reasons you learn as the show unravels), she is brought up by her bubbe (grandmother), grandfather and aunt. Married in her teen years, it is but natural for Esty to be excited for her life’s next phase to begin. A new start, as she says. Despite knowing she doesn’t fit in to the community’s rigid rules, she tries. On one hand, she secretly learns the piano and yearns for her freedom, and on the other, diligently follows the ‘lessons’ on being a dutiful wife by a tutor. As she holds back tears, Esty even gets her hair shaved off in a post-wedding ritual, and is regularly (in awkward scenarios) given advice by everyone on how to conceive a child.
Unorthodox (mini-series)Director: Maria SchraderStarring: Shira Haas, Jeff Wilbusch, Amit RahavStoryline: A Jewish teenager named Esty escapes from her arranged marriage and orthodox community in Brooklyn, and moves to Berlin to be with her estranged motherNumber of episodes: 4
A year into the arranged marriage with a meek Yakov Shapiro (Amit Rahav), and she is still struggling. Difficulties in conceiving, nosy relatives, and a mama’s boy for a husband who asks for a divorce amidst family pressure, convince her to take the plunge. There’s an interesting scene where her aunt talks her down for wanting to stay with her bubbe for a few days and reminds her that it is her duty to make her husband feel like a king. Esty retorts, “Then that makes me a queen, no?”
One would expect her to run away to someplace where no one can trace her, an unfamiliar territory. But she goes to Berlin, the source of her community’s trauma. She befriends Robert (Aaron Altaras) at a cafe and the first place she visits in the city is a beach. In what is easily one of the best and moving scenes of the series, Esty is pointed in the direction of the villa where the nazis made the decision to kill Jews in concentration camps. Confused and a bit shaken, as she decides to step into the water, Esty takes off her clothes, one jacket, one sock at a time: almost like she is peeling off her layers one by one. She is finally free, and her wig goes too.
But it is not just strong characters and performances that stand out in Unorthodox. There is great attention to detail in this primarily women-led series: the director, creator, producer, costume head are all women. From the shtreimels (fur hats), payots (sidelocks), decor, architecture, to even rituals and the wedding ceremony, there is a fineness to it all. A great insight into a community (and language) that not many know of.
Esty is struggling but the thought of going back home is her driving force. She learns she is pregnant and yet, fights for a music scholarship, reaches out to her mother, and is gradually working towards some sense of normalcy. And we also get peeks into her religious upbringing spilling over into her own thoughts. How, for instance, she tells a doctor that abortion is never an option, especially for her as Jews are meant to recreate the six million they lost during the holocaust. It is beautiful to see her experience the small joys of life pictured so very effortlessly: picking a lipstick (ironically named Ecstasy), wearing jeans, going to a club, and even looking people in the eye while speaking.
The final episode brings it all together: her powerful performance at the audition, facing Yakov and his bossy cousin Moishe who come after her, and accepting her mother’s shortcomings. There are instances when you feel for Yakov, who is like a lost bird around Berlin, being pushed around by Moishe who is on his own trip. But then, like Esty says, it is too late. The last scene has her wait in a cafe for Robert and his friends, and it all comes full circle, for it was a cafe where she first met Robert and the journey in Berlin began.

PVR to explore social distancing in its theatres after lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pvr-to-explore-social-distancing-in-its-theatres-after-lockdown/article31257500.ece,"PVR, the largest theatre chain in India, is looking at seat distancing in its halls as one of the out of the box ways to ensure audiences feel safe about returning to the movies after the coronavirus forced lockdown is over, says PVR Cinemas CEO Gautam Dutta.
 Besides introducing social distancing at the ticket booking level — saying goodbye for the moment to shared popcorn and holding hands as part of the movie watching experience — PVR will also sanitise all its theatres and train its staff, Dutta told PTI.
“We are planning a number of things, from sanitising our cinemas to coming up with a feature where we will do social distancing within the cinema. For example, if you have booked two tickets, we will leave one seat and book the next one,” he explained.
“This will be for a couple of weeks or maybe a month so people feel comfortable again,” he added.
“A lot of stuff is being done to gain back confidence and giving audiences the assurance that cinema is as safe an option as anything else. We are planning many small and big things, from training to sanitisation. We are talking to Pepsi whether we can sell only cans. I don’t how much of it will get implemented but the reality is that a lot of out of the box thinking is happening,” Dutta said. 
The company, which started in 1997, operates a cinema circuit comprising 841 screens at 176 properties in 71 cities in India and Sri Lanka, serving over 100 million viewers annually. 
This is the first time that revenues have completely dried up, Dutta said, as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe with more than a million cases and over 59,000 fatalities. India, where the disease has infected more than 2,900 people and claimed at least 68 lives, has been under a three-week nationwide lockdown since March 24.
He explained that the group had taken a voluntary decision to close the theatres even before the government’s notification: “Never in our history of 21 long years have cinemas closed down fully. Like any other business, we have gone through ups and downs in terms of revenues but we had never imagined our revenue will read zero. And it’s not just us, world over content releases have got impacted. Overall, it’s a very tough situation.”
Dutta also expressed the hope that businesses, including cinemas, will slowly get back to normal after the lockdown is lifted. He says, “People at the senior level in the company had decided to voluntarily take a pay cut to insulate the minimum wage staff. The first call we took, and it happened organically, was that every leader raised their hands and said time has come to make a contribution. So we took a 50 per cent cut on managerial positions. We also insulated our minimum wage staff. Technically, there have been no salary cuts, no retrenchments at the cinema level so far.”
 But the situation is changing, Dutta cautioned.
“This is not something that is mandated throughout because we really don’t know how widespread this problem is and when do we get to open the cinemas. If the lockdown situation is better and we are in a position to start opening cinemas, we will stay with that stand,” he added.
 In his view, nobody will lose jobs even if the problem stays for the next couple of months. However, there could be salary cuts along the way because it is a big team,and he added that the situation would be assessed after the lockdown is over.
There is a fear that people may not return to theatres immediately and many may even stop going to the cinemas completely, as they switch to streaming platforms: should mutilplexes be concerned?
“If anything, streaming platforms up the appetite for content. On the last day of operation before the lockdown came into effect, two lakh people streamed into PVR cinemas across the country with only 50 per cent of theatres operational at the time. People who are sitting at home will give an arm or leg to get out of their homes. We are social beings and like to go out. We don’t say we are in the business of cinema, we say we are in the business of out of home entertainment and it will thrive, not now, not later, but always,” Dutta replied. ",movies
'Sethum Aayiram Pon' movie review: Existing between life and death,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sethum-aayiram-pon-review-existing-between-life-and-death/article31257366.ece,"Death seemingly rents the air in Sethum Aayiram Pon.
It is an odd time to be watching Anand Ravichandran’s debut feature given the pandemic. But how often has Tamil cinema brought us a narrative that romanticises death? Do not misinterpret this: all that Sethum Aayiram Pon’s screenplay does is paint death as something not extraordinary. “Death is inevitable,” says one of the characters. When a writer is able to make that distinction about death, it frees a filmmaker to bring out the colours around what we, otherwise, have been led to believe is a grim situation.
The first 25 minutes or so of the film exploits this idea. A village elder passes away; this attracts a congregation of villagers. The camera pans around to bring us the sights and sounds of a funeral scene, which mostly isn’t presented to great detail in Tamil films. There are the folk artists, the oppari singers, the people who apply make-up to the cadaver before dressing them up. The detail isn’t too deep except for where the oppari portion is involved. The closest a film has come to unearthing this rural flavour in a funeral situation would be Dharma Durai (2016) with its ‘Makka Kalanguthappa’ song.
But deaths keep happening around Meera aka Kunjamma (Nivedhithaa Sathish with a measured performance), a city-bred make-up artiste, as she grudgingly goes to a hamlet, Aappanoor (whose inhabitants speak a typical south Tamil Nadu dialect), to meet her grandmother, Krishnaveni (known as the oppari kizhavi to fellow villagers). Meera hates Krishnaveni with a vengeance. We learn the cause for resentment later although the scene that leads to a change of heart in Meera leaves much to be desired. In all of the change-of-heart instances in Tamil cinema, this one ranks among the weakest and simplest.

But that is not what we are here to dwell on. Krishnaveni wanted Meera to come home; in fact, she may have conjured up a pretext to get her granddaughter home. When she tricks Meera into staying for a few extra days, the story starts to flow. What drives it is oppari, the dying art form, and Anand does justice in giving it the platform that so often mainstream filmmakers shy away from doing.
Oppari works on wordplay. The best instance is when the village’s big shot dies of a heart attack while he is in the bed with his mistress. The resulting lament is hilarious, as was the lead-up into the scene that glorifies his manhood. 
This is not to say that the film is without it flaws. Perhaps, Anand could have used a complex storytelling format because what we get is too simple. If this simplicity is what he preferred at the outset, he could have spent more time developing the relationship between Meera and Krishnavenim, adding layers to them that a viewer might eagerly want to unwraps for oneself, or even dwell a little bit more on letting oppari drive the narrative. The lack of such minor complexities does lend the feeling of an under-cooked broth to the story.
One has to assume that the title is the director’s take on the old Tamil saying: ‘Yaanai irunthaalum aayiram pon, iranthaalum aayiram pon’ (meaning: an elephant is worth a thousand gold coins dead or alive). In the film, presumably, the title stands to suggest the worth of relationships the lead character learns about, which, for her, happens only in the event of a death.
Poignant, and ironical even, considering the time we are living in.",movies
"‘The Mummy’, ‘Tintin’ and 10 other adventure films to watch during quarantine",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-mummy-tintin-and-10-other-adventure-films-to-watch-during-quarantine/article31257321.ece,"Are you going stir crazy in isolation? The Germans naturally have a word for it — fernweh which translates to such a strong desire for travel that it hurts! Before you hand out your phone number on social media like Rita Wilson, you could maybe check out these fun, swashbuckling movies, peppered with super-simplified history, anthropology, myths, mysteries, and a treasure. How does Indy crack a code that has not been solved for millennia? Because there is a B in both and also because he is Harrison Ford who you remember did the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs. Here is a list of adventure movies from the ‘80s to the noughties that would take you on a trip upon a magic swirling ship… 
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)







The adventures of archaeologist Indiana Jones, which has him haring it from Peru to Nepal and Cairo with stops at unnamed islands, the Well of Souls and occasionally a classroom, is breathlessly thrilling. The bouncing boulder still fills you with shock and awe, John Williams’ score is rousing, the Nazis are suitably wicked and the effects gobsmacking. Harrison Ford complete with bull whip and Fedora as Indy propels the movie smoothly, riding over the preposterous bits. 
Steven Spielberg followed up Raiders of the Lost Ark with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) where Sri Lanka doubled for India and Amrish Puri did much scenery chewing as the evil Mola Ram. It was difficult to digest, chilled monkey brains and all. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) brought the Nazis back, the Holy Grail and Sean Connery as Indy’s dad. The squabbles between father and son were fun and the rose-red rocks of Petra felt otherworldly. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) moved the action to the ‘50s. Cate Blanchett was lovely as the evil Russian agent, Indy finds family and there are rumours of Indiana Jones 5.
Fun fact: Writer George Lucas’s Alaskan malamute was called Indiana and was the inspiration for Chewbacca.
Romancing the Stone (1984)







Romancing the Stone directed by Robert Zemeckis and the sequel, The Jewel of the Nile (1985) directed by Lewis Teague stars Kathleen Turner as romance novelist Joan Wilder, Michael Douglas as the exotic birds smuggler Jack T. Colton (politically incorrect, I know) while Danny DeVito is the blackguard, Ralph. There is a treasure map, a quest for a fabled gem, travels to Cartagena, a greedy crocodile and assorted villains — in short all the essential ingredients for a rip-roaring ride at the movies. 
King Solomon’s Mines (1985)







There have been many adaptations of Henry Rider Haggard’s 1885 novel, King Solomon's Mines but this one used to air on telly quite often. Richard Chamberlain who took our breath away as conflicted priest Ralph de Bricassart in the mini-series, The Thorn Birds (1983) stars as swashbuckling Allan Quatermain. The film directed by J Lee Thompson also stars Sharon Stone as Jesse who hires Quatermain to find her father. There are the jewel mines, evil witches, the Queen of Sheba, a treasure, cannibals and avaricious Germans. Stone and Chamberlain reprise their roles in the sequel Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1986).
Congo (1995)







Killer gorillas, the lost city of Zinj, a rare blue diamond, the mandatory white hunter, hungry hippos, savage militia and an exploding volcano — every stereotype has been thrown into this movie based on a book by Michael Crichton. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film stars Laura Linney as Karen Ross, a former CIA operative, who leads an expedition into the Congo in search of her fiancé who goes missing after sending a cryptic message. Dylan Walsh plays Peter Elliott, a primatologist whose gorilla, Amy, communicates by converting sign language into human speech. Peter is part of the expedition as he wants to return Amy home to the Congo.
The Phantom (1996)







Though Simon Wincer’s Phantom did not get the love it deserved on release, it went on to become a cult movie on the VHS and DVD circuit. Billy Zane (yes the oily Cal from Titanic) plays the noble Ghost Who Walks in this film that brings to life all that we read of Lee Falk’s superhero in Indrajal Comics. There is the Jungle Patrol, the oath taken on the beach (for those who came in late) the skull cave behind a curtain of water and Diana Palmer, Phantom’s girlfriend. The plot involves skulls with secret powers, pirates and assorted evils including Catherine Zeta-Jones as a sky pirate! 
The Mummy (1999)







Brendan Fraser slays it as soldier-adventurer Rick O'Connell, while Rachel Weisz as Evie, the librarian who wants to show Egyptologists she is as good as them is a hoot. Arnold Vosloo is hot as the regenerating mummy Imhotep and John Hannah is Evie’s brother Jonathan who initiates the search for Hamunaptra. Directed by Stephen Sommers, The Mummy had everything from humour (remember no harm ever came out of opening a book?) to thrills and top-of-the-line special effects. The law of diminishing returns applied to the sequels, The Mummy Returns (2001) and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008). Let us not talk of the reboot in 2017 where Tom Cruise had double-pupil eyes to show his evil side.
Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)







Based on the videogame series, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, directed by Simon West, was more in the news for the digital work required to erase the tattoos on Angelina Jolie, who played the titular character. Jolie gamely plunged into her role of aristocratic adventurer strange British accent and all. The action moved from Venice to Cambodia (Angkor Wat got a lot of publicity) and Siberia. The plot involves the Illuminati, ancient artefacts, bending space and time and William Blake’s poetry. A pre-James Bond Daniel Craig pouts prettily as Alex West, Lara’s former lover and rival adventurer. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003) directed by Jan de Bont involved Pandora’s Box with Gerard Butler providing arm candy. The 2018 reboot leeched all the fun from the series. 
National Treasure (2004)







When Nicolas Cage is not winning Oscars or riding a bike with his skull on fire, he is Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and cryptologist (adventurers are multitaskers by default) seeking lost treasure with the American Declaration of Independence for a map. Helping him in his quest is an archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), the mandatory wisecracking computer whiz. Sean Bean is the antagonist one more time while Jon Voight as Ben’s dad makes a career of parenting treasure hunters—he played Lara Croft’s father as well. The sequel, National Treasure: Book of Secrets, (2007) saw Ed Harris as the antagonist and Helen Mirren as Ben’s mum join the party.
Sahara (2005)







Though in Clive Cussler’s books Dirk Pitt has blue-green eyes, which his film avatar Matthew McConaughey does not have, Sahara directed by Breck Eisner closely follows the book it is based on including a comely doctor as Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz) and an evil French businessman Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Despite non-stop action, charming leads, environmental disaster, secret sickness and a stranded ironclad from the American Revolution filled with gold, Sahara was an expensive flop.
The Da Vinci Code (2006)







While this is not an adventure movie in the strictest sense of the word, there is a quest, the Holy Grail, conspiracies, secret societies and a professor who in the Dan Brown book, the movie is based on, is said to resemble Harrison Ford. Directed by Ron Howard, the film starred Tom Hanks and weird hair as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon. Audrey Tautou played Sophie, whose grandfather’s murder kicks off the hunt for the Grail amongst other things. Sir Ian McKellen was great fun as Grail historian Sir Leigh Teabing while Paul Bettany played the troubled assassin, Silas. The Da Vinci Code was followed by Angels and Demons (2009) with all the lovely Bernini art and equally lovely Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo. Inferno (2016) has an unstable millionaire, a deadly virus (uh oh) and Irrfan Khan as fixer Harry Sims with the best lines.
Journey to the Centre of the Earth (2008)







Brendan Fraser plays a volcanologist Trevor Anderson in this adaptation of the Jules Verne classic. There is the world in the centre of the earth with gems, dinosaurs and geysers — all jolly and in 3D. Josh Hutcherson stars as Trevor’s nephew, Sean. Shot in Iceland, which Vernians know is an important portal to go to the centre of the earth, Journey to the Centre of the Earth was directed by Eric Brevig. The sequel, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012) directed by Brad Peyton was more of the same. The little elephant was delightful. Dwayne Johnson as Sean’s stepfather and Michael Caine as Sean’s flamboyant grandfather moved things along. There was the lost city of Atlantis, Captain Nemo’s diary (in Hindi) gigantic honeybees and an exploding volcano to pep things up.
The Adventures of Tintin (2011)







Even though Steven Spielberg only heard of Hergé’s intrepid boy reporter when Raiders of the Lost Ark was compared to Tintin comics, he fell in love with the Belgian comicbook’s artwork. The Adventures of Tintin, directed by Spielberg is based on three volumes of the series — The Crab with Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham’s treasure. Even though it was disconcerting to see Captain Haddock’s (Andy Serkis) eyes and the absence of Cuthbert Calculus was disappointing, the 3D movie was faithful to the look and feel of Hergé’s work. Jamie Bell played Tintin while Daniel Craig played the dastardly pirate, Red Rackham.",movies
Focusing on developing pet projects: TS Nagabharana ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/focusing-on-developing-pet-projects-ts-nagabharana/article31256727.ece,"Filmmaker and theatre director TS Nagabharana looks at the lockdown as a time to follow up on his many projects. Nagabharana says being home-bound makes him restless as he likes to be immersed in work all the time. “A few months ago I directed a play based on Bangalore Nagarathnamma’s life, now I am working on the script for a feature film.” Nagabharana says he is working on the 18th draft of the script of Vidyasundari Bengaluru Nagarathnamma.
“I have many ideas that I had kept on the back-burner due to lack of time. Maybe this time, although unfortunate for the nation, will help me complete a few things that have been gathering dust both on book shelves and in my mind.”
Nagabharana was working on the Nagarathnamma project for four years. “Initially I thought of a feature film, when the idea of a play came up, I followed up on that as a way to spread awareness about Nagarathnamma’s values. I would like the film to reach every corner of the globe. This singer-dancer from the devadasi community worked tirelessly for the rights of women.”
Nagabharana says the film on Nagarathnamma will be in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu, and shooting will begin in the last quarter of 2020. The cast will be decided after the screenplay and dialogues are done. “The script is taking a long time because of the rigorous research involved.”
Apart from the film on Nagarathnamma, Nagabharana is using the lockdown to focus on his other pet project — a film on Nadaprabhu Kempegowda, who ruled most of the Karnataka during the Vijayanagara empire. “I have been working on a script for the last six years and the 23rd draft is ready. These weeks at home will give me the necessary time to wrap it up.”
Nagabharana has a research team to do the fact- checking. Well-known names including Pratibha Nandakumar, Sreedhar Murthy, Sreepathy Manjana Bailu and Harish meet virtually for discussions. “I am also in touch with Chidananada Murthy and Suresh Moona.”
Nagabharana has directed 36 Kannada films and more than 200 plays including Sangya Balya, Jokumaraswamy, Oedipus, Sattavara Neralu and Hayavadana. He has worked with leading theatre personalities including BV Karanth, Chandrashekhara Kambara and Girish Karnad.
Nagabharana says he is very particular about documenting his research. “For me everything has to be on record. I have the recordings of the discussions I had with Dr Rajkumar in 1993 for the film, Aakasmika and with his son, Shivarajkumar for Jenumada Jodi.”
Nagabharana is known for his meticulous research and many drafts. For Allama (2017) based on the life of thinker Allama Prabhu, the 49th draft was used. “I am making the best use of my time at home for research and writing.",movies

This comes two days after the actor had pledged assistance to the Centre and the state governments of Maharashtra, Delhi and West Bengal through his own group of companies: Kolkata Knight Riders, Red Chillies Entertainment, Meer Foundation and Red Chillies VFX. He had announced initiatives on several fronts, from providing protective equipment to healthcare workers and food to the needy to essentials to acid attack survivors.
Kolkata Knight Riders, the IPL franchise co-owned by Gauri Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla Mehta and Jay Mehta committed to contributing to the PM-CARES Fund.
Red Chillies Entertainment, owned by Gauri Khan and Shah Rukh Khan also committed to contributing to the Maharashtra CM’s Relief Fund.
KKR & Meer Foundation would be working with the West Bengal and the Maharashtra governments and contribute 50,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits for healthcare providers.
Meer Foundation, along with Ek Saath–The Earth foundation, would provide daily food requirements to over 5500 families for at least a month in Mumbai. A kitchen would also be set-up to send out 2000 freshly cooked meals everyday to help households and hospitals whose daily needs aren’t being fulfilled.
The foundation, in association with Working People’s Charter, would provide basic essentials and grocery items for at least a month to over 2,500 daily wage workers who have been identified across Delhi.
It would also provide a monthly stipend to over 100 acid attack survivors to take care of their basic needs. The survivors identified are across Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttarakhand.
“This is a start and all the members of the companies stand committed to doing further as we see across India what all is required and put our best effort going ahead,” said a statement from the actor.",movies
‘One Cut of the Dead’ review: A Tokyo zombie flick done right,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/one-cut-of-the-dead-review-a-tokyo-zombie-flick-done-right/article31255240.ece,"The real and reel come together fortuituosly in Shinichiro Ueda’s Japanese zombie comedy, One Cut of the Dead. The little-known film, made at almost zero budget, with a relatively unheard-of cast and crew, went on to become a blockbuster in its own right. The ingenuity of the cult hit of 2018, is in how cleverly self-referential it is. Meta at its very best.
About the goings-on at the shoot of a low budget zombie film in an abandoned water filtration plant, it is a celebration of independent, low budget filmmaking of its own kind and its sheer inventiveness, quirks, zest and energy. No wonder then, the film revels in its own home video feel but also doffs its hat to the grungy aesthetics of film that it’s about – a perennially on-the-move camera – among the many improvisations on the set. One Cut of the Dead demystifies cinema to a great humorous and humane effect. Freaks, undead corpses, butcherings, blood and gore and screams and shouts: all the conventions of a zombie film are there. But all with a twist.

Of course there’s a 37-minute single-take opening shot. But the biggest strength is the eccentric but likeable characters. The perfectionist director who, despite the limitation of resources, would want the 43rd take to get the “real fear” and “true shiver” out of his actress. And the emotional side-story of him and his daughter, the one who truly believes in him and is a true inheritor of his filmmaking legacy.
Telling readers, anything more about the film would be giving it away. Suffice to say that the chills, thrills, laughter and cries make the film just what the doctor has ordered to fight the moody blues in the COVID-19 times. But this is also a film whose joy and delight has to be shared in the best of company. Now if only you could do a viewing party with it; virtual if not for real.

Coronavirus: TCS uses AI for drug discovery,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/coronavirus-tcs-uses-ai-for-drug-discovery/article31257352.ece,"Scientists from TCS Innovation Labs in Hyderabad are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify new molecules which might have the potential to target specific parts of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Using new methods, they have identified 31 candidate small molecules, which may serve as inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like protease, one of the key drug targets in the fight against COVID-19.
The results have been posted in a preprint repository ChemRxiv. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals.
The genome of the novel coronavirus codes for several proteins that have crucial roles in entry of the virus into the host cell, its replication, assembly and host-pathogen interactions. Some of these proteins that help the virus perform its functions are common targets for drug developers. Among these drug targets are the spike protein, which helps the virus attach itself to the host cell and enter it, and viral proteases which help it replicate.
“The viral RNA synthesises two long polyproteins when it infects human cells via a human cell surface protein. The role of the protease protein is to cut the polyproteins to individual proteins, so that new viruses can be assembled. This is important for its replication and survival,” explains Arijit Roy from the Life Sciences Division of TCS Innovation Labs, Hyderabad, in an email to The Hindu. 
The chymotrypsin-like protease or the main protease primarily does the function of cleaving the polyprotein into proteins and the papain-like protease also aids in this process. The former was chosen as the drug target by the group for their research.
First, using a database of approximately 1.6 million drug-like small molecules from the ChEMBL database, the researchers trained the generative deep neural network model. As a second step, the network was re-trained with protease inhibitor molecules. This was done with a view to narrow the focus of the neural network on to a smaller subset of the chemical space. “We trained the system with all available protease inhibitors and asked the pre-trained model to produce more new molecules that possess the characteristics of protease inhibitors,” says Dr. Roy, who is an author of the preprint. “Finally, we checked how well these newly produced molecules can bind to the target protein — chymotrypsin-like protease of the virus.”
Starting from a space of nearly 50,000 molecules, the team has made a short list of 31 candidates. Two of the designed molecules had a high degree of similarity to Aurantiamide, a naturally occurring antiviral-compound.
“Our aim was to create new molecules which possess the characteristics of protease inhibitors. We checked, whether these molecules retain all the drug-like properties. We also checked how easily they can be synthesised. All these were part of the AI-based model,” says Dr. Roy.
Drug discovery is a complex process, needing several layers of validation before the drug may come in use. In this work, the researchers have brought down the time taken for the initial step of designing suitable candidate molecules for testing from years to just a week, reinforcing the power of AI in handling huge datasets.
“TCS has signed an MoU for collaboration with CSIR. The clinical trials will take time. The first step is the chemical synthesis and biological testing in vitro, followed by pre-clinical testing on laboratory animals,” he says.",science
Novel coronavirus can be transmitted even before symptoms show up,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/novel-coronavirus-can-be-transmitted-even-before-symptoms-show-up/article31257297.ece,"A study of seven clusters in Singapore by Vernon J. Lee and others from the Ministry of Health, Singapore, provides some evidence that virus transmission to others (resulting in infection) can happen from one to three days before a person shows symptoms. But the World Health Organization maintains that the risk of getting infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from someone with no symptoms at all of Covid19 is “very low”. And it says that it is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of the virus.
The transmission one to three days prior to onset of symptoms was seen in four clusters, while in three clusters the precise timing of transmission could not be established as the index case and the contacts lived together. The results were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
Early detection and isolation of patients and contact tracing are important to contain the spread the virus. However, the existence of presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission adds a new layer of complexity and challenge in tracing contacts.
The first cases in Singapore was confirmed on January 23, and during the period from January 23 to March 16, 243 cases were reported of which 157 were locally transmitted. Of the 157 cases of local transmission, 10 (6.4%) cases have been during the period before the person who spread the virus to others showed any symptoms and hence were presymptomatic.
This is not the first case where presymptomatic transmission has been seen.
 Looking at the serial intervals (the number of days between symptoms onsets in a primary case and a secondary case) in China, researchers had in a study suggested that 12.6% of transmission was presymptomatic.
According to Los Angeles Times, a choir practice for 150 minutes in Washington on March 10 where 60 people participated left 45 people infected with the virus; two died from COVID-19. The county health officials concluded that the “virus was transmitted through the air from one or more people without symptoms”.
Similarly, presymptomatic transmission of the virus has been documented in a nursing facility in Kind County, Washington. The results were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In this case, a healthcare provider, who showed symptoms since February 26, tested positive on March 1 and seven others, too, tested positive for the virus by March 6. An investigation by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 23 of the 76 residents tested positive for the virus on March 13. Of the 23, 13 did not have any symptoms on the date of testing. Ten of the 13 asymptomatic residents developed symptoms seven days later and hence were presymptomatic at the time of testing. 
Some cases in Singapore and other countries suggest that viral shedding can occur in the absence of symptoms and before symptom onset.
“These findings suggest that to control the pandemic it might not be enough for only persons with symptoms to limit their contact with others because persons without symptoms might transmit infection. Finally, these findings underscore the importance of physical distancing in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the avoidance of congregate settings,” the authors write.",science
‘Shutdown alone is not enough to break the chain’,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/shutdown-alone-is-not-enough-to-break-the-chain/article31257261.ece,"In an unprecedented measure, India on March 25 began a country-wide shutdown for 21 days to cut the transmission chain of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Till Wednesday, India had adopted the containment measures of screening, testing, isolating and tracing contacts. 
On March 25, The WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Shutting down population movement is buying time and reducing the pressure on health systems. But on their own, these measures will not extinguish the epidemic. The point of these actions is to enable the more precise and targeted measures that are needed to stop transmission and save lives.” Among other measures every country should take, the WHO chief said the production, capacity and availability of testing has to be ramped up, and a system to “find every suspected case at community level” has to be implemented.
Giridhara Babu, Head of the Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, in an email to The Hindu explains how the shutdown along with testing can help flatten the curve.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said 21 days of lockdown will help cut the transmission chain. Is that true?
 
Yes, it is the bare minimum period we require to be sure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a 21-day nationwide shutdown is an effort to break the chain of transmission. India’s COVID-19 fight could make or break the global war. The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days.
A lockdown for 21 days would be a great social experiment which allows physical distancing. If followed strictly, it will contribute to delayed peak and to an extent, in flattening of the curve. Lockdowns may have to get extended in the areas with high transmission. It is important to identify such areas.
India has imposed the lockdown much earlier than many countries, including China, which failed to contain the initial spread of the virus. Although it started late, the Wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days, delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3% fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later. 
Why were Wuhan and other cities under lockdown for two months?
In Wuhan, the measures started much later as compared to what India is doing. It takes that much longer when you start late. The initial outbreak of COVID-19 started in China and it was spread across before diagnoses and prreventive measures could be established. Not just China, by then the virus had spread to other countries as well.
As a result, longer lockdowns of nearly two months were required in some regions. Before the interventions, scientists estimated that each infected person passed on the coronavirus to more than two others, giving it the potential to spread rapidly. But between January 16 and 30, a period that included the first seven days of the lockdown, the virus reproduction decreased from 2.35 to 1.05. The number of new daily infections in China seems to have peaked on January 25 just two days after Wuhan was locked down.
Epidemiologists say that measures implemented during this time did work. But China’s mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. This delayed the measures to contain it.
In China, implementing the measures three weeks earlier, from the beginning of January, would have cut the number of infections to 5% of the total.
Will complete shutdown for 21 days alone be enough to break the chain? Is it right to say that shutdown only buys time?
It is right to say that shutdown not only buys time but also decreases the overall burden and delays the outbreaks in most places. Stronger containment measures done together with these mitigation measures will ensure flattening the epidemic.
Mitigation measures or shutdown alone are not enough to break the chain of emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The containment strategies include identifying all cases which are positive and identifying their contacts, too. Once identified, cases will have to be isolated, and contacts will have to be placed under quarantine.
Mitigation is a precursory measure and if containment is also not done, it is not going to help. Both need to go hand-in-hand.
Also, reviewing of States where any single case is confirmed is need of the hour. Contact tracing of all those people who might have got the infection is highly needed. Only then will India succeed in current strategies to combat COVID-19.
What then should be done during the lockdown?
Aggressive testing alone without mitigation doesn’t help in breaking the chain of transmission. Without mitigation, the spread of the infection from one person to another will happen at a faster rate. We may find a certain number of cases doubling every week, also the number of deaths. The lockdown is an opportunity for us to rapidly scale up the capacity to have enough resources to manage, isolate and provide intensive care for those who needed it. Both measures going hand-in-hand could have a reasonable effect on flattening the epidemic curve.
The revisions in testing strategy involving accredited private laboratories too could not solve the issue since only a particular number of suspected can be tested in a day. With its high population, testing everybody in India is out of the question. Therefore, we need to follow mitigation measures. I recommend the syndromic approach now, wherein we need to manage every case of fever, cough and respiratory distress as COVID-19 unless otherwise proved. Once testing is scaled up, this can get better.
Should India find all suspected cases in the community and test them, as per WHO’s recommendation?
This virus effectively hides and quickly doubles. By testing only suspect cases, we might miss many of those who are asymptomatic during screening. The best strategy is to test among the SARI (severely affected respiratory infections) admitted in the hospitals and the OPDs of these areas. Many States have not even begun testing such cases. This is part of March 23 national recommendations. Therefore, strong national and local surveillance review is needed. There is a potential to cause illness suddenly in large numbers of people. Without having an idea of the total number of cases, it would become guesswork to plan for the future management of COVID-19.
Can contact tracing, quarantining and testing of contacts of people who participated in the religious congregation in Nizammudin alone be sufficient?
Tracing such contacts, quarantining them and testing such cases are definitely most necessary but not sufficient by themselves. Wherever hot spots are present, stricter enforcement of lockdown, even beyond what is already announced is needed. There should be enforcement of active surveillance in these areas for any flu-like illness, and people should be encouraged to self-report. Other measures such as providing accurate information and building awareness in the hot spots, especially on personal hygiene, hand hygiene and cough etiquettes are necessary.",science
Update on India’s war against COVID-19 ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/update-on-indias-war-against-covid-19/article31257161.ece,"Since early March, our war against COVID-19 has been making steady progress in India. This has involved detection, protection, prevention, prescription and participation. Purposefully, private groups, industries, medical fraternity, scientists and technologists have joined hands together with the government in this war, both through financial contributions and participation by involving their R&D expertise. Government agencies such as DST, DBT (and its BIRAC), SERB, CSIR, ICMR, DMR, MHFW, DRDO, and others have announced several grants focusing on specific aspects related to this war, while the Tata Trust, WIPRO, Mahindra, the Wellcome Trust India Alliance and several multinational pharma companies have come forward in this joint effort. 
The first thing is to detect whether a person has been infected by the virus. Since COVID-19 spreads within the moist part of the inner nose and throat, one measures the temperature of the individual around his nose and face, using a thermo-screening device (as used with arriving passengers in airports, or entering buildings and factories). Better devices of greater speed, detail and accuracy, such as whole-body scanners which depict body temperatures with colour codes on a computer monitor have come about from abroad. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been offered 1,000 digital thermometers for screening, and 100 full-body scanners. 
Clearly India needs these by the thousands. This need has triggered some computer industry people in India to make such body scanners here at home, a positive step. We hope these can come about at the soonest.
Once an individual is tested positive this way, it needs to be confirmed by doing a biological test to make sure that it is coronaviral infection. Until a month ago, we needed to import kits to do this. Today, more than a dozen Indian companies (most notably by the MyLab-Serum Inst.duo which can make several lakhs of these kits a week) have made them, each certified by the national body. This has rapidly expanded the scale of reliable testing rapidly across the country. Once tested positive, the patient has to be isolated and quarantined in appropriate centres. This has been done with remarkable speed and reliability, as mentioned below.
An important way to protect oneself against the invasion by the virus is to wear a mask. We constantly hear about how these are not available or sold at exorbitant cost. The notion that it is not always necessary is wrong. As the well known infection expert Dr. Jacob John of Vellore clarifies (The Hindu, April 2), it is vital that we mask ourselves as we move about in streets, since the virus is also airborne. Towards this, even as many entrepreneurs and firms across India have started making these at affordable costs, social media such as WhatsApp show the typical jugaad ways of using a baby diaper (unused!), male banian (unused!), the pallu of a saari, or dupatta and such. Happily enough, after the government clarifications and advice on this matter, more and more people are now seen to mask themselves. TV channels are also doing a useful service by inviting experts and asking them to offer relevant advice to people who have specific questions and doubts about protection in specific individual instances. 
In this connection, a very recent piece of advice on protection has been given to people wearing glasses, (and also to eye doctors whom they consult) by my colleague Dr. Muralidhar Ramappa of the L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. He says: (1) If you wear contact lenses, switch to glasses for a while. (2) Wearing glasses may provide a layer of protection. (3) Do not skip your eye exam, but take precautions. (4) Your eye doctor may recommend some more precautions. (5) Stock up your prescribed eye medicines, if you can and (6) avoid rubbing your eyes.
In addition to what the Central and State governments and notable private hospitals (for example, Apollo, Medanta and others) have set up as isolation and quarantine centres, several private agencies have helped set up these in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Haryana, West Bengal, and helped equip them (for example, Infosys Foundation, Cyient, Skoda, Mercedez Benz, and Mahindra). These are some examples of how governments and private agencies have joined hands — as they say: We are all in this together. 
Another exciting advance towards protection (and prevention of spread) has been the large scale production of incubators, ventilators and devices to monitor the individuals who have been placed in such quarantine centres. Mahindra has successfully made ventilators in large scale at affordable prices, and DRDO has come up with a special kind of tape in order to make patient protection gowns for clinicians, nurses and paramedics. 
While the possibility of a preventive vaccine for large scale use in India is at least a year away, we need to turn to molecular and drug-based approaches, in which India has great internal expertise and teams of excellent organic and biological scientists. Rightly, the government and some drug companies have turned to them to locally prepare and use several drugs (favilavir, remdesavir, avigen and such), and also modify them using well-known methods. Indeed, the CSIR has already roped in organic chemists and bioinformatics experts who can predict the 3D structures of proteins, so as to look for potential areas on their surface to which molecules can fit (lock and key approach). I have every hope that with such team efforts, India will come out with ‘made in India’ drug molecules to overcome this killing virus. Yes, we can. 
Despite their full knowledge that millions of people have settled in cities and large towns, as daily wage labourers, far away from their families in villages, State and Central governments did not plan ahead for them, nor did they plan to reimburse their wages during the lockdown which blocked their getting back home. This led to a toss of social distancing and possible community spread. Social distancing is, alas, not in Indian culture, while herd mentality is. This could have been thought of by the social scientist advisors to the governments, and could have been avoided.
(Disclosure: it is important to note that I have chosen to highlight only some examples here. There are several more ‘unsung heroes’ across the states and the nation. I hope they will not be offended that I have ignored them.)

Lockdown triggers novel online competition for rifle and pistol shooters,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lockdown-triggers-novel-online-competition-for-rifle-and-pistol-shooters/article31265294.ece,"Amidst the global health crisis, Indian shooting is staying robust.
An online competition for rifle and pistol shooters across the country, conducted over the weekend, has opened a new avenue for efficient training.
Ved Prakash Sharma, A qualified coach and an ISSF-approved official, who got the idea from the Chinese, conducted the competitions from his base in New Delhi. About 60 shooters connected via the internet for the competition.
The shooters shot at electronic targets in their homes and computers, connected through two applications, provided live video and scores to the central module. The SIUS-Ascor scoring system gave complete details, while the live video checked on the shooters, making the whole exercise transparent and lively.
“I got this idea after reading about the criticism about the training camp for the National team at the Dr. Karni Singh Range. I decided that we should also try it. There was a good response to our effort, and we didn’t charge any entry fee,” said Ved Prakash, who invited Asian Games gold medallist Jitu Rai to inaugurate the competition from his army base in Mhow.
“We will do it bigger in the future. State competitions can be done this way, so that shooters don’t have to travel. Most of the shooters have invested in electronic targets. I am also trying to develop a software so that we have a good system,” said Ved Prakash.
“Shooters have known me for many years. I announced the competition through social media. Jitu has said that he will join the competition in future,” observed Ved Prakash. ",other sports
Boxing | Coach Bergamasco has not lost hope ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/boxing-coach-bergamasco-has-not-lost-hope/article31264824.ece,"Despite being caught between a rock and a hard place, Raffaele Bergamasco has not lost hope.
Even as Bergamasco, the foreign coach for Indian women boxers, is leading a solitary life on the campus of the Indira Gandhi Stadium in New Delhi, his heart is with his ailing wife and daughters in Italy.
With the coronavirus outbreak hitting Italy hard and spreading dangerously in India, Bergamasco has no choice but to wait for the situation to improve.
“I would like to travel back home and spend some time with my family as and when the situation improves. However, my commitment is towards Indian boxing and the boxers and till the time there is no clarity on the status of travel I would like to stay put here.
“As per the current government guidelines, if I return to Rome my visa will stand cancelled. With Olympics postponed, there is time for preparation and I hope I can visit my family once travel bans are relaxed,” Bergamasco told The Hindu.
The Italian is happy that his family is safe. “My family is fine as they live far away from the areas of major outbreak in Italy. Fortunately, today we have social media and video-call facility. I talk to them often and we also have family video chats.”
Bergamasco is worried for his wife, though. “Unfortunately, she is unwell and has been on therapy for the ast two years. I am concerned about her well-being.
“I try to talk to her often over phone and my daughters are there with her and keep me updated. 
“I had promised to my wife that I will be there with her every month, even for a day or two, during the therapy. But she understands. She is a brave lady.”
 
Bergamasco, who had a tough time during self-quarantine when he returned with the Indian side from the Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifier in Jordan, wants to continue with his current job and has been guiding the women boxers despite being in isolation. 
“I am connected to all the boxers and my team through video conference on a daily basis. I provide them with what they are supposed to train at home.
“The aim is to keep them fit so that once we resume we can take things further for our Olympic preparation,” said Bergamasco.",other sports

Limpele, appointed till the Tokyo Olympics, stepped down as doubles coach last month, becoming the fourth foreign coach to resign without completing his tenure.
Chirag said the postponement will now give them more time to deal with the departure of Limpele, who was specifically hired to prepare them for Tokyo.
“We will definitely get more time to prepare now. Since it is more than a year to go, I believe we will get a new foreign coach. If the Olympics had happened this year, we wouldn’t have got a coach for 3-4 months. But now, BAI might get one to help us,” said Chirag. 
“Now we have a year... hopefully, we will get a new coach and adjust to the new regime. So in a way, we got lucky with this postponement. If an experienced coach comes on board, it will make a big difference.”
 “We are almost there, it is a matter of 2-3 points. We are 90% there and a good coach like Rexy Mainaky (head coach of Thailand) would give us that extra 10%. A high-calibre coach can help us get into world’s top three.”

The ‘long-term’ investment trap ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/the-long-term-investment-trap/article31259677.ece,"The recent stock market crash has presumably affected your financial health. Yet, you take comfort from the typical advice that equity generates positive returns in the ‘long term.’ It is important that you make optimal decisions while managing your personal investments. 
To make such decisions, you should first ask the right questions. One such question is: can I achieve my goal if equity generates positive returns in the ‘long term’?
If you run 10 km every day, you could, perhaps, maintain your body weight or, at best, reduce your weight by, say, 5 kg. But stop running for two months and you would gain 10 kg. Notice the adverse relationship. You do not lose much weight when you run, but you gain more weight when you stop running. In other words, you have to apply more effort to achieve a positive outcome, but a negative outcome comes easily.
A similar relationship exists in the market. Suppose your equity investments declined from 100 to 75 during the recent market crash. Note that a 25% unrealised loss requires a 33% gain to recover the losses (25 upon 75). In addition, your investment has to generate positive returns to justify your decision to buy equity instead of investing in bank deposits.
You may argue that the market can gain 33% just as easily as it lost 25%. That is not necessarily true. Fear is at least twice as powerful as greed. This means that it takes less time for the market to decline than it takes for it to go up. Remember, the market rose between April 2003 and January 2008, but lost 65% in the subsequent 10 months. 
Thereafter, it took another two years to recover the losses and an additional five years to generate significant positive returns. So, the question is: Can you wait enough for your loss-making equity investments to generate positive returns?
Suppose you created a portfolio in 2010 to fund your child’s college education in 2024. What if your equity investments are down 25% in 2020? Your portfolio has to recover 33% in the next 4 years and, in addition, earn the annual expected return. Why?
Suppose you invested a fixed amount every month from 2010. 
You had determined that 8.5% compounded annual post-tax returns over 14 years will help you accumulate the money required to fund your child’s education. Based on a post-tax expected return of 10.8% (12% less 10% capital gains tax) on equity and 4.5% on bonds, you invested 65% in equity and 35% in bonds.
Then, the market crashes four years before your child is scheduled to go to college. What should you do? You cannot wait for the ‘long term’ because you need the money four years hence. Besides, you need to earn 10.8% returns every year on your equity investments to achieve your goal.
The point is this: Equity investments could recover over a long term. But you have a different time horizon. So, the question you should be asking is: are your investments likely to recover losses and generate gains in time to fund your life goal?
Thinking of equity as a long-term investment can help you reduce the emotional pain of investment losses. But that is unlikely to help you achieve your goal. What should you do? 
For one, you should continually reduce your portfolio’s equity allocation as you come closer to the time you need the money for your life goal. For another, you should have a plan to bridge any shortfall in your portfolio to meet your life goal.

Sanitise your investing habits,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/sanitise-your-investing-habits/article31259669.ece,"In troubled times such as the present one, the urge to do ‘something’ to make your money work better is high. Here are some of the questions I received frequently, reflecting the above sentiment, and my corresponding suggestions.
“I have some surplus to invest now, where should I invest for high returns?” Having some surplus does not automatically qualify it for risky, long-term investments in these hard times. 
The COVID-19 pandemic may take time to resolve; some of us may have pay cuts and worse, some may lose jobs. If that be the case, be happy that you have some surplus and earmark the same as a contingency fund. 
At least six to nine months of your expenses are best set aside in these extraordinary times. Stash much of this money in savings accounts and short-term bank deposits (of large scheduled banks) that you can break. Overnight or liquid funds should only be your next choices. Please stop bothering about the interest it earns, until such time we get over this current crisis. In other words, near-term survival and sustenance matter first.
 “Should I stop paying my EMI and use the money to invest?” No, this is not a good idea. First, there is no free moratorium. Your interest will get added over the three-month period. If you have enough money for your daily needs, avoid skipping the EMI. Second, in such a dicey market, the last thing to do would be to ride the market on borrowed money hoping the market will generate quick returns.
“[The] RBI is cutting the interest rate. Should I lock into higher-earning deposit options?” Higher earning options do not come without risk in normal times. They come with heightened risk in these risky times. Stay clear of any kind of credit risk if you are dependent on your investment for regular income. Good old small savings schemes will offer slightly better interest rates than bank FDs, especially for senior citizens, even after the recent rate cut. There are select, quality low-risk options in debt mutual funds that you can explore if you have other sources of income.
“Markets have fallen sharply. Can I buy some stocks now?” If you are a seasoned stock investor, then you might find opportunities in quality stocks that you are already invested in and accumulate those. 
If you are new to stock markets, then trying to buy when markets fall can be like catching a falling knife. Instead, add more to your mutual funds or simply use index funds or ETFs and keep accumulating in 6-8 small instalments and slowly deploy every week. Make sure this is money you don’t need for 3-5 years at least and you have enough debt allocation in place. Avoid wasting your time asking friends or even experts whether this is the correct time to buy. Nobody really knows.
“Small-caps have been hit badly. So, they may bounce back fast. Should I shift to smaller companies?” This is not the kind of correction where stocks that fall the most bounce back the highest. The present crisis will lead to a question of survival of the fittest as stressed working capital and poor sales would threaten companies with weak finances. 
Also, previous market falls have taught us that some stocks and sectors go out of fancy when a new rally starts after such major corrections. This may mean that stocks that you eyed in the earlier rally may completely lose out and fade into oblivion, at times. Unless you track smaller companies and their financial strength closely, stay with quality companies that are cash rich, are known to emerge from downturns and are currently at a double-digit discount to the prices they were in a bull market.
“All my equity investments are below my cost after 5 years of investing now. What is the point in investing in equities?”
 Social media comments on 5-year SIPs turning negative, 5-year FD returns or liquid funds being better than equity at present... are all true. But just 2.5 months ago, there would have been no case to make. Also, nobody speaks of the bounce-back that happens not far after the hit. My point is, get to know how you could have mitigated it. The answer is asset allocation. Some equity, some debt, some gold and so on. If you had done this, then please a look at your portfolio in its entirety and not just your equity. You will still be better off.
When you have asset allocation in place, an annual check will tell you whether the allocation needs to be rebalanced — that is, bringing your asset proportion back to your original allocation if an asset class swells. For example, if your 60:40 equity: debt portfolio has grown to 70:30, you need not know anything about the markets. You simply need to know your equity allocation is inflated and bring it back to 60:40. Such re-balancing will indirectly help you book profit in the inflated asset and redeploy in the deflated asset class (debt, in our example). 
This way, in steep falls, your portfolio is better protected, and you would already have reaped some profit and shifted it out, without knowing whether markets may rise or fall.
Stay safe, invest right!

Why has India reacted to declining global crude prices by raising excise duties?,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/bounty-from-oil-plunge/article31259756.ece,"The story so far: Till U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet the past week, on his conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Brent crude prices had been declining in an unprecedented manner, touching an 18-year low. Mr. Trump’s assurance that the West Asian kingdom and Russia, major oil producers, would soon announce a production cut sent prices up again. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia and Russia had fallen out on agreements to cut production which would have kept oil prices up.
Brent crude had tanked about 50% over the month of March and was trading in the region of $26 per barrel till Thursday. Prices jumped, and crude now trading at about $33 per barrel, after the U.S. President’s tweet that a production cut could be ‘as high as 15 million barrels’ per day. To set that in context, when talks on production fizzled out earlier, Saudi Arabia said it would raise its production from 9.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to 12.3 million bpd.

Centre amends law to enable excise duty increase on fuel 
Profits that companies make in selling oil depend directly on the cost of extraction, which is influenced by factors such as the terrain where the oil field is located. There is still a staggering quantity of oil in the world left to be extracted but the cost of extraction is increasing. For example, fracking, which helps extract oil from rocks, and which is a significant source for U.S. extraction firms, does not come cheap. So, a spike in production by Saudi Arabia and Russia typically drives down oil prices, following the traditional concepts of supply and demand. Beyond a certain point, U.S. producers may not be able to withstand declining oil prices, considering their costs. A January 2020 Haynes and Boone’s Oil Patch Bankruptcy Monitor report said that since 2015, when oil prices began to drop save for a few spikes in between, 208 North American producers have filed for bankruptcy involving $121.7 billion in aggregate debt.
But now, if Saudi Arabia and Russia too are considering a production cut to help bring prices back up again, it is a signal that oil prices have gone too low for even these producers to profit from. Significantly, neither of these oil producers has publicly committed to production cuts.
With the virus which originated from Wuhan in China in late 2019 bringing global economic activity to a near-complete halt, demand for fuel is bound to have dropped significantly. This would have had a dampening effect on oil prices. After all, if you do not move out for work or entertainment but only occasionally for grocery shopping, how much fuel would you burn over the period of the lockdown? Even before the virus-induced lockdown, India’s consumption of petrol by volume grew a marginal 2% in February 2020, over April 2019 and diesel consumption fell by 2.2% in the same period.
The country’s oil bill may have fallen in the recent past and could remain low if Saudi Arabia and Russia do not behave as the U.S. President expects them to, but Indian end-customers may not benefit. Indian prices of petrol and diesel have remained steady.
Between March 2014 and April 2020, the price per barrel of the Indian crude basket fell from $107 to $21. The average retail selling price of petrol in Delhi has fallen by ₹1.82 from March 2014, to ₹69.59 per litre in February 2020. Of this amount, the portion that goes to the Centre in the form of duties has more than doubled from ₹10.38 to about ₹23.
In March, the Central government reacted to declining international oil prices by raising excise duties by about Rs. 3 per litre on fuel sold in India, such that the end user saw little or no change in the retail price. This was only the latest in a series duty increases over the past few years.
Even before the virus-induced lockdown paralysed the economy, the government had been battling a fiscal deficit problem. The nearly four-year-old Goods and Services Tax has not immediately yielded robust collections; consumer demand has fallen and there have been calls to put more money in the hands of the consumer, fuelling expectation of a tax cut. The Centre could not afford a blanket cut in income tax rates but it did offer taxpayers the option of moving to a lower tax slab without deductions or rebates.
With international oil prices declining, the government has used the opportunity to keep end-user fuel prices stable while increasing its own prospects for collection. With consumer inflation being largely influenced by poorer supply of specific food items, and not necessarily by rising fuel prices, the government has chosen to keep Indian end-user fuel prices stable with higher taxes to augment its otherwise-emaciated kitty.
Before the COVID-19 lockdown was announced on March 24, there were reports that the most recent duty hike would give the Centre ₹43,000 crore for the fiscal year 2020-21.",economy
Coronavirus | How will the three-month moratorium on EMIs impact customers? ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/coronavirus-how-will-the-three-month-moratorium-on-emis-impact-customers/article31258112.ece,"The story so far: On March 27, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashed interest rates to counter the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It also announced other relief measures, which included permitting banks to provide a three-month moratorium on all term loans.
Due to economic disruptions caused by the nationwide lockdown which has led to stress in the financial position of borrowers due to cash flow mismatches, the RBI has allowed banks and financial institutions such as housing finance companies to put a three-month moratorium — March, April and May — on repayment of term loans. A home loan, a personal loan, loan against property, car loans are classified as term loans. So a customer can choose not to pay the monthly instalments for these months. The facility is also applicable for credit card dues. Opting for the moratorium is not mandatory for borrowers who can continue to pay their equated monthly instalments (EMIs).

No, EMIs are not being waived, the amount has to be paid later, after the moratorium is lifted. The interest accumulated in these three months will be added to the principal. As a result of not paying the EMI for three months, the tenure of the residual EMIs will increase. Alternatively, customers can opt to increase the amount of EMI while keeping the tenure intact.
The burden will be higher if a customer is at the beginning of the loan cycle since the principal outstanding is higher and vice- versa. (See chart)

Different bank/non-banking financial companies have offered different ways on how to apply. Some lenders have a link on their website for applying for the moratorium while some have asked customers to send an e-mail to a particular address. Some banks are also accepting physical copies of the request at their branches. It is best to visit the lender’s website to find out how to apply.
No, banks don’t have the discretion. Banks have to offer respite to any customer who wants to opt for the moratorium.
Customers need to inform the lender about it and seek reversal of the EMI. Alternatively, they can opt for a moratorium on the next two months (April and May).

How paper planes can teach you aerodynamics and geometry ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/learn-to-make-the-farthest-flying-paper-plane/article31262463.ece,"In 2012, John Collins’ paper plane ‘Suzanne’ was thrown by football player Joe Ayoob. The plane flew a distance of 226 feet and 10 inches, which led to John being declared a Guinness World Record Holder for designing and folding the farthest flying paper plane. Now high school students will get an opportunity to attend a free workshop by him, presented by Atria University. 
During a Zoom interview, John shows us his studio, and his paper planes. “This plane can circle back in either direction, and that plane looks like it is flapping its wings! That is amazing right, how does it do that?”







We have the same question: How does he go about the design process? “I wish I could tell you what the secret sauce is. But a lot of times I design a plane with a specific goal or plan.” John holds up one of his creations: the super canard and says: “This has an intentional design idea. The little wing in front helps the plane stall resistance. Sometimes you see a plane do something interesting and then you have to start investigating the aerodynamics of how the plane can do that. And then you start a little science experiment with that. You start a hypothesis on how that thing is going to work, devise an experiment, analyse results, rethink your hypothesis. It becomes this little science lab. My process of inventing planes is a lot like that. I decide what I want the plane to do so you can measure success. Did you do what you want or did you do something so interesting that you have to rewind and figure out more?
John, who has spent decades mastering the art of origami and aerodynamics, says that designing ‘Suzanne’ was intentional. 
“That was a three year process to break the distance process. It was an idea never been done before. It turned out that at The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) they were working on a similar air flow idea (used for ‘Suzanne’) for entirely different reasons. When I met them years after I had broken the record, they said 'we would like to use your model'. I explained my paper plane theory to a NASA guy! It might seem like a childlike question to ask how do paper planes fly but it is not, it is an interesting scientific question.”
John has also published books on how to make paper planes and sees them as an educational tool that helps one study aerodynamics and geometry. “I am hoping the students get interested in the broad brushstrokes of how and why things fly but more importantly get them to understand that science is not difficult. We are going to look at different kinds of designs and just do some crazy things. I am making all this happen by turning my living room into a studio because all of the public events that I was signed up to do had to be rethought.” 
Speaking about his interest in paper planes, John says, “Like most people my interest in paper planes started when I was young. It is just that I never got over it. I spent the next 50 years or so folding and making paper planes,” he says with a laugh.
Those interested in learning how to make a paper plane can register for the workshop here: https://bit.ly/2JypIc4. It will be held at 7 pm on April 5. ",science
Get set for volatility,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/get-set-for-volatility/article31259682.ece,"After an initial spike in the first week of March, precious metals fell sharply along with other asset classes in the second week. Comex gold gained 1.91% in March to settle at $1,596.6 an ounce while Comex silver fell by a whopping 13.6% to close at $14.15 an ounce.
In the domestic market, gold futures on the MCX gained 3.3% in March to settle at ₹42,956 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures slipped 10.1% in to close at ₹39,523 per kg.
As observed in the previous post, Comex gold turned weak and fell way below the target zone of $1,510-1,520. The short-term outlook for Comex gold remains weak and a slide to $1,450-1,490 appears likely. 
 From a medium-term perspective, gold price is likely to trade in the range of $1,450-1,700. Until there is a breakout from this range, a range-bound action is likely to persist.
Comex silver, too, ruled weak and hit the earlier mentioned target zone of $15.5-15.7 an ounce. The short-term outlook remains weak and a drop to $13-13.5 appears likely. The trend would remain weak until the price moves past the resistance at $16.6-17 zone.
 The short-term outlook for MCX gold futures is positive and a breakout past ₹43,800 would push the MCX gold price to the short-term target of ₹44,800-45,000. The trend would turn weak if the price falls below ₹41,500 per 10 gm.
The short-term outlook for MCX silver is positive and the price could move up to ₹42,800-43,500 range. A move past ₹41,750 would strengthen the positive view. A drop below ₹33,000 would indicate a major trend reversal and the price could then slide to far lower levels.
To summarise, precious metals achieved their short-term downside targets and have rebounded thereafter. Though there is a case for a minor bounce, especially in the domestic market, the international price of gold and silver are likely to remain volatile and range-bound.

Deepali Deshpande strikes a cautious note,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/deepali-deshpande-strikes-a-cautious-note/article31274435.ece,"India’s problem of plenty in the rifle and pistol events is likely to give selectors a headache when they sit down to select teams for the postponed Olympics. 
One primary question is whether World Championship silver medallist Anjum Moudgil will be able to retain her berth in air rifle or will the selectors instead opt for former World Champion and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Tejaswini Sawant.
“You try to give your best every time. You cannot think, ‘this is not my strong event. Let me wait and get it in my event’,” was Anjum’s counter to the question.
Anjum has shot a world record 1180 out of 1200 in the 50m rifle 3-position event, but the irony is that she could not compete in the regular team in any of the World Cups, as the team was searching for an Olympic quota which she was ineligible to win. After Sunidhi Chauhan, Gaayathri Nithyanandam and Kajal Saini failed, it was Tejaswini who nailed the Olympic quota in the 3P event. 
Olympian Deepali Deshpande, the Indian team’s high performance rifle coach, put things in perspective. “Anjum is experienced and in good form. Postponement is an advantage for her. In air rifle, 2019 was all about changing technique, equipment and getting over injury. Still she could maintain her ranking,” said Deepali. 
With Apurvi Chandela winning two World Cup gold medals it has generally been perceived that Elavenil Valarivan and Mehuli Ghosh could fight for the second spot in women’s air rifle.
“The national federation and the selection committee will be thinking a lot on these aspects. I feel that we have to be very careful as we will be working on two planes. One is 2020 Olympics being held in 2021, and the other is 2024. Some of the shooters will be front runners for 2024. If we drag them into this selection, we may lose them even for 2024,” cautioned Deepali, even as she pointed the high scores of 1170 or more of Tejaswini. “With Olympic quota points she is second to Anjum only,” she added.",other sports
"‘Looking at survival and safety’, says Pankaj Advani",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/looking-at-survival-and-safety-says-pankaj-advani/article31274355.ece,"Pankaj Advani is not worried about missing competitive cue sports action, as there are bigger issues to tackle. 
“I find it weird when sportspersons speak about their sport at this time, as we’re looking at bigger things like survival, health and safety. These things are much more important than one’s sporting career. The police, nurses, doctors and paramedics — they are our saviours. They put their lives at risk for us. I express my gratitude to all of them,” Advani told The Hindu here on Monday. 
With a contribution of ₹5 lakh to the PM-CARES Fund, Advani has done his bit in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.
“I’m not a doctor, policeman or someone who is in the front line of this battle. So this donation is the least I can do. We face a massive fight. The coronavirus has affected the entire world — people are suffering and dying,” the multiple-time World champion said.
Advani emphasised on citizens doing their bit by taking the necessary safety precautions. The 34-year-old appealed to the public not to turn occasions like ‘diya’ lighting into celebratory affairs.
“I request everyone to keep distance, stay indoors, wash your hands and wear a mask whenever you go out. We tend to make a ‘mela’ out of the directions given by the government. 
“Lighting a ‘diya’ and clapping for our health workers is good, but we should do it sensibly. 
“We should not make an event out of it by bursting crackers and so on. Indians are social people in general, but all socialising must wait. Religious gatherings and other functions must wait,” Advani said. 
Advani believes that an extended lockdown would be the right way to go. 
“In my opinion, the lockdown should be extended beyond April 14, but of course the government is best placed to take this decision. 
“It would also be nice if the government regularly provides numbers and statistics related to the coronavirus. That will help us understand where we’re headed,” he said. 
Advani, who lives with his mother, is finding ways to keep himself occupied. “I’m exercising, though I’m not very regular. 
“I’m also helping with household chores like cleaning, dusting and so on. It makes me appreciate the efforts of everyone who works for us at home,” he said.",other sports
WFI may hold fresh trials for Olympic qualifiers ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wfi-may-hold-fresh-trails-for-olympic-qualifiers/article31271266.ece,"The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) may hold fresh trials to complete the selection process before the start of Asian and World qualifying tournaments, said its secretary V.N. Prasood here on Monday.
The WFI was mulling this move in the wake of postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the subsequent cancellation of qualifying tournaments due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Prasood said the federation will either conduct fresh trials or may advance the 2020 National championships to complete the selection process before the start of the qualifying Asian and World tournaments.
However, he added that the final decision will be taken after the United World Wrestling (UWW) releases a fresh schedule for these events.
Plans upset
“Right now everything is in a flux. The postponement of Tokyo Olympics to next year has upset our plans. Our policy is to select the best and deserving wrestlers. But we want to make sure everyone is given a chance. We may conduct fresh trials in all events and if that is not acceptable by the wrestlers, we may even hold the National championships a little earlier this year.
“But our schedule will depend on the international calendar. We have to see if UWW will hold the World championships before the qualifying events. Normally UWW doesn’t include Olympic events in world meets held in the Olympic year. But it is a different scenario now, so we have to wait and watch,” said Prasood.
Four Indians — Ravi Kumar Dahiya (57kg), Bajrang Punia (65kg), Deepak Punia (86kg) and Vinesh Phogat (53kg) — had qualified for the freestyle events for the 2020 Olympics after winning medals in the 2019 World championships.
Prasood is hopeful that more Indians will qualify for the Olympics from the qualifying events.
End of the ban
The postponement of the Olympics has come as a blessing for Commonwealth Games gold medallist Narsingh Yadav, who will complete his four-year ban this July.
Prasood added WFI has kept its doors open for Narsingh. “His ban will be over in July and there are no obstacles in front of him to return back to competition. If he is in good shape he can compete and win back his place in the team for Olympics.”",other sports
"Today’s cache | Duo uses AI to improve calls, and more",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/todays-cache-duo-uses-ai-to-improve-calls-and-more/article31273477.ece,"Google Duo is using AI technology from DeepMind to enhance call quality to fill gaps in transmission losses. In the US, Tesla’s engineers are using car parts to build ventilators for COVID-19 patients.
Beware of COVID-19 malwares that will affect your PC and rewrite your master boot record (MBR). 
YouTube is building a short-video sharing product to rival TikTok. And finally, parents and kids are using productivity apps to complete office and school tasks. 
Google’s Duo uses DeepMind’s technology to improve audio quality
Ever faced a transmission problem while making a call on Duo? You might have missed hearing a few words from the other end, or if it was a video call, the image might have frozen during the call. 
To transmit a call over the Internet, speech data is cut into small chunks called packets. Those parts travel through the Internet, and are then rearranged at the receiver’s end. 
An efficient audio call over the Internet depends on the pieces rearranging perfectly, so the receiver gets the complete message.
But most often, these chunks either arrive in the wrong order, time or simply get lost during transmission, causing ‘jitter’ in communication. This is a pervasive problem in both audio and video calls. 
About 99% of Google Duo calls have to deal with pack losses, excessive jitter or network delays, according to Google AI blog post. 
Of those calls, 20% lose more than 3% of the total audio duration due to network issues, and 10% of calls lose more than 8%, it said. 
To solve this issue in Duo, Google is using DeepMind’s WaveNetEQ technology.
WaveNetEQ is a self-learning progamme that is trained with a large corpus of speech data. It uses that information to fill in the missing places to give a coherent call.
And as calls on Duo are end-to-end encrypted, the processing happens on the phone.
Google claims that the programme is fast enough to run on a phone, while still providing state-of-art audio quality than other systems currently in use.
Tesla reveals its ventilator powered by Model 3
In March, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted that his company was willing to make the much-need ventilators to help COVID-19 affected patients.
The next day, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the tweet, saying the US is facing a drastic shortage of ventilators, and that “We could use your help!”
On Sunday, Tesla shared an update on the progress in a new video post in the company’s YouTube channel. In it, the engineers showed prototypes of ventilators that were made using Tesla car parts.
In the video, a Tesla engineer explains, using a flowchart diagram, how the ventilator works, while highlighting car parts (coloured in orange) used to build it.
Then, another engineer, reveals a prototype built by the company, followed by the back-end data analysis on how the machine captures patient’s pressure, heart-rate, and other health metric.
“But there is still a lot of work to do,” said on Tesla employee. 
“We’re giving our best effort to help people out there.”
Apart from Tesla, Ford and General Motors are working on building ventilators. Ford is working with General Electric’s health care division to make a simplified version of its current ventilator.
GM has partnered with Ventec life Systems to push up the production of the life-saving machine.
YouTube is developing a rival to TikTok
Google-owned YouTube is a planning to develop a short video feature that will allow users to create and upload their own videos, according to The Information. 
The new feature, which will be part of the YouTube app, will be launched by the end of 2020, the report said, citing two unnamed sources. 
YouTube’s answer to TikTok is called ‘Shorts,’ and it will allow users to pick music from the video streaming company’s catalog of licensed music.
The songs from YouTube app can be used as soundtrack for videos created by users, the report said.
YouTube has declined to comment on the new feature.
According to recent interview with NBC News, YouTube’s chief executive Susan Wojcicki acknowledged that the company was exploring the shorter-form video features.
""We actually have introduced stories on YouTube and we've actually seen our creators really engage with the stories,"" she said in an interview to Byers Market Podcast that will be aired later this month.
""That would be an example of really short-form content. So, we will definitely continue to innovate in all the different format sizes, including really short-form video.”
TikTok’s rise has been closely watched by social media giants in the Silicon Valley.
TikTok has come under increased scrutiny in the US after lawmakers argued that the China-based social media platform could pose a national security threat.
But that hasn’t deterred the growth of the platform. It was the most-downloaded app last year with over 700 million downloads.
The short-video sharing app recently set up its new content advisory council, saying the panel of security and tech experts will help shape policies for the platform.
A COVID-19 malware can wipe your PC
At least five malware strains have been identified by the infosec community, ZDNet reported.
These have the potential to destroy infected systems by removing files from the PC or rewriting the computer’s master boot record (MBR).
Some of these malwares are out in the wild, while others seem to have been created for fun or test.
All of these are driven to destroy, and have coronavirus themes. They don’t appear have any financial interest.
One of the malwares uses the COVID-19.exe name. It infects the computer in two stages.
First, it shows a window that can’t be closed as the malware has disabled the Windows Task Manager.
And as the user attempts to close the window, the malware rewrites the MBR in background.
After rewriting MBR, the malware restarts the computer with a new MBR. The new record blocks the user and sends them back to pre-boot screen.
The only way users can gain access to their PCs is with the help of apps that can recover and rebuild MBR to a working state.
Parents and kids are using productivity apps during coronavirus home-schooling
As most schools are shut globally to reduce the spread of COVID-19, some parents are using productivity software to make their children complete learning tasks while they are at home, MIT Technology Review reported.
Apps such as Trello and Asana, which were confined to workplaces are now adopted for home task planning, and children are also linked added to the users list. 
Trello is a planning tool that helps organising tasks so you can free yourself from remembering every detail in your project. The app has a template for parents and caregivers on how they can create tasks for their wards. 
In it, there is an ‘ideas’ list under which subjects for learning can be added. Alongside, activities for each day can be created. And at the end of each day parents and children can discuss how they went about with their tasks.
Asana works best along with Google suite. The app is similar to Trello and has over a million installs on Play Store with a 4.5 review average from over 29,000 users.
One of the best practices in making planning apps work for both parents and kids is to formulate tasks together. This way children feel that they own the task and take responsibility to complete it.
Russel Benaroya, a Seattle-based parent based said to MIT Technology Review: “Introducing software, whether it’s in a business setting or a personal setting, can feel jarring unless people are ready for that software to solve a problem that they’re all experiencing.” 
“We want the conversation to be about feeling autonomous and empowered to go about your time and getting things done.”",technology
This app scores you on your social distancing amid the Coronavirus pandemic,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/dror-app-adds-bluetooth-feature-which-scores-users-on-their-social-distancing/article31268723.ece,"Technology has been one of the frontlining industries in the battle against Coronavirus, but one of the tools which has been widely discussed is Bluetooth. On March 30, Delhi-based DROR released a Bluetooth-enabled ‘Social Distancing Tracker’ feature in its active eponymous app. 
DROR has been active since August 2018, and was conceptualised with women’s safety in mind. It connects healthcare facilities with citizens in the hour of need. “We promote women’s safety by leveraging technology and community insights, to enable everyone to build a trustworthy community,” says co-founder Dhiraj Nauhbar.
The ‘Social Distancing Tracker’ feature enables users to maintain their daily social distancing score by exchanging short-distance Bluetooth signals between phones to detect other users of the app who are in close proximity. 
Then the app processes this information based on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence-based algorithms, and informs the users of their social distancing score in real time, alerting the users if they get close to a high volume of human contact. This only works if the user’s Bluetooth is left on.
Dhiraj comments, “The only way to control this pandemic is through social distancing, as has been confirmed by health experts. Our effort is to make sure that we encourage people by showing them their daily, weekly and last 14 days social distancing score. Our tech team has worked very hard to create this solution and we will constantly endeavour to improve our attributes. We are ready to work with Centre and State governments to save our nation from Coronavirus.” He adds that the AI exempts those living with many roommates and in joint families.
Ask Dhiraj about the potential ‘Big Brother surveillance’ aspects of this app and he responds, “This app does not track your movements. It does, however, save your MAC address, and note down how many different devices you are in proximity with. We are also not sharing this data with any third party, but if the Government approaches us for such, that is a decision we will share with the app’s users.” But do we need to incentivise people to socially distance? “Unfortunately, the country thrives on a rewards-based system,” he says.
For now, DROR is only Android compatible and Dhiraj says Apple’s App Store has a different set of regulations. “It will be coming to iOS soon, though,” he says.",technology

Science Vs
This is probably among the most fun Science podcasts out there. Hosted by the cheery Australian science journalist Wendy Zukerman, each episode examines a widely held idea. The episode begins with the introduction of popular information (or, on most occasions, misinformation), and Zukerman, through research and interviews with experts in the field, reveals the truths and lies about it. The topics include construction of the pyramids, differences between men’s and women’s brain functions, and the one that is more relevant now: Coronavirus. What makes this one stand out from many science podcasts is its accessibility. It might not be meditative like the BBC Earth podcast, but Zukerman’s easy vocabulary and humorous narration makes Science Vs entertaining as well as informative.

How Kuchipudi exponent Deepika Reddy is appealing for empathy towards doctors fighting Coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hyderabad-kuchipudi-dancer-deepika-reddy-and-shloka-reddy-appeal-for-empathy-towards-doctors-fighting-coronavirus/article31267981.ece,"While most of us are happy just forwarding WhatsApp messages, reminding our family and friends to stay safe, members of the classical dance fraternity have been putting their best efforts to convey the message through their art. Hyderabad-based well-known Kuchipudi exponent Deepika Reddy and her daughter Shloka Reddy, released a video on YouTube paying tribute to the healthcare personnel fighting COVID-19 and appealing to people to trust their doctors and follow their advice.
Dressed alike in white, and dancing in the natural backdrop of their living room, the mother-daughter duo, through an impressive abhinaya, conveyed the message, ‘Meea arogyame, maa bhagyamule... Trust us that we consider your health as our wealth’. The Coronovirus rule , “Don’t shake hands, greet with namaste”, was portrayed beautifully too.
 




 
Explaining why their piece was ridden with empathy for doctors, Deepika says, “I was watching the news and came across the insensitive behaviour and unpardonable attacks on doctors and healthcare workers in Delhi and Hyderabad. Then I got this idea and brainstormed with my family and developed it.”
The lyrics were written by Vedantam Ramalinga Sastry six years ago as part of Deepika’s production ‘Vaidyo Narayano Harihi’. She edited and incorporated the lyrics that are relevant to the present pandemic. “The music and vocals were by DSV Sastry and were recorded six years ago with a full orchestra. Because of the lockdown there was no way for us to do the recording now and I was fortunate that I had my own recorded music that I could re-choreograph to suit COVID-19,” adds Deepika.
Deepika’s daughter Shloka was more than willing to team up with her mother and was also a part of the choreography process, and they finished rehearsing in three days, before recording.
Deepika who runs her Kuchipudi school Deepanjali, and is now busy with household chores and is spending quality time with the family. “My son returned from the U.S. and his quarantine period got over. As a precautionary measure we kept him in self quarantine in his room for 14 days. We have to be responsible and stay at home during this unprecedented worldwide pandemic and follow government guidelines. I’d like to add, don’t panic.

Farmers bring watermelons directly to Chennai homes during lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/society/farmers-bring-watermelons-directly-to-chennai-homes-during-lockdown/article31271107.ece,"“The farmland in and around Cheyyur taluk, under Chengalpet district, has about 10,000 pieces of fruit, about 390 tonnes, all piled up with no takers due to the lockdown” says farmer Alladi Mahadevan, “All our farmers are incurring heavy losses.” Mahadevan, who has a 36-acre organic farm at Kalpakkam, near Chennai, is trying to help these farmers find customers by using social media.
 “I am reaching out to huge apartment complexes in and around East Coast Road and Old Mahabalipuram Road, and using my transport take these watermelons to the residents, with police permission,” he says. So far, the response has been an enthusiastic one. “Such a support system is the need of the hour, or else these highly perishable commodities will go waste,” he adds.
Mahadevan explains how many farmers cultivate one or two acres of land around his farm, and how villagers in Pattambedu, Pavunjur, Koovathur and Malaarajakuppam and other regions which come under the taluk are the worst hit due the lockdown. These farmers usually get bulk orders from restaurant and fruit juice stall owners, as well as wholesale vegetable markets, “but with this sudden crash of logistics, they are left with no option but to sell to big players, who are using the situation to procure produce at a very low price,” says Mahadevan, adding that the farmers are being offered ₹2 to ₹3 per kilogram, for watermelons that are later sold at ₹18 per kilogram.
 “Be it a large scale or small scale farmer, the cost involved in cultivating watermelon is ₹35,000 to ₹40,000 per acre,” says KR Jayaprakash Reddy, an agriculturist based at Kolathur Malacherry village. He adds, “We can harvest approximately 15 tonnes of watermelons per acre, and I have already harvested 16 acres. I still have another 20 acres ready to be harvested in about 10 days.” He adds that he normally sells his entire harvest to wholesalers from Kerala and Karnataka, who bring their trucks to collect the harvest. “Local buyers are ruthlessly quoting a price of ₹2,000 per tonne, while the usual price is ₹10,000. But as I did not want my produce to perish, I sold it for the price they asked,” Prakash says.
“If it was guava or mango, we could have pulped it and stored it, but watermelon is not a pulpy fruit and has a life of just 10 days,” states Prakash. “This is a lesson we farmers have learnt. Usually it is groundnuts that we should be harvesting around this time, but as it is labour intensive, we shifted to watermelon, which is a 60 to 70-day cash crop. But with groundnuts, I would not have incurred such a huge loss, as I can sun dry and preserve them for many months, then sell when I get the right price.”
Right to your doorstepAlladi Mahadevan says that he sought support from citizens through social media on March 31, and so far had shipped eight tonnes, in seven truckloads to apartment complexes on OMR and in Thiruvanmiyur.“But there still are 350 tonnes more and I seek support to ensure farmers do not suffer heavily, as this is their livelihood, if they don’t sell it within the next one week.”Watermelons are being door delivered to communities in South Chennai. A group can come together and place an order (one fruit of approximately 5 kilograms costs ₹125) for a minimum of 20 fruits, and it will be delivered to your apartment gate, or wherever your apartment rules demand.Only online payment is accepted.

This Chennai couple delivers vegetables in an autorickshaw to those in need,https://www.thehindu.com/society/this-chennai-couple-delivers-vegetables-in-an-autorickshaw-to-those-in-need/article31271035.ece,"A year ago V Deepa decided to set up a small vegetable shop in Vijaya Nagar, Velachery, to supplement the income of her husband S Vignesh, an auto driver.
As she had financial commitments, she would leave her one-year-old baby with her mother-in-law and spend the day at the market. “I was gradually expanding my customer base and this lockdown has left me in the lurch,” she says, adding, “My husband also can’t earn anything as he cannot take his autorickshaw out. We were worried about how we will manage. That is when my husband suggested that we use his autorickshaw to sell vegetables,” says Deepa.
So on April 3, Deepa began to sell vegetables door-to-door in the vehicle in and around Velachery. 
“The idea seemed workable and I thought it would be a service to the public during the lockdown. I travel in the driver’s seat, along with my husband, as the rest of the space in our auto is filled with trays of vegetables,” says Deepa, adding that she resorted to a retro-method to attract customers. “I shout out, ‘avarakka, thakkali, parangikai, keera… ellam fresh kai amma’ at the top of my voice, as we drive past apartments and houses.” 
Deepa goes to Koyambedu by 5 am with her husband and spends two hours to procure vegetables for ₹2,000. She begins her door-to-door sales from 10 am onwards. “We wind up by 12.30 pm, and return home. The cost of vegetables has skyrocketed, therefore I get five kilos of six or seven varieties of vegetables. Demand seems high for fresh green vegetables such as broad beans, cluster beans, Ooty beans, lemon, ginger, drumstick, spinach and onions. Right now she does not sell fruits as the price is rather high. “If I get a kilo of tomato for ₹20, I sell it at ₹25, I don’t increase my margin more than ₹5 per kilo. After all the hard work, at the end of the day, we make ₹300 each.”
She currently stays with her mother in Perungudi as she can leave her baby in her care; her in-laws have left to their native town. “It is the elderly who are extremely happy that I bring vegetables to their doorstep. I wear gloves and cover my face with a mask, and leave the vegetables they want near their home, and request them to leave the cash in the basket, which I take after they leave,” she says. So far she has sold out all her vegetables within two or three hours and whatever is left — bruised vegetables — she feeds to the cows on the road. 
“We disinfect the auto as we are aware of the COVID-19 and the crisis the world is facing,” she adds. “If anyone requires we can go to other nearby locations as well to sell.” As Deepa is “not tech savvy”, she only deals in cash now.
“All these days, my husband would leave home by morning and return by midnight. Now this lockdown has given us an opportunity to spend 24/7 together. Romba jolliya irukku avar kooda eppovum irukkaradhu. If this works out well, then we might probably take it up on a permanent basis,” says Deepa.",society
COVID-19: Vienna hotel uses horse-drawn carriages to deliver food to elderly,https://www.thehindu.com/society/covid-19-vienna-hotel-uses-horse-drawn-carriages-to-deliver-food-to-elderly/article31269066.ece,"A luxury hotel in Vienna has started delivering food using horse-drawn carriages to the city’s older residents, who are confined in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The initiative by the luxury Intercontinental in the Austrian capital, was launched last week after the hotel was forced to close amid the shutdown measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease, Efe news reported.
“The hotel, unfortunately, is empty,” Brigitte Trattner, who runs the hotel, told Efe news on the phone on Friday. “We want to help. So we thought we could distribute food.”
Customers, over 70, place their orders the day before, and the food, typically traditional Austrian fare, is prepared every day in the kitchen by the hotel staff. On the first day of the initiative, they received about 170 orders. 
On Friday, that number had jumped to 250, and the kitchen, which is equipped to handle 350 orders per day, expects even more next week.
The service is only offered in one district of Vienna and runs thanks to unpaid volunteers who bring the food to the elderly, all wearing rubber gloves and face masks under strict sanitary conditions.
“A lot of young people have offered to help. People on their bikes or in their cars,” Trattner says.
But the real star of the delivery service are the three fiaker, traditional horse-drawn carriages typically seen showing tourists around the city’s sights, that have also joined the initiative.
The service will be running until at least April 13, when the current restrictions to slow the pandemic’s spread are due to expire, although they could well be extended beyond that.
After that, the hotel will continue distributing food to health workers at a nearby hospital.",society
"Firms expect decline in sales, profit: CII survey ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/firms-expect-decline-in-sales-profit-cii-survey/article31274238.ece,"A CII survey, in which nearly 200 CEOs participated, says that a majority of the firms expect revenues to fall more than 10% and profits by over 5% in the January-March 2020 and April-June 2020 quarters.
A decline in demand and impact on jobs will be some of the other after-effects for the industry in the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent countrywide lockdown, a release from the CII on the CEOs Snap Poll said. 
Stating that the pandemic was bound to deeply impact the economy, the CII said that the expectations of a sharp decline in both revenue and profit growth by the domestic firms could foretell the significant impact of the virus on GDP growth. 
The CII said that 80% of the firms claimed that their inventory was lying idle at present. However, more than 40% of the firms expected their stocks to last beyond a month once the lockdown ends, indicating their expectations of a demand slowdown in the post lockdown period.
A majority of the firms engaged in production of essential products and supply of ancillary goods are facing constrained operations in production and supply of essential goods and services during the ongoing lockdown.
According to the release, for the firms, access to manpower and movement of products had emerged as a major constraint in essentials trade, be it manufacturing or warehousing and transport or retail sales of essential commodities.
“While the Central Government has allowed manufacture, transportation and distribution of essentials, the enforcement at the local level has implemented the lockdown on essential commodities as well as services,” the release said.
About 52% of the firms anticipate job losses in their respective sectors following the COVID-19 outbreak and the consequent lockdown. 
The release said the proportion of jobs that are expected to be cut are quite staggered – 47% of the firms expect a less than 15% job loss, while 32% firms expect to shed about 15-30% of jobs once the lockdown ends.
CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee underscored the need for the government to come up with a fiscal stimulus package for the industry and implement it on a fast-track mode.",business
Virus may force firms to alter work style,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-may-force-firms-to-alter-work-style/article31274211.ece,"With COVID-19 bringing normal life to a standstill, several sectors, particularly those dealing with people, are likely to be hit hard, while other segments may have to rejig their work strategy.
Some of the businesses that are likely to bear the brunt are from the travel and tourism sector — namely airlines, hospitality and travel agencies. Other segments such as education, malls, theatres and restaurants will also be impacted.
“The wedding eco-system could take a hit like travel and tourism. Education could partially move online. Work places may have flexi-hours to reduce the crowding on the transportation system,” said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent analyst.
Religious and cultural events could take a backseat with limitations on head-count due to social distancing, he added.
“Mom-and-pop stores could be back in business with lesser footfalls in malls. The commercial space requirement may contract, whereas spaced out residential requirement could increase as decluttering gains pace,” Mr. Baliga said.
He said in future people may have to pass through disinfectant chambers and follow hygiene more vigorously. 
“The face mask would become a part of our attire. People will avoid places that are generally crowded and may prefer to watch movies at home than going to a theatre. While restaurants may take time to witness footfalls, home deliveries could see a spike. Our buying habits will shift online much faster than we have seen in the past,” Mr. Baliga said.
The ongoing travel restrictions which are expected to continue have severely impacted airlines and the hospitality business.
“The trajectory of the resumption of operations will be driven by the demand for travel, which would have clearly been damaged by the severe human and economic costs that COVID-19 is inflicting,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO and director, CAPA Advisory.
“Given the tremendous uncertainty around the duration of restrictions, projecting how long it will take the economy to normalise is fraught with risks. However, based on our understanding of the aviation system in India, our assessment is that the Indian aviation sector is likely to shrink significantly, even if some of the vulnerable airlines manage to survive,” he said.
Stating that from a point of complete suspension of travel, recovery would be slow, he said, “Demand will be suppressed due to economic dislocation; slow or even negative GDP growth; broken supply chains; low consumer confidence; and concerns about lingering outbreaks of COVID-19.”
The combination of COVID-related travel restrictions and an economic downturn is likely to result in 1QFY2021 being a virtual washout for the Indian industry, he said adding airline will be saddled with over 200 surplus aircraft.
As per CAPA estimates, domestic traffic is expected to decline from an estimated 140 million in FY2020 to around 80-90 million in FY2021. International traffic is expected to fall from approximately 70 million in FY2020 to 35-40 million in FY2021, and possibly less. 
The co-working segment is also seeing changes.
“Even though there has been a slowdown in the market, it is still early to assess the impact on the co-working industry. Decision making is slow, and deal closures will take longer than usual, but we believe this is a temporary situation,” said Neetish Sarda, founder, Smartworks, a co-working company.
“Due to the increased pressure, the co-working industry might see some consolidation soon. Companies are readjusting their operations to ensure business continuity. For us, the enquiries for completely managed office spaces have increased in the past few weeks,” he said.
“Going forward, companies will stay cautious and ramp up regular workplace hygiene and sanitisation practices. We see ourselves closely working with our clients and monitoring and tracking necessary details like their employee travel history, early follow-up, or scanning of any warning signs related to health hazards. We will continue with our measures for our workspaces infection-free,” he added.
Ravi Saxena, managing director, Wonderchef, said malls may suffer due to long waiting time for entry. Multiplexes and food courts are crowded places where social distancing is simply not possible. 
“This means the business would spill over to digital platforms and also neighbourhood kirana stores. E-commerce is the oil that can keep the economy lubricated in this challenging time. Home deliveries are actually the safest form of consumption. They will prevent community spread drastically,” he said.
Murali Ramachandran, CEO-India, Celebi Aviation Holding Inc., said the aviation industry, being at the centre of the coronavirus pandemic, is probably the most impacted. 
“The situation has become quite concerning now. There has been a steep fall in the number of flights being handled. It is almost negligible now. With a work force of over 8,000, we might have to take up some extreme decisions like ‘leave without pay’ and other measures as an alternative to try and secure our market viability,” he said.",business
2-wheeler sales may drop up to 13%,https://www.thehindu.com/business/2-wheeler-sales-may-drop-up-to-13/article31274159.ece,"The two-wheeler industry is likely to witness another year of demand contraction with sales expected to decline by 11-13% to around 18 million units in FY2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic growth and discretionary spending, rating agency ICRA said.
Even prior to the outbreak, the demand for two-wheelers was expected to be flat in India amid a sharp rise in vehicle prices following the transition to BS-VI emission norms, resulting in 10-12% inflation and a subdued macroeconomic scenario, the agency noted.
“The challenges for the industry are likely to get aggravated as consumer spending will be severely impacted by the outbreak, resulting in lower spending power both in urban and rural markets. There is a likelihood of downtrading by consumers as well once the economy starts to crawl back to normalcy,” it added.
Shamsher Dewan, vice-president, ICRA said, “We expect two-wheeler OEMs to brace for another year of lower earnings and decline in operating margins, to 11.5-12% from around 14% in the previous year.”
Mr. Dewan added that besides lower sales, pressure on earnings will also arise due to costs involved in recalling BS-IV inventory from dealers, which is likely to remain unsold due to shutdowns. Additionally, during periods of stress, OEMs would also have to extend credit support to its dealers, thus leading to a potential increase in working capital intensity.
ICRA added that given the rapid spread of the pandemic in India and overseas, and the possibility of further extension of lockdowns, revival from the down-cycle is expected to be delayed by at least a few quarters.",business
Up to 40% of planes may stay on ground for 12 months: CAPA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/up-to-40-of-planes-may-stay-on-ground-for-12-months-capa/article31274152.ece,"Nearly 40% of the combined fleet of Indian airlines may not take to the skies in the next 12 months as the demand for air travel is likely to remain subdued, according to aviation consultancy firm CAPA.
In its latest report on the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian aviation sector, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) has forecast that the demand for domestic air travel will decline 60% to about 80-90 million trips, and for international travel it may drop 50% to approximately 35-40 million in the current fiscal as compared with the last financial year. 
Of the total fleet size of 650 aircraft, as many as 200-250 planes are likely to remain surplus for the next 6-12 months, CAPA noted.
“Demand will be suppressed due to economic dislocation; slow or even negative GDP growth; broken supply chains; low consumer confidence; and concerns about lingering outbreaks of COVID-19, especially if travel insurance companies refuse to provide cover for associated medical expenses or travel disruption costs.”
With domestic and international flights suspended by the Indian government until April 14 and flight operations likely to resume only in a staggered manner, CAPA said that the first quarter of the current fiscal was likely to be a washout, and airlines could be expected to “limp back to recovery” in the second quarter, which is traditionally a week season for travel demand.
 “For India, to return to a pre-COVID operational fleet of 650 aircraft is likely to take up to 12 months from the time that restrictions are lifted, and this may be conservative. 
“A gradual path to recovery is expected in quarter three and four.”
The slump in demand may force some airlines to return their aircraft to lessors to save on rental costs.

The country’s demand for such gear far outpaced the supply with the outbreak of COVID-19. To improve the supply of these essential accessories in the country, 3M India has increased the production of these at its manufacturing facility in Ranjangaon, off Pune.
Ramesh Ramadurai, MD, 3M India, said: “We have increased the production of respirators, surgical masks and hand sanitisers in the range of 35% to 40%. Now, we are almost exclusively directing our supplies to a large number of government and private healthcare providers, front-line healthcare workers and nodal agencies in India.”
“The demand has outpaced supply by several times and we are doing our best to make sure that our manufacturing plant is running 24x7 in these critical times. Respirators are close to our heart at this moment of great need. 
“The local authorities have supported us by giving us required exemptions for the operation,” he said.
Respirators are the most important protective gear against COVID-19. 3M India makes two different types of respirators, P1 and P2, while it imports N95 masks. 
Local authorities have also made a wide variety of 3M products, such as kitchen, home and bathroom chemicals, cleaning tools, materials, scrubs, pads, brushes, swipes and gloves, as part of essentials, as the company is globally known for its focus on healthcare and home care.
The Minnesota-based 3M Company said last week it would boost the U.S. production of its N95 filter respirator masks to 50 million per month by June.

 Pharmexcil wants RBI to ease non-fund limits,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pharmexcil-wants-rbi-to-ease-non-fund-limits/article31274043.ece,"Pharmaceutical raw materials and finished goods worth more than $1 billion are stuck at ports on account of transportation and manpower constraints, Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil) has said. 
Consequently, the COVID-19-led disruption has led to pharmaceutical units unable to operate beyond 25-30% of their normal operational manufacturing capacity. The situation comes despite the pharmaceutical industry classified as commodities and services.
Pharmexcil chairman Dinesh Dua cited this in an appeal to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for relaxation in certain terms of non-fund based limit. 
“Our member-companies request you to immediately consider at least an extension of six months for due payments against non-fund limits predominantly provided through Letter of Credit for making the payments to the bankers,” he said in a letter to the RBI Governor copies of which were marked to the Prime Minister, a few Union Ministers and senior officials concerned. Pharmexcil has about 3,500 member-companies who generate value turnover of $50 billion — $25 billion each for domestic and exports. 
March witnessed very serious disruption both in terms of manufacturing as well as supply chain, resulting in a financial setback for the entire industry, leading to inability of practically all pharmaceutical firms to continue to produce and make available highly cost-effective and quality pharmaceutical products both in India as well as overseas, he said, stressing that such a stimulus from the RBI is “very urgently needed on account of [the] huge disruption” created the world over on account of COVID-19.
“We are flooded with calls asking for financial relief, particularly in terms of non-fund limits, as 10% of the turnover as additional COVID working capital limit, as sanctioned as a part of RBI stimulus package, is grossly insufficient on account of this mega disruption,” he said.

IPO fund-raising up 60% in FY20,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ipo-fund-raising-up-60-in-fy20/article31274012.ece,"Fund raising via public equity markets rose by more than 60% in 2019-20 even as the fiscal ended on a highly volatile note with a drop of almost 30% in the Sensex.
In 2019-20, a total of ₹91,670 crore was raised, which was 62% higher than the previous fiscal’s ₹56,485 crore, as per data from Prime Database. 
The mobilisation, however, was 48% lower than the all-time high of ₹1.76 lakh crore raised in 2017-18. 
The fiscal 2019-20 saw 13 main board public issues raising a cumulative amount of ₹20,350 crore, an increase of 38% from the ₹14,719 crore raised through 14 initial public offers (IPOs) in 2018-19.
Further, the largest IPO in 2019-20 was that of SBI Cards & Payment Services, which was worth ₹10,341 crore, though the average deal size was ₹1,565 crore.
Interestingly, the overall response to main board IPOs was decent as eight of the IPOs were subscribed more than 10 times each with IRCTC topping the list by getting subscribed 109 times.
The subscription was also a factor of overall market buoyancy as only the last quarter of the fiscal saw a sudden downturn due to concerns related to global slowdown and COVID-19.
The buoyancy was also reflected in the share price returns as shares of seven of the 13 IPOs gained more than 10% on the listing day. 
Moreover, despite the ongoing pandemic and its subsequent impact on the markets, seven of the 13 IPOs are currently still trading above the issue price.
The year also saw about 50 companies, with a cumulative offer size worth ₹34,663 crore, allowing the regulatory approval to lapse. All IPOs need to get a nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), that is valid for one year.
Meanwhile, for the first time since the dedicated platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) was launched in 2012, the activity in the segment declined with only 45 SME IPOs, with total fund-raising of ₹436 crore, hitting the market. It was significantly lower than the FY19’s ₹1,620 crore.

Most MSMEs skip March salary: AIMO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/most-msmes-skip-march-salary-aimo/article31273979.ece,"About 71% of the MSME establishments were unable to pay either partially or fully the wages due for March 2020 either due to logistics issue or absence of orders, among other issues, according to All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO).
AIMO, which is an apex trade body focused on the interests of the MSME sector, surveyed over 5,000 traders/MSMEs across the country over the last few days regarding the status and payment of wages/salaries for the month of March.
K.E. Raghunathan, past president, AIMO, said that salaries could not be paid for reasons such as computation, logistics and distribution issues for cash payments and cash flow.
Besides, more than 52% of the entrepreneurs found it difficult to assess and determine how much to pay as some of their staff had worked from home while some of them had remained idle at home.
Almost 63% of the entrepreneurs cited cash-flow issues for their inability to make wage payments, as the receipts from their customers had almost dropped to zero and there was no advance received during March for fresh orders. The cycle of ‘circulation or rotation of money’ had come to a zero.
Over 47% of the establishments also found it difficult to determine how to pay salaries to employees who may not have a bank account or access to bank account or had gone back to their villages, despite working for about 20 days in March.
However, certain sectors, which provided necessities such as basic food and toiletries, saw a rise in their net growth over the last 15 days due to panic-buying and increasing demand, the survey said. Ancillary manufacturing, automobile spare parts, apparel, consumer durables, electronics, tourism, restaurants, seafood and livestock, construction and real estate, travel and transportation are the worst-hit by COVID-19.",business

"COVID-19 lockdown: Better to renegotiate business contracts, say legal experts ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-lockdown-better-to-renegotiate-business-contracts-say-legal-experts/article31268994.ece,"
The 21-day lockdown amid the COVID-19 outbreak, has impacted businesses across sectors, and some have started to invoke the ‘Force Majeure’ clause in the contracts to protect themselves against performance obligations. However, according to experts, the best way to deal with the situation is to re-negotiate the contracts, rather than terminate them.
The term ‘Force Majeure’ is a French term, which means ‘superior force.’ It refers to an event or effect that can be neither anticipated nor controlled. The term includes both acts of nature and acts of people, including but not limited to natural disasters, riots etc. In such conditions, the force majeure clause in the contract/agreement, if present, will define the scope of applicability of this principle, Anant Merathia, a Chennai-based corporate lawyer said.
“It is the language of the clause in the contract that enumerates the application of the principle and also defines its scope. Businesses are reviewing their contracts, to determine the exact applicability on a case-to case basis,” he pointed out.
The real estate sector would be highly impacted starting from builder vs. contractor and builder vs. homebuyer obligations; leasehold relationships of lessors/landlords and tenants (especially in retail space), bulk volume trade contracts -- domestic and international -- are some key sectors where this has come into effect, amongst several others.
“There is a normal duty of the parties to mitigate the effects of the force majeure event and there must be substantial reason to prove that the said event is the cause of non-performance/impossibility of the contract. Impossibility does not mean physical or literal impossibility but that the event may have totally upset the very foundation of the contract/agreement,” Mr. Merathia said.
“There is always an alternative to renegotiate or to temporarily suspend the contract/agreement, extend its performance period and resolve amicably. Taking adverse actions leading to disputes/litigation thereby affecting business image and relationships is definitely not advisable in the present scenario,” he said.
K. Vaitheeswaran, advocate and tax consultant said even if the contract does not have a force majeure clause, Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 stipulates that an agreement to do an impossible act is void. “Irrespective of whether a force majeure clause is present, the doctrine of frustration of contract will apply to cases where the performance becomes impossible owing to some act beyond the control of the parties to the contract,” he said.
For parties without a force majeure clause in the contract, it is best advised to renegotiate and include a clause for the same. The time for performance of the contract can also be re-negotiated and extended accordingly, to avoid unnecessary litigation, Mr. Vaitheeswaran said.",business

A virtual platform for début directors ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-virtual-platform-for-dbut-directors/article31270377.ece,"Lohith H made his début with Mummy (2016) featuring Priyanka Upendra in the lead. The horror film, written and directed by him, went on to be a hit and also won the Karnataka State Award in the best editing category. His second film, Devaki, again a thriller with Priyanka and her daughter Aishwarya Upendra, won both audience and critical acclaim.
The film was also released in Telugu as Chinnari produced under KRK Productions and Lakshmi Venkateswara Movies. Ajaneesh Loknath composed the music and lyrics were by Yogaraj Bhat.
When he looks back, Lohith recalls that finding a producer for Mummy was a herculean task. “Just finding a producer took me about a year and a half. I must have met at least 50 to 60 producers,” reveals the 26-year-old. “That is why Kishor Narasimha and I created an online platform called Friday Films, to showcase films by début directors.”







The aim, explains Lohith, is to help passionate filmmakers find a footing in the industry. Friday Films Production House was started two months ago and the team launched an online filmmaking contest on April 3.
“We are looking for five-minute horror films in any language,” says Lohith. Friday Films, will soon produce its first film, a remake of a Malayala film Helen. “The film will take off as soon as the lockdown is lifted. It will be directed by a début director, who has already been chosen.” Lohith adds that he has been approached by a huge production house for a film, which will be launched officially soon.
The online contest, Lohith says, is because of the lock-down, aspiring directors have been texting for job opportunities. “As I have trod the same path, I know it will be tough to take a complete newcomer to work with a trained unit. I feel, when they send their films, it will be clear as to what they think and how they portray characters on screen. Even when I met Priyanka and Upendra for Mummy, they both loved the story, but I was 24 years old and they were apprehensive how I would tell the story on screen. When they saw my teaser shots, they were convinced and gave me the go ahead.”







When most filmmakers choose comedy or a romance to mark their débuts, Lohith chose horror. Was he worried how the film would turn out and how the audience would react? “Horror is not my genre at all. I came into the industry at the age of 19 and wanted to make a gangster film. No one took me seriously, perhaps because of my age and also because I had no backing. Then I decided to make a heroine-centric film, in the horror genre and zeroed in on Priyanka.”
Check points
The film has to be in the horror genre.
Should be shot within your home on any camera or mobile with original music.
Last date to send in your entry is April 15.

COVID-19 pandemic pulls India’s service sector activity into contraction mode ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/covid-19-pandemic-pulls-indias-service-sector-activity-into-contraction-mode/article31267554.ece," India’s services sector activity contracted during March as the COVID-19 pandemic dented demand, particularly in overseas markets, while public health measures aimed at stemming the outbreak curtailed discretionary spending, a monthly survey said on Monday.
 The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index was at 49.3 in March, down from February’s 85-month high of 57.5, as the new coronavirus pandemic pulled the service sector into contraction.
 The headline figure fell by over 8 points, undoing the strong gains in growth momentum seen throughout 2019, the survey said.
 In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

 “The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on India’s services economy has not been fully realised yet,” Joe Hayes, Economist at IHS Markit, said, adding that “the survey data collection (March 12-27) was concluding just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a complete lockdown of the country“.
 Hayes further said that “clearly the worse is yet to come as nationwide store closures and prohibition to leave the house will weigh heavily on the services economy, as has been seen elsewhere in the world.”
 According to panel members, business activity was reduced in response to weaker demand and firms responded by reducing their workforces as intakes of new business were insufficient to maintain payroll numbers.
 Latest survey data pointed to the first fall in order book volumes at Indian service providers since September 2019.
 “Pressure now fully lies on the government to combat the economic challenges the lockdown will cause,” Hayes said.

Michael Phelps urges athletes to find positives in the delay,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/michael-phelps-urges-athletes-to-find-positives-in-the-delay/article31282927.ece,"US Olympic great Michael Phelps says it’s “hard to comprehend” what today’s athletes are going through with the Tokyo Games postponed in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
“It’s our life,” Phelps said in a TV interview on Monday. 
“I’ve tried to replay what I would be going through emotionally at this very time if I was still competing. It’s hard to really kind of comprehend it.”
The International Olympic Committee took the decision to postpone the Games as Olympic hopefuls found it harder and harder to train with sports and facilities shut down by the pandemic.
Phelps, who retired after the 2016 Rio Olympics with a record 28 medals — 23 of them gold — said athletes must try to find positives in the delay.
“You go through something for four years. We kind of know exactly when it’s going to come, and our bodies are ready for it, and then we have to wait,” he said. 
“The biggest thing now is everybody to look at this as an opportunity, an opportunity for another year, fine-tuning some small things that are going to help you make a big difference.”
Phelps, who has detailed his own battles with anxiety and depression, had already voiced concern that the stress of postponement could take a toll on the mental health of athletes.
“If you are in a spot where you need help, to reach out and ask for help,” Phelps said of the advice he is offering. “It was something that was very difficult for me to do.”",other sports

Hailing from the nondescript Daburpur village of Sonipat district in Haryana, Sunil overcame his negative approach and focused on pre-match preparation to bring home an Asian championship medal after 27 years in Delhi last month.
The postponement of the Asian Olympic qualifier this month may not have been a welcome development for an in-form Sunil, but the 21-year-old is not disheartened. 
“My confidence is high after becoming the Asian champion. It is true that it would have been good (had the Olympic qualifier happened as per schedule). But every wrestler was trying to do his best and the situation is the same for everybody,” Sunil told The Hindu. “The positive side is that the delay gives me extra time to work on my game and iron out weaknesses.”
Despite being restricted to his home, Sunil, backed by Lakshya Sports, has become mentally stronger to make the most of the present situation. 
“Without any sparring partner, I am training on my own — doing running, dumbbell, rope exercises and other equipment available at home. I am sticking to my schedule of training twice a day.”
Mental conditioning and peak-performance coach Dr. Swaroop Savanur, who turned Sunil around, said, “Right now, I am telling him to ‘de-focus’ from his game completely. I am also working with him on certain visualisation techniques and short-term goals.”
Sunil — who had a poor outing in the World Championships in Nur-Sultan last year — raised his game, especially his ground wrestling, to shine in the Asian championships. He wants to improve further to achieve bigger targets.

First appearance of Deepfake AI face-swapping in Chinese web series
Chinese actor Liu Lu was recently involved in a clash with China’s public transport authorities over the allowable limit of flammable compressed gas cans.
That clash led to her name going up on the ‘bad artists list’ in China. The actor’s contract with Mango TV for a web TV series was terminated following this incident. 
But the filming of the series was over before the actor’s dispute with Chinese authorities. 
So, the producer swapped the Ms. Lu’s face with that of another actor in a Chinese web series “Love of Thousand Years,” ChinAI reported.
This is the first reported incident of face-swapping in a Chinese TV show.
The deepfake video has been widely ridiculed by viewers for its poor quality.
While the actor played only a small part in the series, the quality of the faceswap was poor as the image was distorted and expressions were mapped poorly.
Last year, China woke up to the problem of deepfakes when a Chinese actor’s image was swapped with another’s in an old movie. 
But that was a very short video, unlike the one attempted by the TV series producer.

WhatsApp sets new limit on forwarded messages to fight misinformation
Facebook-owned private messaging app WhatsApp has set a new limit on a type of forward to reduce the spread of misinformation.
Messages marked with double arrows can now be passed on to only one chat at a time, down from five. 
The company introduced the idea of marking messages with double arrows last year to reduce ‘virality’.
That move has helped it bring down the number of forwards by 25% globally.
The recent move to limit forwards with double arrows shows that the platform is working on changing user behaviour to move back to private conversations, and reduce circulation of forwards that begin from unknown sources.
“We’ve seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation,” the company said in a statement.
“We believe it’s important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation.”
To ensure that people receive credible information, WhatsApp is working with governments and international agencies to provide accurate communication.
These trusted authorities have sent several million messages directly to people requesting information and advice, the company said.
WhatsApp also encourages its users to report any suspicious or inaccurate information to the International Fact-Checking Network to verify the message’s claim.

Facebook partners with Carnegie Mellon University to support COVID-19 research
Social media giant Facebook has been sharing population movement data with researchers and non-for-profits to understand the coronavirus crisis. It uses aggregate data to protect user’s privacy. 
Now, the company is launching new tools, in partnership with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, to help inform disease forecasting efforts and protective measures.
Starting from Monday, some users in the US will see a link at the top of their News Feed. The link leads to a survey to help health researchers monitor and forecast COVID-19 spread.
The survey is run by Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Center, and the data picked up from it will be used to generate new insights on how to respond to the crisis. It will also include heat maps of self-reported symptoms.
The idea behind this survey is to help health systems plan where resources are needed, and identify parts of the region that can be reopened.
“If the results are helpful, we’ll make similar surveys available in other parts of the world,” Facebook said in a statement.
CMU will not be sharing individual survey data with Facebook, and the social network will not share information on who the survey respondents are. This helps in protecting users’ privacy.
The data will also be aggregated to understand city- or state-level changes.
Facebook has created three tools that will do the job for health system professionals. It co-location maps will show the probability that people in one area will come in contact with people in another. This will show where the possible next COVID-19 case might be.
With movement range trends, it tracks data at the regional-level on whether people are staying near their homes or visiting many parts of the town.
Finally, the social connectedness index maps friendship across states and countries to help epidemiologists forecast the likelihood of disease spread.

WhatsApp said that its previous move to reduced limit on forwarded messages to constrain virality led to a 25% decrease in message forwards globally at the time. 
The company had in 2018 started testing the forwarding limit of five chats at once in India, where people forward more messages, photos, and videos than any other country in the world. The forward limit was later introduced around the world in 2019. 
The company had also started labeling messages that have been forwarded many times with double arrows to indicate they did not originate from a close contact. “In effect, these messages are less personal compared to typical messages sent on WhatsApp. We are now introducing a limit so that these messages can only be forwarded to one chat at a time,” it said.
In addition, the company said it is working directly with NGOs and governments, including the World Health Organization and over 20 national health ministries, to help connect people with accurate information.",technology
Netflix globally updates parental controls to ensure secure streaming experience for kids,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/netflix-globally-launches-update-to-parental-control-features-for-children-safety-in-streaming/article31283315.ece,"For a streaming service that boasted a diverse library, progressive technology and high-end productions, Netflix’s parental control features were lax at best, and many parent-members the world over were not happy. But if your kids have logged into Netflix after 10:30 pm on April 7 you may notice that the streaming giant has globally updated these features with tighter protocols. 
In a Google Meet interview with Netflix’s Michelle Parsons, Manager of Kids & Family Product Innovation, and Cameron Johnson, Director of TV Product Innovation, it is clear that there is some sense to the timing for the launch of such a feature amid the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns around the world, but not intentionally so.

So, for context, what did the platform have prior to the update? The typical Netflix gate (landing page) has the member profiles displayed, with the master profiles (the password holders) included. Netflix, as a default, has a customisable Children’s profile which curates content according to the back-end settings done in the ‘Profiles and Parental Controls’ section in Account Settings. Another existing feature is the title-specific filtration, in that one can prevent content from showing up in searches and on the landing pages by entering the titles’ names. 
What do we still need? Controlling screen time is one of the most worrisome aspects of child-rearing. But Netflix says this, as a potential feature, might not be in the books for them. Michelle explains, “When you try to modify timers at the app level, there are ways for kids to circumvent the timers. Using device-level timers is one option parents have. We want to provide parents the tools and information they need to customise the experience without undermining how long a piece of content might be.” The aforementioned title restriction feature could use some development though. At the moment, it only filters out title-specific content, so if a child does not like content related to cars or anime content, you cannot filter out according to keywords. Michelle assures that Netflix is working on this feature though social media will say this has been a long-time demand of members.
“This profile hub is the first update we are making which includes a one-stop shop for all the settings for each individual on the account,” says Michelle. “Parents will be able to modify viewing restrictions here on a per-profile basis. Given you will be making these modifications in a child’s profile, you can only go as far up to what is deemed appropriate for kids.” 
Once you set a profile’s permissions according to age group, content which does not fall within the allowed margins is filtered out. As a viewer, the child will not see any box art or trailers for the filtered-out content either. 
Michelle continues, “We have the ability for members to customise the viewing restrictions both at maturity rating and at an individual title level, now on a per-profile basis. So each profile on a single account can have slightly different settings and customisations based on the individual’s needs.”
Additionally, parent profiles — which mostly have no restrictions on content — have a lock with a four-digit PIN, unique to each profile. These PINs are also used for the profiles’ modifications. To create a new profile with all-access content, the master PIN is once again required. Parents can also control playback settings, i.e enabling or disabling auto-play within a series, which can be helpful in preventing binge-watching and screen-time overload.

“The new tools will offer a lot of flexibility to parents to create an experience that suits their families’ unique needs whether they have small kids or older kids in their households, or varying needs dependent on cultural context,” Michelle concludes. On a user interface level, she adds that there will be no major design change as the intention is to not disrupt the viewing experience.",entertainment
‘Persona 5 Royal’ review: Energetic comic book-styled graphics and edgy character design,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/gamespot-atlus-persona-5-royal-video-game-review-energetic-comic-book-styled-graphics-and-edgy-character-design/article31279230.ece,"While most Japanese RPGs (role-playing games) are long jaunts through mystical realms, featuring heroes with gravity-defying hairstyles, the Persona series is a class apart. Persona 5 Royal, or P5R, is a re-release of 2017’s Persona 5, a game you may have missed then, but fear not, this is another chance to give this reincarnation a whirl. 
Persona 5 RoyalDeveloper: P-StudioPublisher: AtlusPrice: ₹3499 for Playstation 4
Persona games are sort of high school simulators, balancing the rigour of exams, the raging hormones of young love and a lot of teenage angst. Top that off with a whole bunch of supernatural activity that seems to be snapping heads off and causing chaos in Tokyo, and you have all the makings of an excellent young adult adventure. You play a recently (and wrongfully) expelled student. Shamed and exiled to Tokyo, you take up residence with a surly coffee shop owner as your guardian and a new school life before you.
P5R plays across a year of school life, as you and your new friends navigate social and scholastic responsibilities. The kick? By night, you don the guise of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, aided by the masks you wear everyday, which manifest as creatures known as Persona. You make your way through people’s hearts to change the darkness within them, and with each accomplishment, you and your merry band of thieves grow both in the real world and the metaverse.

The game makes some much-needed changes to the battle system, adding more zest to the turn-based action. Look forward to gun ammo that replenishes before every battle, the dungeons made more fun with collectables, and a grappling hook that lets you reach hidden places. Yes, there is a lot more depth to the grind. In the real world, in addition to making lasting relationships with your companions, you also meet some colourful characters to hang out with. You will love Ann Takamaki. Note: the more bonds you make, the more powerful your Persona get.

While the original Persona 5 was exciting, it did stretch on way longer than most games should. If you played the original, there is not much here to get you interested in a full play-through. P5R adds on a lot more to it: such as new characters to join your team and a new school counsellor Takuto Maruki, both with worthy and meaningful storylines. To balance that off in your busy schedule, a lot of the activities are well integrated during the day, and some of the learning activities that took up an entire time slot, can now be done in quick bursts of fun puzzles. Persona 5 features real-world Tokyo landmarks where you can hang out with your friends, and Royal adds in the neon clad tiny alleys of Kichijoji into the mix.
If there ever was a game that embodied the word ‘style’, it is Persona 5 Royal. With energetic comic book-styled graphics and edgy character design, it is a treat going through the menus, because most of the game is controlled through menus, including the action. Writing, too, is excellent, as is the voice acting, driving a story that engages you in the day-to-day grit of these kids’ lives. Given escapism, of any sort, is the need of the hour, P5R will deliver.

A new boardgame is keeping people of Madurai engaged during the COVID-19 lockdown ,https://www.thehindu.com/society/a-new-boardgame-is-keeping-people-of-madurai-engaged-during-the-covid-19-lockdown/article31280270.ece,"Two years ago, when he devised Asude, his own boardgame, U Abdul Rahman didn’t think it would one day help people deal with depression. Now, during the Government-imposed lockdown, the 26-year-old is teaching the game to those who have been rescued from Madurai’s streets and housed at a wedding hall in Palanganatham. “There are 89 people here, some of whom are mentally-challenged and those who are homeless,” says Abdul.
The district administration reached out to Abdul to keep people there occupied. “A few of them are facing mental health issues since all of a sudden, they are being asked to stay indoors for weeks at a stretch,” he adds. Adbul taught them the game, and plays with them for two hours every day. “I ensure that we maintain social-distancing. We wear masks and do not play all at once.”
It’s been over a week since the rehabilitated people have been playing the boardgame and already, Abdul says that he is able to feel a difference in their overall mood. “They seem more cheerful now,” he adds. More importantly, they are being encouraged to spare a thought for our planet’s precious resources, thanks to the game’s format.







Abdul explains: “What if we were on the last day of this planet’s existence and animals and human beings had to look for water to save everyone’s lives? This is my game’s premise. Players will have to come up with solutions for our planet’s problems in the course of the game.”
Abdul is from Thideer Nagar in Madurai. “My mother E Razia Begum raised me with a lot of difficulty since my father was absent from our lives most of the time,” he says. Which is why once he graduated he decided to choose a career path that helped society. “I’m a storyteller and interact with children from villages around Madurai, teaching them small things that will go a long way in their lives,” he explains, adding that he does so through his company Brain Light — Mind Safety Games and Arts Centre.
He has also popularised Asude among Government school children in and around Madurai. “It has changed people’s lives,” he says. “Children have been inspired to plant trees after playing it, a boy told me he called his mother after years…” Abdul hopes that some of its positivity rubs off on those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Helping hands: Here’s how community kitchen and NGOs in Visakhapatnam are helping the homeless,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ngos-and-gurudwaras-in-visakhapatnam-step-up-to-help-the-vunerable-and-homeless/article31279026.ece,"Knives slice through vegetables, rice is washed and ladles clang against cauldrons at the Guruwara Sadh Sangat in Visakhapatnam. At the crack of dawn, every day, 12 in-house staff start cooking for 600 people. They work swiftly as the officials from Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) will arrive to pick up the food at 12.30 pm and carry it away to distribute to the shelter homes across the city.
“We always have langar at the gurdwara, but after the announcement of the lockdown we decided to use the stocked up groceries to feed the poor and homeless during these tough times. The GVMC reached out to us for food and since March 31 we have been sending out these food packages,” says Dr S D Anand, president of Gurdwara.
They cook vegetable biryani, pulav and bisibelebath along with raita every alternate day. “Even after the lockdown ends we plan to keep giving the food to these homeless people. We also intend to start serving the poor and homeless at the gurdwara,” Anand adds.
The management at the gurdwara also donated groceries to over 110 Shikligar families (traditionally blacksmiths belonging to the Sikh community). “They migrated to the city several decades ago and live mostly around Anakapalle, Madhurwada, Gajuwaka, Kommadi, Maddilapalem and Peda Gantyada. Most of these families are not well off and so we provided them with groceries for a month,’ he says.

Several other organisations and individuals in Visakhapatnam are reaching out to the hungry and the homeless. As the fears about the virus spread, masks and sanitizers flew off the racks. Even hospitals struggled to find them for their doctors and paramedical staff. Ananya Gopalshetty, an entrepreneur, decided to step in and help out the doctors in government-run hospitals.
Being well connected with several suppliers in the city, Ananya managed to collect 1000 masks and over 35 litres of sanitizers and donated them to King George Hospital and the Government TB and Chest Hospital. “There is also a Whatsapp group dedicated to the needs of people during the lockdown that informs others about what is happening in the city. It was through this group that I learnt about the lack of protective gear for the medical personnel. So through CII- Young Indians, an organisation that I am a part of we reached out to city-based company Think 3D to print face sheets. We have seen the samples they provided us and soon we will be getting these made in bulk to donate at the hospitals,” she says.
Think 3D is a printing service provider headquartered in Visakhapatnam. The company is working full steam to manufacture face shields, ventilator splitters, ventilator components, COVID-19 test kit machines and COVID-19 test kits.
“3D printing is way faster than the conventional methods of making face shields. In times like these where time is important, we are trying to scale up the production as much as possible. Apart from Young Indians several organisations from across the country have approached us for these commodities. Right now we are focusing on the printing of face shields and test kits as they are the need of the hour,” says Raja Sekhar Upputuri, co-founder of Think 3D.
Ananya who owns the Siripuram-based Waltair Kitchen makes food with the help of her in-house staff. “Currently, my husband and I are financing it but we have also started accepting donations. If more people came forward, we could do more,” she adds.
Greenface, an NGO that works for environmental issues is supporting other organisations by donating medicines, food and other necessities. “When we contacted NGOs that were reaching out to stranded people, we learnt that food supply was the main concern. Since my brother runs a hotel, we got in touch with his food suppliers and procured rice, pulses and edible oil. Anyone who requires medicines can also reach out to us with the prescription and we will try to get those,” says Ratna Latha, founder of Greenface.

Travails of a working (from home) woman,https://www.thehindu.com/society/travails-of-a-working-woman-during-corona/article31278355.ece,"I have lost four kg. No kidding. No, I did not work out for hours. Nor did I diet with obsession. I worked from home — and for home. Oh, I’m putting the cart before the horse. First the provocation for this rant. A well-meaning offspring, living abroad, texted: “Take care and enjoy the forced rest.” My lips curled in a wry smile and eyes opened in startled revelation. So the world thinks that the much beleaguered working woman of India is finally relaxing, feet up. Nothing can be farther from the truth. BTW, this is not for the liberated GenNext young women because they will not relate to the situation. For the others here we go...
This lockdown is stretching the limits of woman power. If someone thought that women are great because they balance home and career so beautifully, here is some gnan. They now have surpassed themselves by running office from home apart from running that said home, hands tied behind their backs, without missing a beat.
With none of the comforts or facilities the work place could offer (we sorely miss the kiosk, for starters) and just the basic tools that could possibly be provided in these circumstances, the women are taking care of production. The ‘punch in’ and ‘punch out’ option the HR so thoughtfully provided on our cell phones has been reduced to a farce. Because we seem to be on the job what seems like round-the-clock, juggling responsibilities on several fronts. The best time to do office work these days is night, when the lights are dimmed and the house is in slumber.
With domestic help staying away, the kitchen sink has to be constantly cleared. Naturally, no door delivery of food. This means that the larder has to be constantly replenished. With whatever available in a curfew situation. After all, so many mouths have to be fed and watered (euphemism, of course, for hot and cool beverages). Right from morning coffee to dinner and the nightcap of hot milk, planning is crucial even as official work has to continue seamlessly. Emails have to be sent, documents read, edited, pages curated. Coordination with colleagues proceeds and decisions are made amidst an over-strained system and a groaning wifi connection. The need for an additional pair of hands is felt more now than ever.
A household with super-seniors is a different kettle of fish. Here cleaning has to be optimum. Repeated alerts about how old people, especially those with co-morbidities (new jargon this writer learnt, as if lockdown life itself is not morbid) are vulnerable and need a close watch don’t offer the caregiver any comfort. An endless supply of hot water, fumigation (did you add turmeric?), etc., are keeping the woman on her toes while the fingers haven’t left the keyboard. Add to it energetic teenagers, whose craving for entertainment and a caterpillar-like appetite have to be respected. Frayed nerves have to be soothed and low spirits boosted.
Now, para one will make sense to the reader.
When will the lockdown lift and the women can return to a decent work schedule?
Meanwhile the Prime Minister has a task. After sound and light, he can think of a way to salute this particular species of women, which is working overtime to keep hearths and hearts warm. Is the PMO listening?",society

 ICRA said it reduced the growth forecast due to the nationwide lockdown imposed in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Concerns have morphed from the impact of imports from China on domestic supply chains into domestic and external demand shock, with social distancing and lockdowns leading to production shutdowns and job losses in some sectors,” ICRA said. Sectors that will be impacted the most are aviation, hotels, restaurants and tourism, auto dealerships, ceramic tiles, gems and jewellery, retail, shipping, ports and port services, seafood and poultry and microfinance institutions.
The impact on sectors such as automobiles, auto components, building materials, construction, chemicals, residential real estate, consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, logistics, banking, mining, paper, consulting, ferrous metals, footwear, glass, plastics, power and trading are going to be moderate.
“The low impact sectors will be education, dairy products, fertilisers and seeds, FMCG, healthcare, food and food products, insurance, telecom, utilities, sugar, tea, coffee and agricultural produce,” ICRA said.
The rating agency said extended demand disruptions are likely to lead to elongated payment cycles. 
“Since an entity’s liquidity position is of paramount importance to support its credit profile, it is expected that several entities would seek to conserve cash, either by invoking force majeure clauses to revoke payments or by deferring payments to the extent possible,” it said, adding this could result in many entities facing working capital blockage as their receivables get stretched and inventory not reducing simultaneously.",business

Virus forces corporates to rethink on hygiene ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-forces-corporates-to-rethink-on-hygiene/article31283221.ece,"The growing sense of personal hygiene, social distancing and safety following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has made people staying in paying guest (PG) accommodations and private hostels to move to facilities run by co-living companies that provide better living conditions, albeit at a slightly higher cost.
Last week, Tech Mahindra moved its staff numbering about 100 living in PG accommodation and elsewhere to a co-living facility run by Guesture at Electronics City, Bengaluru. More corporates are considering similar arrangements to protect their employees as the work-from-home culture is likely to continue.
Analysts said following the virus outbreak, the unorganised housing sector (PGs and private hostels) is facing major issues because of the health, hygiene, cleanliness, infrastructure, density and maintenance of the space during this hour of crisis. These places, according to them, are not best suited to adjust to work from home.
Sriram Chitturi, founder of Guesture and founding president of the Rental Housing Association of India said, “The transition from the unorganised to the organised sector has gained momentum. A lot of requests are coming from people and companies asking if we could accommodate them.”
“This mega trend is playing out in this industry. Earlier, when we cautioned them [corporates] about such living conditions, they were not that receptive. Today, COVID-19 has changed that attitude,” he added. 
He said companies themselves would realise that there should be emphasis towards hygiene, cleanliness and standardisation. 
“The unorganised players will be losing out substantially because governments have started enforcing rules on the number of people that can be accommodated in a particular space,” he said.
Besides, corporates have now realised that for their business continuity issues, their people must live and work from a place which does not lead to productivity loss. ",business

Since there is no vaccine or proven treatment, social distancing is the primary way to flatten the curve. However, communities have not had a lot of insight into whether their guidance is working’’ said Google Maps.
In its first COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (https://www.blog.google/technology/health/covid-19-community-mobility-reports), the company said, “Just like how people can use Google Maps to identify when a local business tends to be the most crowded, we’re using the same aggregated, annonymised data to provide high-level insights into what has changed.’’
People can visit the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports website, pick their country and download a PDF that charts the percentage increase or decrease of movement across different high-level categories of places—such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. 
The reports will show a percentage increase or decrease, rather than the absolute number of visits. The reports use aggregated, anonymised data to chart movement trends over time by geography. 
“We will release these reports globally, providing national trends for 130-plus countries. We think these reports could support decisions about how to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Information about changes to essential trips can shape recommendations on business hours or inform delivery service offerings,’’ added the company.",business
Developers sitting on ₹3.7 lakh cr. in unsold inventory,https://www.thehindu.com/business/developers-sitting-on-37-lakh-cr-in-unsold-inventory/article31283204.ece,"The COVID-19 spread in India has added to the woes of the real estate sector, which is saddled with huge unsold inventory.
The January-March quarter of 2020 has witnessed an increase in unsold inventory as launches outpaced sales by a significant margin. 
Unsold inventory increased from 4,42,228 units in the last quarter of 2019 to 4,55,351 units in the first quarter of 2020, according to a report by JLL.
In this period, Mumbai surpassed Delhi NCR to become the market with the maximum quantum as well as value of unsold inventory, the real estate consulting firm said. “Across the top seven cities, developers are sitting on an unsold inventory worth ₹3.7 lakh crore at the end of March 2020,” JLL said.
“An assessment of years to sell (YTS) reveals that the expected time to liquidate this stock has increased marginally from 3.2 years in the last quarter of 2019 to 3.3 years in Q1 2020. With anticipated slower sales in the coming quarters, the time to sell is likely to increase,” it said. “Having said this, the RBI’s intervention to provide a 3-month moratorium on all term loans by financial institutions will alleviate short-term liquidity concerns and help developers survive in these uncertain times,” it added.
Despite the concerns of the outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries, the January to March quarter saw a 3% increase in new launches of residential units compared to the same period last year. 
Out of total new launches of 40,574 units in the top seven markets, Mumbai and Bengaluru accounted for nearly 60% of the overall launches during the quarter.
JLL said a rebound in India’s residential property market will be influenced by the intensity, spread and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It said homebuyers deferred their purchase decisions due to the evolving situation around COVID-19, which led to sales declining by nearly 30% in the January-March quarter year-on-year. “The impact of the ongoing pandemic on business activities has become more prominent since the beginning of March 2020,” the report added.
The situation is likely to aggravate the liquidity challenges faced by developers and restrict new launches for some time after normal business conditions are restored, it added.",business

The hiring activity showed early signs of slowdown starting from the month of January 2020 where the index grew by only 5.75% followed by no growth in February 2020.
The decline in hiring activity is led by industries like hotel/restaurant/travel/airlines (56%), retail (50%), auto/ancillary (38%), pharma (26%), insurance (11%), accounting/finance (10%), IT-software (9%) and BFSI (9%).
The job market across cities too registered a dip in hiring activity. The decline was led by metros wherein Delhi declined by 26% followed by Chennai and Hyderabad at 24% and 18% respectively. There was an across the board decline in hiring activity at experience levels as well with senior experience bands ( greater than 13 years experience) witnessing the sharpest decline of 29% while the entry-level experience band (0 to 7 years) saw a decline of 16%.
Commenting on the report, Pawan Goyal, Chief Business Officer, Naukri.com, said, “The pandemic has impacted Y-o-Y growth in hiring activities, leading to an 18% decline. The negative sentiment on hiring was visible in the JobSpeak index starting January 2020, mirroring the economic trends. The hiring activity for the first 20 days of March 2020 saw only a 5% decline. However, due to the nationwide lockdown, there was a substantial drop in recruitment activity in the last 10 days which resulted in an overall drop of 18% in hiring. Industries like hotel, travel, aviation and retail have declined the most.” 
 Other key industries that showed a decline in hiring activity in the said period were — retail (50%), auto/auto ancillary (38%), pharma (26%), insurance (11%), accounting/finance (10%), IT-Software (9%) and BFSI (9%).
Some of the key industries like IT, BPO/ITES, BFSI and accounting/finance that form a significant base of hiring activity in India within the white-collar segment have shown a lesser decline during these unprecedented times. As compared to the overall JobSpeak index decline of 18% during March 2020 Y-o-Y, the hiring activity in IT-Software industry declined by 9%, IT-Hardware by 7%, Accounting/finance by 10%, BFSI by 9% and BPO/ITES by 1% only.",business

India is the world’s third-largest energy consumer, but the lockdown has shut businesses, suspended flights, stopped trains and brought almost the entire vehicular movement to a halt, impacting fuel demand.

For the full the month of March, total retail volume has come down by 17%, led by a 26% dip in diesel demand and a 17% fall in petrol. Demand for aviation fuel is down by 33%, according to the national data shared by IOC on a year-on-year basis.
The only fuel that saw a demand spike in the month was cooking gas that, too, after panic buying since the national lockdown. Overall, LPG demand rose 1.7% in the month, according to the IOC data.

There are 27.59 crore active LPG customers in the country.
All the national companies have seen a massive spurt in demand for the cooking fuel as people resorted to panic buying, leading to an average 40% rise in demand in the first week of the lockdown.
While the IOC, which controls more than 50% of the market, did not share its sales data, both BPCL and HPCL have said their diesel and petrol sales have fallen by over 55%.

HPCL Chairman Mukesh Kumar Surana told PTI that the refinery throughput has come down to around 70%.
While the Vizag refinery is running at full capacity, the same at Mumbai is only around 80%, he said.
From the demand side, he said even though all the filling stations are open there is hardly any demand. While diesel demand is down 40% as trucks are off the roads, petrol demand has more than halved as people remain indoors because of the lockdown. Only emergency service vehicles are on the roads. There is practically no demand for ATF too, he said.
R. Ramachandran, the refinery director at BPCL has the same thing to narrate. While refineries are running at under 70%, from the demand side the story is more disappointing.
“Our diesel and petrol sales are down over 60% and there is virtually no demand for ATF as only a few cargo flights are operational,” he told PTI. However, he expects diesel demand to improve as more trucks come on to roads to deliver essential goods and e-commerce deliveries join them as the lockdown remains in force.
But the companies are fearing inventory losses due to the massive plunge in demand.
Though the company has only minimal inventory level, Mr. Ramachandran said losses are sure for the month and April and going forward if the lockdown extends .
However, HPCL chairman expressed confidence about managing inventory as he looks to export some fuel if the lockdown gets extended.
Mr. Surana also said that since HPCL is a net buyer of refined products, the company is regulating its throughput so that we can avoid shutdowns and the resultant inventory losses.",business
Actor Paul Schneider on new sci-fi show 'Tales From The Loop': 'These are stories about heart',https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-paul-schneider-on-new-sci-fi-show-tales-from-the-loop-these-are-stories-about-heart/article31282913.ece,"When the world has escaped coronavirus, American actor Paul Schneider wants to revisit Italy. While the European country is currently languishing in a COVID-19 crisis, videos that have emerged of citizens singing to each from balconies have tugged heartstrings everywhere. Human connections have transcended isolation, despair, quarantine and continue to bring people together across cultures. It particularly resonates with the 44-year-old actor, whose new show Tales from the Loop, “Explores what makes us all similar, but also gives us a new perspective on understanding things we all know.""
The new show which recently dropped on Amazon Prime Video draws its inspiration from an unlikely source: Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag’s art book of the same name. His beautifully austere and striking works have formed the essence of Tales from the Loop. But showrunner Nathaniel Halpern brings different direction to each episode, with experienced hands like Mark Romanek, Charlie McDowell and even Jodie Foster. Though the show’s slow seethe is the result of the creator’s ability to birth anticipation and a restrained visual cerebral language. “The challenge was really in [what Halpern] wrote,” reminisces Schneider. “That’s the kind of challenge you want that puzzle out and unlock the best version of the material.” Prepping for the birth of a new baby in a few weeks, Schneider is certain that Tales from the Loop will particularly hit home during these times of social distancing. The need for connection has never been as imperative as it is during a quarantine lockdown.

‘Tales from the Loop’ review: A beautifully-shot poetic puzzle




 

‘Tales from the Loop’ review: A beautifully-shot poetic puzzle

Widely touted as a science-fiction endeavour, Tales from the Loop is actually, Schneider insists, a deep dive into human emotions. Its genre is merely a tool to unlock universal mysteries. “For science fiction to be effective we have to care about a character and that’s true for a story that’s set in space or a story is set in a Southern courtroom like To Kill to kill a Mockingbird,” says the actor. “These are stories about heart, they’re not about nostalgia or science. They’re stories about empathy.”
Augmented with a bionic arm, Schneider’s character George is teaching himself on a daily basis to be the father his own parent never was. “So in a way it’s a microcosm of the show,” reiterates the actor. “You have this robot arm, an element of science fiction but the core of the character is about family, secrets, love and loss.” Plus, portraying the physical delivery of an artificial limb, which took anywhere from 45 extra minutes to three hours in make-up, pushed Schneider’s boundaries. Strapped with a brace, tape and other apparatus, George had to be effortless on screen as he visually translated the character’s internal struggles. Like for instance in a sequence, Schneider’s favourite, that witnessed George row a boat towards information he’s desired for his whole life. “He’s not sure if he wants to know the answer, but he needs to know, recalls the actor. “I remember shooting that day and it was beautiful, a day that you feel lucky being able to go to work.”
The show’s ubiquitous appeal had Schneider lassoed in from the start, a lure that has drawn the actor to creative collaborations since his career first started in 2000 with George Washington. Filmmaking happened to satisfy his eternal yearning for connections that would resonate far and wide. “The script is the score and we are all working to play it perfectly,” he concludes, likening the process to a well-oiled symphony. “These were things I was interested in before the coronavirus and obviously these are things that more poignant at this moment.”

Actor Purab Kohli says that he and his family are diagnosed with coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-purab-kohli-says-that-he-and-his-family-are-diagnosed-with-coronavirus/article31281303.ece,"Rock On!! actor Purab Kohli, who is in London, took to Instagram to reveal today that he and his family have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, and are taking all the measures to stay safe.
The Bollywood star and former VJ wrote a lengthy post in which he revealed that their flu-like symptoms revealed that they were diagnosed with COVID-19, and that his daughter Inaya was the first person to get it. His wife Lucy Payton and baby son Osian Nur are also recovering from the virus, stated Purab.
He wrote on Instagram, “Hey guys, we’ve just had a flu and given our symptoms our GP says we were down with Covid 19. Pretty similar to a regular flu with a stronger cough and a feeling of breathlessness.”
“Inaya got it first and very mild. A cough and a cold for two days. Then Lucy got it more in the chest, quite similar to the cough symptom everyone has been talking about. Then me, I got a solid cold for one day which was horrid then it vanished and this irritating cough set in for 3 days. Three of us had only mild 100-101 temperatures and fatigue. Osian got it last with a 104 fever for 3 nights. Also, a runny nose and a slight cough. His fever disappeared only on his 5th day,” explained the actor.

"Stephen Fry posts about his collection of ties while social distancing, using hashtag ‘FryTie’",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/stephen-fry-posts-about-his-collection-of-ties-while-social-distancing-using-hashtag-frytie/article31279830.ece,"“Any object that self-identifies as “CRAZY” (especially in a wacky font) ought to be unceremoniously burned.” Who better to roast Stephen Fry than Stephen Fry himself?
The English actor, comedian and writer, much like all of us, has been debating on what to do while practising social distancing. And after a rather exciting morning sorting his ties last week, Fry has started a daily series of #FryTie posts on his Instagram (@stephenfryactually). Each day, he picks out a random tie from the “ridiculously large” collection he has assembled so far.
 

         View this post on Instagram           A Mad March Hare (two days late) - or more correctly a Loony one. Novelty ties, eh? Tchuh! I don’t know who “Leeds International” are/were.

And along with the tie’s picture, is an associated piece of trivia on the designer, the fashion scene in the 80s, or delicious anecdotes from his life — all delivered with his trademark dry wit.
So far, the ties have fluctuated between being classy, novelty and plain bizarre. Sharing one of Tommy Nutter’s designs — a beauty in blue with splotches of what look like hexagonal benzene rings — he describes the iconic tailor’s legacy.
“As much a feature of the 60s as David Bailey, Twiggy and the Mini. Son of a café owner he rose to “reinvent the Savile Row suit”... Amongst the great achievements of Nutter the Cutter was the dressing of three of the four Beatles on the Abbey Road cover. George opted out and plumped for denim. One of his last creations was Jack Nicholson’s suit for his role as the Joker in the 1989 Tim Burton Batman. Clients included Mick Jagger, Elton John, even Stephen Fry apparently (made for a film role, though understandably Nutter tried to hush this up: clothes hang on Fry like sacking on a hedge),” he writes.
It isn’t surprising that Stephen Fry’s collection of ties is as colourful as the man himself. His ties were on proud display during the course of the television game show Qi, which he hosted from 2013 to 2015. It even briefly inspired a loyal, if under the radar, Facebook community called Stephen Fry’s Fantastical Ties.
The most entertaining of his ties so far have been the bold and dashing ones, including a yuppie specimen made by American designer Nicole Miller (toiletries seems to be the theme here). “Restrained taste has its place but sometimes a dash of vigour and silliness can cheer one up, no?” asks Fry.
Quite expected from the man who wrote an ode to ‘Camp’ fashion in his memoir, Moab is a Washpot. One only wonders though, how his on-screen alter-ego, Jeeves’ upper lip would react to this.",movies

‘The Valhalla Murders’ review: Netflix Nordic-noir is a compelling watch,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-valhalla-murders-review-netflix-nordic-noir-is-a-compelling-watch/article31279391.ece,"The Valhalla Murders, the first Icelandic series to be streamed on Netflix, is pretty standard issue Scandi-noir— and that is not a bad thing. Old sins, as always, cast long shadows. There is a serial killer who seems to be targeting older people, slashing their eyes post-mortem. What is the connection between the victims and perpetrator? Is it Valhalla, the abandoned boys’ home that operated in the ‘80s? The lead investigator, Kata, has a lot on her plate. She is divorced, fighting substance abuse issues, dealing with her 16-year-old son who might have been involved in a horrific crime, and has been overlooked for promotion.
A profiler, Arnar, reluctantly returns home to Reykjavik from Oslo to help in the investigation. He has secrets of his own too — an ailing father he is not willing to forgive and a cowed sister he does not wish to be in contact with.
As always, it is a joy to hear a different language, experience another culture and see a whole new landscape. The brilliant blue of the Icelandic skies, the stark white of piles of pristine snow with a lone car winding through paints a singular picture of magnificent isolation. The dazzling azure skies contrast sharply with the dank basement in Valhalla where all manner of horrors are perpetuated.
Language-wise, even though some nuances might have been lost in translation, it is preferable to have characters talk in their native language. No matter how good Kenneth Branagh was as Wallander in the BBC adaptation of Swedish author, Henning Mankell’s police procedurals, it was strange hearing Wallander speak in English. It was as strange as Daniel Craig's Mikael Blomkvist talking in English in David Fincher’s adaptation of the novel that started it all — Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
The Valhalla MurdersSeason: 1Episodes: 8Run time: 50 minutesCreator: Thordur PalssonStarring: Nína Dögg Filippusdóttir, Björn Thors, Sigurður Skúlason, Anna Gunndís Guðmundsdóttir, Víkingur Kristjánsson, Kristín Þóra Haraldsdóttir
Incidentally, the Swedish title of the novel was the stark Män som hatar kvinnor, meaning ""Men who hate women."" And while The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has an interesting ring to it, “Men who hate women” is a surgical strike at the heart of the book. Similarly, the original Icelandic title for The Valhalla Murders is Brot, which means violation. While The Valhalla Murders works as effective shorthand (all who thought of Led Zeppelin’s ‘Immigrant Song’ get a bonus point) to tell the distracted surfer that it is a police procedural, Scandi-noir with cold landscapes and brutal murders, Brot, goes to the core of the story. It speaks of the different violations in the story — of trust, faith, of the body and mind. What do you do when those who are meant to protect you, abuse you?
The Valhalla Murders also educates us on the fact that Icelandic police officers do not carry firearms — guns are kept in a special locker which requires a passcode to be opened — it makes for a thrilling sequence when Kata is trailing a suspect, who might be armed. There is also the morality of whether she was right in carrying the gun into the chase.
The cast comfortably inhabit their characters. Nína Dögg Filippusdóttir as Kata is as tightly wound up as her ponytail, doggedly pursuing leads in the face of mounting challenges. Björn Thors as Arnar personifies the reluctant return of the native, carrying the burden of both his physical and mental scars.
Sigurður Skúlason as the police chief Magnús creates an effective picture of an inherently good man, who made some wrong choices, while Anna Gunndís Guðmundsdóttir plays it straight as the newscaster Selma. The media is thankfully not portrayed as rapacious hell hounds who would sacrifice anything for ratings. They are portrayed the old-fashioned way as standing up for truth and justice. Víkingur Kristjánsson is the standard-issue small-town cop Hákon, who will not be browbeaten into ignoring truth and justice. Kristín Þóra Haraldsdóttir is Laufey, Arnar's sister who believes in family and also believes Arnar’s redemption comes only through forgiveness.
Inspired by a real-life incident that took place in Iceland in the 1940s at an institution for troubled boys, The Valhalla Murders is a taut, thrilling journey into the welfare-state-forged manacles of the mind.

He was 68.
His official website announced: “It is with profound sorrow that we must announce Jay’s death on the 4th of April due to complications arising from a COVID-19 infection.”
Benedict was known for playing Russ Jordan in James Cameron’s 1986 release “Aliens”, sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1979 sci-fi horror classic, “Alien”.
He also appeared in detective drama “Foyle’s War”, playing John Kieffer, a US Army officer and friend of Christopher Foyle, and also was in Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Dark Knight Rises’. He had recently starred in “Call The Midwife” and “Downton Abbey”.
Soon after the news of his death broke out, tributes poured in remembering the actor.
Vicki Michelle, who starred in “Allo Allo”, paid tribute to the “lovely man”.
She wrote: “Married to my lovely friend Phoebe Scholfield #AlloAllo My heart goes out to her and her family at this sad time #PhoebeScholfield @FreddieBenedict #LeoBenedict #SyncorSwim #COVID19.”
“Only Fools and Horses” actor John Challis wrote: “Strangest coincidence this morning—talking on the telephone to my brother in law & telling him that my old friend Jay Benedict died yesterday.”
His management wrote in their obituary: “Jay was born in California, but his family left the United States for Europe when he was a child. As a legacy of his itinerant childhood, he is English/French bilingual, and no slouch in Spanish and German, either. People meeting him in ‘real life’ are surprised that he sounds more English than American — but so would you if you’d lived in Europe for 50-odd years (some of them very odd indeed). This doesn’t, however, prevent most casting agents from insisting that he play Americans — which he does happily and, not entirely surprisingly, like a native.”
Benedict is survived by his wife Phoebe Scholfield and their two sons, Leopold and Freddie, as well as his daughter from his previous relationship.",movies

The actress shot to fame in her late 30s after playing legendary Bond girl Pussy Galore in the 1964 movie Goldfinger, starring alongside Sean Connery.
 It was only the third instalment in the storied spy franchise, and received critical acclaim and box office success.
“It’s with great sadness that we have to announce the death of Honor Blackman aged 94,” the family said in a statement Monday.
“She died peacefully of natural causes at home in Lewes, Sussex, surrounded by her family.
“As well as being a much adored mother and grandmother, Honor was an actor of hugely prolific creative talent.” Her family added she possessed “an extraordinary combination of beauty, brains and physical prowess, along with her unique voice and a dedicated work ethic.”
Blackman also became well-known in Britain for playing the character Cathy Gale in the popular 1960s TV spy series The Avengers alongside Patrick Macnee as the bowler-hatted John Steed.
 She learned judo for her role as the leather-clad Gale and her martial arts skills helped land her the iconic role of Pussy Galore.
“Today we mark the passing of a film icon, Honor Blackman who shall forever be remembered as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger,” Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said in a statement on Twitter.
“She was an extraordinary talent and a beloved member of the Bond family. Our thoughts are with her family at this time.” Among her other screen roles, Blackman played the goddess Hera in 1963 film “Jason and the Argonauts” and appeared in “Bridget Jones’s Diary“.
On television, she had guest appearances on “Doctor Who”, “Colombo” and “Coronation Street“.
Her long and successful career also included theatre roles in productions such as The Sound Of Music, My Fair Lady and Cabaret.
“RIP, ultimate Bond Girl and original Avenger, Honor Blackman,” film director Edgar Wright tweeted.
 British comedian and actor David Walliams was also among those to pay tribute.
“Farewell Honor Blackman,” he said on Twitter. “She will live forever as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.”
Blackman was five years older than Connery whom she starred opposite in “Goldfinger” and is thought to be the oldest actress ever to play a Bond girl.",movies

Hydroxychloroquine: publisher expresses ‘concerns’ about study,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/hydroxychloroquine-publisher-expresses-concerns-about-study/article31280828.ece,"About 10 days after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved the use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis by healthcare workers attending to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases, the publisher of an international journal — that published a study on the drug’s purported efficacy — has expressed “concerns” about the paper. The paper was published on March 17 in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.
Also read: Hydroxychloroquine shows potential to treat COVID-19, a preprint claims
ICMR’s approval was based on the recommendation of the National Taskforce for COVID-19. On March 31, the Health Ministry approved the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin for “patients with severe disease and requiring ICU management”. 
On April 3, a fortnight after the journal published the paper, the journal’s publisher the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy said: “ISAC shares the concerns regarding the above article published recently in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA). The ISAC Board believes the article does not meet the Society’s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.”

Researchers led by Didier Raoult of the University of Marseille, who carried out a trial on 26 COVID-19 patients, found “significant” reduction in viral load in more than half the number of patients at the end of six days of therapy. The paper, which did not include the data of six patients who were lost to follow-up and with one person dying, was published based on data of the first six days of a 14-day trial. The paper was published a day after it was submitted to the journal, and one of the authors was Editor-in-Chief of the journal.
Concerns about the paper were first raised by Elisabeth Bik, a Dutch microbiologist, in the medical blog Science Integrity Digest and on PubPeer, a website that allows independent scientists to publish post-publication review of scientific papers. Dr. Bik wrote that the “peer review was done in 24 hours, an incredibly fast time.” She also pointed out that one of the authors is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal.
In their expression of concern about the study, ISAC, however, observed: “The Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Jean-Marc Rolain, had no involvement in the peer review of the manuscript”. 
Soon after the U.S. President Donald Trump championed hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a White House press briefing on March 20 that there was “no evidence” that the drug could be used as a prophylactic or as a treatment for COVID-19 patients. He also said: “It was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.”
 Meanwhile, India is all set to join the World Health Organization’s multi-country “Solidarity trial” aimed at testing four drug combinations including chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Late last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment.
Soon after Mr. Trump backed hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, two Nigerians are reported to have overdosed on the drug. Also, a man in Arizona, U.S., died and his wife was hospitalised after they reportedly self-medicated with hydroxychloroquine. And a doctor in India died after taking two doses of the drug.",science

And it’s not clear when it will reappear again or where or under what conditions.
The flame arrived in Japan from Greece on March 26. After the Tokyo Olympics and the torch relay were postponed until next year, the flame was put on display in the northeastern prefecture of Fukushima. It was to remain on display through the end of April. 
Also read | Thousands flock to see Olympic flame in Japan despite coronavirus fears
It was removed after several days when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday issued a state of emergency in order to combat the coronavirus, which includes limiting large crowds. 
“Tokyo 2020 will now keep the flame in an undisclosed location to prevent people from gathering,” Tokyo organisers said in a statement to the Associated Press. 
Tokyo organisers are expected to keep the flame for the short-term. In the long-term, the flame is expected to be used by the International Olympic Committee as a promotion device and as a symbol of the fight against the pandemic. 
“The idea will be to keep this flame burning and showing it to the world,” Michael Payne, the former marketing director of the IOC,” told Associated Press in a recent interview. 
The flame is expected to reappear next year in Japan for the torch relay. But Payne, who no longer works for the IOC, hinted it could have a wider purpose. 
“The Olympic flame burning will provide a very powerful inspiration, a bright light as the world goes through these difficult times,” he said. 
Prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese organisers and IOC organised an international torch relay that went to about 20 countries. 
The worldwide tour was met by violent protests against China’s human rights record in Tibet and elsewhere. The flame was targeted at several stops including London, Paris and San Francisco. This forced organisers to reroute the relay to separate protesters and supporters. 
The chaos at the time was described as a “crisis” for the IOC by then-President Jacques Rogge. The IOC subsequently cancelled any future plans for a worldwide display of the flame. 
Any plan next year to take the flame on a world tour, or even a tour of Japan, will depend on the evolution of the virus. The same is true for holding the Olympics amid large crowds in just under 16 months.",other sports
The rise and fall of ‘Lollu Sabha’: Director Rambala on the untold story,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/the-story-behind-lollu-sabha/article31289313.ece,"There was an idea.
To bring together a group of people, to see if they could become something more than what they were.
It was a four-page proposition for an inventive show — a first-of-its-kind for a television channel, which then was testing waters in the soap opera format and was looking for viable material to boost its TRP ratings. The idea, on paper, seemed bizarrely original and wildly funny, prompting a green light from the channel. But the decision, at that point, was perceived as a double-edged sword since none of the parties could remotely gauge the outcome of what they had created, in the first place.
There were no big names involved, no promotions and, in fact, not even a ‘it-is-coming-soon’ indication to the viewers. But when the show finally aired, it left the audience in splits for its distinct brand of arid humour; a liberal mix of satire, slapstick and some cringe-worthy punchlines. Families — which traditionally consumed tear-jerker serials — switched camp and became its allies; it replaced tea-time conversations with friends, became fodder for meme nation, and a template forcomedy shows. It gradually snowballed into a cult and understandably so, given how seriously it took the comedy business. If you still haven’t figured out, it is Lollu Sabha or should we say LoL-lu Sabha?
“Unlike today, there were no promos. So, people had no idea about such a show. Lollu Sabha, like the movies I have made, rode primarily on word-of-mouth factor,” says Rambala, creator and director of Lollu Sabha, who was instrumental in shaping the careers of actors Santhanam, Jeeva, Swaminathan and Yogi Babu among others.
Having worked as an assistant to directors Rama Narayanan and Bhagyaraj, Rambala landed the job of a script consultant, supervising Tamil content for Vijay TV, which was still under the wing of UTV group before it was formally acquired by the Star Group and rebranded as Star Vijay. He pitched the idea of Lollu Sabha to the then programming head Pradeep Milroy Peter who gave the ‘go-ahead’ signal, having been smitten by the concept.
Rambala was shouldering another show called Breakfast Show, which was divided into various segments dealing with multiple topics — of which one of the segments had a two-minute slot called Lollu Sabha, a satirical take on cinema and politics. But that never got aired. “Suresh Iyer [head of the channel then] motivated me to make that two-minute segment into a half-an-hour programme. That’s how Lollu Sabha came into place,” says Rambala, adding that he was given absolute freedom from the showrunners, “Issues began to crop up much later. But we’ll save that for later.”
The format of the show was deceptively simple: a no-holds-barred spoof of iconic Tamil movies that pokes fun and takes potshots at every major star, irrespective of their size and status. It was a cakewalk for Rambala since he was a habitual offender when it came to making jokes about anything and everything since his college days. “Every time I watched a movie, I would immediately make a joke or two. It would be pompous of me to say this but if you ask my friends, they would tell stories of how I used to make fun of people. In fact, my college professor [Kandasamy] used to call me direct-tuck-kare,” says Rambala, on being inherently funny.
But Lollu Sabha was not as easy as he imagined it would be, for he describes the initial few episodes as “walking on a tightrope”.
Making a parody out of an already hit movie requires a special skill set and a fair understanding of screenplay writing. Every movie that Rambala spoofed had a well-defined script but he says that the scripting process was as simple as the show itself. “We never took us seriously,” he begins, “I can safely say that we never sat and brainstormed for a scene or for a movie, which, I believe, is the success of the show. Comedy these days isn’t working because it’s concocted and put.”
Notes from the pastThe success of Lollu Sabha paved the way for a slew of comedy shows across channels. Rambala says that the show was akin to Thirukural and that it “keeps giving ideas”.During the peak of the show, the director thought of developing Lollu Sabha into a full-blown script. He, in fact, had a one-liner which he borrowed from an old Tamil movie. But the project never took off and then came a thunderbolt in the form of Tamizh Padam (directed by CS Amudhan), whose base idea was lifted from the show, claims the director.Now that he has made two movies with Santhanam (Dhilluku Dhuddu 1 and 2), how would he spoof his own movie if there was Lollu Sabha 2?. “I never ventured into the drama territory,” he says, “First, we spoofed movies, then artists, tv shows and even Gods [an episode titled High Court drew stiff comments from Hindu Makkal Katchi]. Why spare ghosts? Which is why all my movies are Lollu Sabha.
He reasons this out by explaining one of the earliest movies he (re)wrote, which was Nayakan. He has vivid recollection of what went into its making because that was when Balaji and Santhanam (“He struggled a bit initially, but I moulded him. Nobody can match his sense of timing.” ) joined his team. Rambala took the now-iconic scene of Velu Naicker reprimanding a doctor for failing to perform his duties and put a fresh spin to it. In LolluSabha’s version, titled V. Nayakan, it opens with the scene of a mother wailing in pain and seeking Velu Naicker’s help. Swaminathan, who reprises Kamal Haasan’s role, asks the lady what happened and she replies saying that her child swallowed a 50-paise coin. To which the character played by Manohar instinctively says, “Couldn’t you have stopped him when he swallowed two or three coins. Why wait till 50?”
In the 250-odd episodes he directed, Rambala says he would rewrite movies from scratch taking into account five to six vital scenes that would convey the essence, without disrupting the narrative. He says, “For instance, take the scene in Vanathai Pola where the elder brother [Vijayakanth] makes himself the shelter, in order to protect his brothers during rain. It was high on emotion but looked silly on screen. We picked those scenes.”

The unimaginable scale that Lollu Sabha peaked is not just restricted to it being rapturous comedy but also the way it imagined movie titles — Kadalora Kavithaigal was Kadalora Kazhuthaigal, Sindhu Bhairavi became Sindhu By Ravi, Mann Vasanai was Masala Vasanai, Chandramukhi was Chappamukhi and so on. “Whatever came to my mind was fixed as the title. There was one episode for which we couldn’t decide on the title. So it was called Peru Vekka Therilingo.”
The reception for Nayakan and for the ensuing episodes were overwhelming, urging the showrunners to rethink the timing of the show and it was reserved the 9pm primetime slot. “Never in our wildest dreams did we think that the show would be such a hit among people. The funny part is...we weren’t even aware of the ratings. All we were concerned about was our salary.”
But Rambala says he was left to survive on his own at the beginning, where there was no financial support from the showrunners. Recounting the time he and Santhanam struggled to buy a VCD of Baasha for a price of ₹20, the director says, “We used to run pillar to post to get the work done. At that time, Yugi Sethu was doing a programme for the World Cup. We had gone to that studio to get money to buy Baasha VCD,” he says, adding, “Both of us would watch it at midnight and note down important scenes because the next day, we would have to shoot.”
Funds for the show, though a tad minuscule, were streamlined only after it gained popularity. Until then, there were several restrictions in terms of budget and production. A maximum sum of ₹25,000 was sanctioned for each episode and it went up to a lakh at the height of its success. “I was very budget conscious and would finish it under ₹15,000. Though Lollu Sabha was hugely popular, our salary wasn’t much. Santhanam when he left earned about ₹1,500. People like Swaminathan might have earned ₹1,000 and Manohar would have got around ₹500,” he says.

Rambala has introduced a cohort of comedians — Swaminathan, Manohar, Ester, Seshu, Udhay, Jangiri Madhumitha — through the show, so much so that they were easily identifiable by the public with a prefix Lollu Sabha to their names. Of course, Santhanam was the most popular among the lot and was able to chart out a successful career in movies. Known for his eccentric body language and childlike innocence, Manohar was truly the asset of the show.
“There is a popular saying in Tamil: avarukumanasula onnum illa. But Manohar ku madailayum onnum illa,” he laughs, adding, “He is kind-hearted and knows nothing. It was a huge struggle working with him.” Rambala used to smoke three cigarettes a day before the start of the show. He jokes that he became a chain-smoker and began having BP during its course, courtesy Manohar.
“Nobody has annoyed me off like he did. He won’t get the dialogues right. I’d give inputs to him saying, ‘This is how you should say it’. But he would repeat whatever I said along with the dialogue when we went for the take,” he says, breaking into a laugh, adding, “He would take a minimum of 30 takes for a simple scene. But we had to tolerate it because he would be the one to score eventually.”
When asked about what happened to their lives post Lollu Sabha, he says, “We have been ignored by the channel. That’s the hard truth. We still haven’t gotten our due, despite running a successful show. Which is why I make it a point to rope in my Lollu Sabha team whenever I make a movie.”
They say you cannot make comedy without offending someone or something. This rings true with Lollu Sabha. The light-hearted nature of the show and its caustic humour held a mirror to the Tamil film industry, known for its star-worship culture. From yesteryear stalwarts such as Sivaji Ganesan and MG Ramachandran, superstars Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, to today’s stars Vijay and Ajith Kumar, nobody was spared.
Naturally, feathers were ruffled.
“Some of the actors took it sportingly. There have been instances where actors/directors themselves had expressed their wish to see their movies on Lollu Sabha. I once met actor Karthi who said he is big fan Lollu Sabha, so is Sivakarthikeyan,” says Rambala, adding that the channel received ‘letters of objection’ from Nadigar Sangam, sporadically.
LoL recommendationsThalapathiPudhupettaiMudhal MariyathaiThevar MaganKizhakku VaasalMudhalvan
Every time there was a complaint, he says that they would lie low for a week or so and would come up with other ideas like the famous Shooting Spot episode or the Raja one. Lollu Sabha also parodied television shows such as Arattai Arangam (Parattai Arangam), Kaun Banega Crorepathi (Phone Pannunga Umapathi) and Pattimandram (Idli vs Dosa) to name a few. “Then we started spoofing classics of MGR and Sivaji but people couldn’t relate to it, as they would do to a Vijay or an Ajith movie,” he says, “The channel was liberal in the initial years but slowly curtailed our voices.”
There seems to be a notion that Star Vijay decided to end the show following the infamous Bakery (Pokkiri) episode, for which they had to tender an apology, when fans took offence to the way Pokkiri and its star Vijay were made fun of. However, Rambala dismisses such claims, “Things got murkier when there was a change in the management. The show ended because of internal politics.”
“Even today, I can proudly say it was Lollu Sabha that got the channel the much-needed intial push. It’s true that there have been a lot of successful shows, but Lollu Sabha was the oil that kick-started that engine [Vijay TV].”
What, according to him, explains the crazy fan following it has accumulated over the years?
“It was a collective effort and wasn’t written or made for a single person, like the movie business. Everyone got the meat even if it wasn’t the lion’s share.”

How ‘Harry Potter’ and J.K. Rowling are giving hope to people during the pandemic ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/how-harry-potter-and-jk-rowling-are-giving-hope-to-people-during-the-pandemic/article31289237.ece,"“Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home,” replied J.K Rowling earlier last week in response to a fan, who thanked the British author for her stories being a wonderful escape, even in dark times.
It’s been 13 years since the last book in the series —Harry Potter and the Death Hallows — released in 2007, and nine since the movie adaptation (the second part) hit screens in 2011.
Yet, over the better part of the last two months, social media has seen an increasing influx of posts from users stuck in lockdown, who have turned to the Harry Potter books and movies in the franchise, as a means of coping with anxiety and fear from the coronavirus pandemic.
But it’s not just devoted fans who have grown up along with the boy wizard (and still resolutely work on their Percy Weasley Halloween costume every year) who are doing so; indeed, a new generation of first-time readers and watchers are being introduced to Rowling’s world by family and friends throughout the quarantine, and discovering what makes it quite so magical.

In several parts of the world, the eight movies in the series, which are hosted on platforms like Amazon Prime, Netflix, or telecast on television, are among the most-watched this year. Users are organising viewing parties from the safety of their homes, to experience the thrill of the adventures along with friends, albeit virtually. In China, Warner Bros. Studios have announced that a 3D-4K version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone will be used to revive Chinese cinema halls after they open following months of closure: an example that many other countries are keenly looking at following.
And at the centre of all this is Rowling herself, the author making a return to Twitter after a self-imposed break (“I thought I’d left forever,” she says) and writing about baking cakes, sharing adorable pictures of her dogs, and asking people to post pictures of the outside world… while also revealing that she’d recovered from a suspected bout of COVID-19 after two weeks of illness.

She even found time to give some sound advice to people feeling low about being unproductive during lockdown: “Implying that people are lazy or unmotivated if they aren’t knocking out masterpieces daily isn’t inspiration, it’s a form of shaming. If endless distraction cured depression, no rich person or workaholic would ever have killed themselves. Sadness and anxiety aren’t weaknesses.”

Fans are ecstatic at her constant retweets of their comments and were even more surprised at the launch of Harry Potter At Home, a digital hub to keep young children educated and entertained during the pandemic, with audiobooks, quizzes, videos and more.
It’s easy to see why the Harry Potter phenomenon is so popular even over a decade after the last book in the series was published: Rowling’s narrative mastery over a storyline that is forever relatable, characters made more memorable by a cast of child actors who have all gone on to become superstars, and a franchise that keeps on giving, from amusement parks to Broadway plays.

Yet, the fact that the tale, which begins with an 11-year-old orphan living in the cupboard under the stairs of his aunt’s house, continues to give hope to people across generations globally in times of crisis, makes for special news. Online fan-art and fiction have ranged from depicting the coronavirus as Dementors and positive thinking as people’s Patronuses, to cries for the likes of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson to do a virtual ‘reunion special’ and cheers fans up.
In India, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi requested citizens across the country to switch their lights for nine minutes to show a sense of solidarity against the ‘darkness’ of the coronavirus, many even compared it to Dumbeldore’s iconic quote from Prisoner of Azkaban (along with a spate of inspired memes): “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”

I have been re-reading my favourite parts from the book and it helps me ‘turn on the light’ at the end of the rather stressful days. Some passages, especially those that have Dumbledore’s lines, fill me with hope, in a time when it is very easy to lose clarity of the future.
Apart from that, I’m now very curious to know if the wizarding community gets affected by Pandemics like us mere mortals. Would it get cured by spells, or one of Madam Pomfrey’s awful tonics? If at all the wizarding world is real, now would be a great time to reveal themselves and save the world.
I love how Jo is back on Twitter, looking out for fans when they need it the most. The Harry Potter At Home initiative is a nice addition to the WW website and there are some fun quizzes and games to keep me occupied. The challenge would be to not finish all of them in one go!
Ruben Thomas, software engineer (Milan, Italy)
I was 8 years old when my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and he was the one who’d gifted me my first Potter book. During those days at the hospital, I used to take my copies with me, sit by his bed and read to him. There were many days where he was under chemo and we weren’t even sure if he was cognizant, but I’d hold his hand during my favourite bits in the books and he’d press back.
He recovered, made it back home and would continue to live a hearty life until he died 12 years later. That remains my lasting memory of my experience with JKR’s creation: something to be shared with the family, which holds us together tight in the toughest of times, and just maybe reminds you that there’s magic still left in this world.
I’m under lockdown in Italy with my wife and three-year-old daughter, and we just began reading the first book to her. Over the course of the next few months, I hope we, as people in today’s world, make kind and thoughtful decisions to get past this crisis, as that’s the only way forward. As Dumbledore said, it is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.

I’ve always been an avid reader, but I haven’t read any series as devotedly and as many times as I’ve read Harry Potter. The Potter Universe is my Patronus. I don’t remember a single time when I’ve been low where I haven’t turned to this series, and it has unfailingly saved me. Jumping into Hogwarts makes me feel better almost instantly.
Even though I’ve read each book at least 20 odd times before, when I look up from the pages I need a minute to reorient myself to my surroundings and that’s the best form of escape.
I’ve grown up with these characters, and there’s a part of me that’s inexplicably linked to the Universe that Rowling created — that’s the part I turn to when life gets difficult. I owe my imagination to the series as well, and as a result, so many other things including my career as a writer and my ability to turn on the light in the darkest of times and find happiness.
Especially now when there is so much uncertainty and chaos floating around, I need to escape into this world every now and then to manage any anxiety I may feel. See? Patronus.
Azhar Malik, media professional (Singapore)
For me, the series has always been about one defining trait: acceptance. Harry Potter taught me that it’s okay to be who you are, to believe in yourself, and you will find your family — even if it’s not the one you were born into.
Looking at the happenings in today’s world, there are so many other accompanying battles that make dealing with this pandemic so much more challenging, such as racism, ignorance and communal violence. This is where I believe the books and the movies will hopefully make a difference to even the next generation, and teach them to fight our battles together, as one.
My colleagues and I have been rewatching the movies, playing HP-themed trivia and costume nights, while also recommending the same to whoever we can. This world could badly use some magic today through our imagination: of course it’s happening inside your head, but why should that mean that it is not real?

I’m a first-time reader who is reading Philosopher’s Stone currently — what better way to get through quarantine? I’d never read it earlier because of how big of a fan my sister was. We’d stand in lines at midnight for her to buy the books and I was too young to read it.
Then we watched the movies as they came out as a family, and when I was old enough to start reading, I felt like I already knew what was going to happen and could never get past the first book! In the US, it’s really ingrained as a part of the culture and you’re looked down upon if you haven’t read the series, haha. But this is my chance to finish all the books during the lockdown, and I’m so glad we have a getaway like this.",entertainment
American folk singer John Prine dies from coronavirus at 73,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/american-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-from-coronavirus-at-73/article31287032.ece,"American folk legend John Prine has passed away due to the coronavirus complications. He was 73.
 Prine, whose coronavirus diagnosis was revealed on March 17, died on Tuesday, his publicist told Variety.
 His wife and manager, Fiona, had on April 3 posted on Twitter that Prine was severely ill after being admitted into intensive care unit of a hospital.
 In a career spanning over half a century, Prine churned out heartfelt and unforgettable songs like Angel From Montgomery, Sweet Revenge and In Spite of Ourselves.
 He was regarded as one of the greatest by many of his peers including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler and many other music legends. 
Born on October 10, 1946 in Maywood, Illinois, the singer-songwritter emerged on the Chicago folk scene in the late 1960s, when he was discovered by country star Kris Kristofferson.
 He is still remembered for his 1971 anti-war track Your Flag Decal Won’t Get You Into Heaven Anymore, which came at the height of the Vietnam War and is still relevant to many till date. 
In recent years, he had taken a step back from music but came back in 2018 with the album The Tree of Forgiveness. It was his first LP in 13 years.
 Prine was a winner of two Grammy awards for best contemporary folk albums: The Missing Years (1991) and Fair & Square (2005). He was an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and also bestowed with Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
The news of his demise sent shockwaves across the music industry, with stars like Bruce Springsteen, Kacey Musgraves, Bonnie Raitt, Bette Midler and others paying their tributes to the legend.
“Over here on E Street, we are crushed by the loss of John Prine. John and I were “New Dylans” together in the early 70s and he was never anything but the lovliest guy in the world. A true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages. We send our love and prayers to his family,” Springsteen wrote in a post on Twitter.
Raitt, who recorded Angel from Montgomery in the 1970s, said he is feeling crushed after learning about Prine’s demise.
“Words can’t even come close. I’m crushed by the loss of my dear friend, John. My heart and love go out to Fiona and all the family. For all of us whose hearts are breaking, we will keep singing his songs and holding him near,” he wrote.",entertainment
Friends across the fence: How Indians are coping with isolation,https://www.thehindu.com/society/friends-across-the-fence-how-indians-are-coping-with-isolation/article31289441.ece,"It is 20 minutes past six. Over a flowering flame tree, the evening sun is preparing for its dramatic exit. A 20-something year old and her sister are trying to emulate this scene on their drawing sheets, sitting on their terrace. They wave to a little girl zooming past them on a bicycle. In a corner, a six-year-old helps his mother pack dried rice vadagams into a container, and then offers to share them with the rest.
Seventeen days into lockdown, neighbourhoods seem to have accepted badminton games on empty corridors, singing lessons on balconies and conversations across compound walls as the new normal. Faced with unfamiliar, and unsettling isolation, people are seeking comfort by finding ways to reconnect with their neighbours, even as they diligently try and follow personal distancing rules, whether they live in crowded neighbourhoods or gated communities. 
The Italians sing patriotic songs from their windows; the French exercise together watching a trainer from their balconies. In India, interactions currently involve passing freshly made batches of molagapodi and steaming samosas across windows. Previously detached neighbours now smile and wave at each other from their terraces, many communicating for the first time in years, as life slows down. Children yell and chat across roads. Neighbours help each other out with buying groceries and medicine. Apartments band together to look after their elderly inhabitants. Young people make offers on social media to check in on strangers’ parents and grandparents, from a safe distance. 
All underlining the importance of community, and how this lockdown is strengthening neighbourhoods in unexpected ways. 
Terraces seem to be the new clubs, as people wave at each other from rooftops across the city. Fifty-year-old K Ramachandran heads up every evening at 5.30 pm to do his stretches and yoga. Mid-stretch, he says, “Now that I can’t be doing this outside, I have adapted to the situation. It’s much more breezy here! I come up everyday and spend about an hour exercising.” He also smilingly admits to ignoring the possibilities of the space all these years. “It’s almost like a different world up here.” 
At Coimbatore’s Parsn Sesh Nestle apartment complex, a balcony safari, of sorts, is in progress. “The peacock went that way!” a little girl shouts to her neighbours, helpfully pointing right. She is standing in the balcony of her home on the second floor, calling out to everyone who passes by below. This has become her window to the world. Her best friend’s balcony is right next to hers, so they spend most of the day standing there discussing what they ate for dinner, how many peacocks they spotted that day, and what the moon looked like the previous night. Another parent in the same building has made cloth hammocks in their balcony for their two daughters, so they can lounge as they join in.
Meanwhile, as groceries continue to be a challenge, Sujitha Manu’s neighbours in Pothencode, on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram, have a steady supply thanks to her kitchen garden, which is in full bloom with red amaranthus, brinjal, snake gourd, tomato and more. 
“We used to have a weekly organic bazaar on Saturdays. That has been cancelled.So I give it to my neighbours and friends. Every day, they call me to find out what’s available and I share the harvest with them,” says the State award-winning kitchen gardener.
In the same way, Ushakumari GS, a primary school teacher, and her husband, Suresh Kumar L, a retired Government employee, who live near Government Medical College in Thiruvananthapuram, share the produce of their kitchen garden which includes poultry and pisciculture, with their neighbours in Medical College East Residents’ Association. 
Meet-cutes in confinementTerrace romances have always been in vogue. But, in the lockdown season, some have found ingenious ways to make romance thrive in these unprecedented times.A New York-based photographer asked his neighbour out on a date, after he saw her dancing in her balcony, by flying a drone up to her on which he taped his phone and pressed the record button in TikTok. In what became an instantly viral video across social media platforms, the couple shared their first date on their respective balconies via FaceTime. The second date saw him rolling over to her home inside a plastic bubble to take a walk side-by-side. A Spanish couple, who had spent months planning their wedding, were disappointed on learning that their wedding ceremony would not see the light of day, but soon realised that nothing could stop them. Alba Diaz and Daniel Camino got married leaning out of their balcony, while their next-door neighbour led the ceremony. Several people came to their balconies to be witnesses. She even threw the bouquet to a friend who lived opposite her apartment.

“We can’t consume all the vegetables we grow. For instance, we harvest about 10 to 12 kilograms of ivy gourd. At present, we are able to give our neighbours all kinds of vegetables. Patients from the Regional Cancer Centre nearby reach out to us for eggs, which we give free of cost,” says Usha.
Stating that since the Chennai floods of 2015, Harsha Koda, secretary at Sabari Terrace, Chennai’s OMR says, “This, perhaps, is the longest time people have remained confined at home. He says they help each other via WhatsApp. “If someone is out for a grocery run, a message is sent to the common WhatsApp group, and others can add to the list.”
In Mumbai, restaurateur Gauri Devidayal, says she collates orders for bread from her apartment block so her restaurant, Mag St Bread Company can send everything in one order, and minimise deliveries. In at attempt to promote social distancing and make deliveries easier for small businesses, apartments, and neighbours are also clubbing together to order basics like gas cylinders and water cans. And since many of the restaurants are doing less business, they are finding ways to be good neighbours: making meals for the policemen and other essential workers in their areas.
If you’re lucky, you live next to a neighbour with fancy ingredients to spare, like Chennai-based Japtej Ahluwalia, best known for Double Roti, who posted a picture of a pizza he made with mozzarella cheese from their central kitchen, on Facebook. Realising that people are craving “something cheesy”, he announced that anyone who wants the cheese can DM him, and pick it up.
A semblance of normalcy is what these unexpected connections are creating at this point. At a time when social media has become our window to the world, something as simple as a smile from across the balcony is enough to remind us that we are all in this together.

"Lockdown life in Bengaluru proves challenging for students, working professionals",https://www.thehindu.com/society/people-with-disabilities-students-and-working-professionals-speak-about-staying-in-a-pg-in-bengaluru-during-lockdown/article31288316.ece,"
On a Saturday morning, members of Enable India, a Bengaluru-based NGO (founded by Shanti Raghavan and Dipesh Sutariya) that works towards economic independence and dignity of persons with disabilities, engaged in discussion on a Zoom call. The topic was COVID19: How persons with disabilities are coping with it. The discussion was part of Solutions Saturday, where they get together online every Saturday to address various issues being faced by the differently abled. 
The participants were from different parts of India, including Bengaluru, Pune and Kolkata. They described some of the challenges they faced particularly those staying in paying guest accommodations. One participant said: “After the lockdown was announced, some paying guest accommodations asked us to leave saying they were shutting down. The state governments is saying that those staying in paying guest hostels and flats need not pay a month’s rent, but not everybody abides by these rules. Some are saying to reduce ₹1000 and give the rest of the rent. Everyone is facing these issues, not just persons with disabilities.”
Camaraderie and warmth pervaded the meeting, with suggestions being given in case of any requirement. Among the participants was Deepa S, who has spinal muscular atrophy. She heads the DELL-EMC Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) for India. “persons with disabilities have always asked for work from home because it is not always possible to go to office and today the entire world is working from home. This could be a great window to enable people. Technology is playing a pivotal role. At the same time, I request persons with disabilities to be ahead of the curve, be it technology or understanding what the world is going through. Being ahead prepares us for some of these challenges.” 







Dipesh talked about the situation in Bengaluru. “On March 15, we suspended training at Enable India. The immediate problem was to see if people from Karnataka could return home. Most were able to get home on time. There are around 16 candidates from Assam and Orissa who could not return. They are still staying in PG accomodations. Our team was able to call and check with the PGs. Most of them assured us that they will not let the residents go and will provide for them even if they close down. Most PGs are running. One hostel faced a challenge of providing food. The inmates, however, were transferred to another hostel. Most of our candidates and staff are okay in the places where they are staying. One of the advantages, someone commented was that ‘I had three people in my room earlier but now I have the room to myself’.
“I have heard stories of PGs closing down. For the visually impaired, social distancing is a challenge. We got one of our candidates to our house. He is hearing and visually impaired so the only communication with him is by touch. Now he is living with us and is safe.”

A few days before the nationwide lock-down was announced, Sheila (name changed) was informed by her caretaker of the paying guest hostel in Marathahalli that she might have to look for temporary accommodation. “I could have returned home but I did not want to put either myself or my family at risk, so I decided to stay back,” says Sheila. After much back and forth, her caretaker asked her to vacate as most of the girls had gone home. “I think the caretaker was afraid that they might fall into trouble with the authorities, though BBMP has categorically announced that no paying guest accommodation should be closed. Almost all my friends had returned home. I went to a friend’s house, but even she had decided to leave.” With nowhere to go, Sheila requested the company she works in for help. They ultimately made arrangements for her to stay in a serviced apartment. 
Swati Verma, on the other hand, who stays in a PG accommodation in Madiwala that does not provide food, buying groceries has been quite a challenge — a fact all of us have to deal with. “Apart from the hassle of groceries, everything else is fine. As many girls have gone home following the announcement of lockdown, personal distancing is not a problem. Also for work from home, our caretaker constantly checks if the Wi-Fi is working, so we are being taken care of.”
For college student Akanksha, who stays in a PG hostel in Chikkasandra Layout, Koramangala the lockdown has been bearable. “We are getting food, the basics like dal and rice, tea (without milk) and biscuits, but it would be nice if the food could be better. The cooks, though, don’t have proper protective gear, and I hope something is done about it. Personal distancing is not a problem as most of the occupants have gone home.” 
Ravi S, who stays in a boy’s hostel in Koramangala, is grateful that he has a place to stay. “They are strict about not letting anyone leave or anyone enter. We are served simple meals, and the maids come to clean.” When asked if they are given protective gear, he answers in the affirmative. “They are wearing masks and are asked to wash their hands.”







 Dr. Nikhil Sikri, CEO & Co-Founder, Zolostays says they had anticipated the lockdown on March 1 itself. Nikhil, who completed his MBBS from AIIMS and holds a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, speaks of the steps they have taken for their co-living properties (there are about 140 Zolostays co-living properties across Bengaluru, including Manyata Tech Park, Electronic City, Marathahalli, Koramangala, HSR, among others, and about 10,000 students and working professionals between the age group of 20 and 30 years staying there). “We stocked food for one and a half months. We have stopped all visitors from entering, and even if an occupant goes out to buy groceries we ensure that they are safe. We have a doctor on call. We have strong awareness and monitoring of symptoms. We are pro-active in co-operating with the government and medical authorities. We have changed the housekeeping schedule from twice a week to thrice a week. Our housekeeping staff is taken care of by providing them with masks, hand sanitisers, and gloves. We also disinfect frequently-touched surfaces. We have provided hand sanitisers to all the occupants.” ",society

ICRA to maintain negative outlook on CVs,https://www.thehindu.com/business/icra-to-maintain-negative-outlook-on-cvs/article31292935.ece,"Ratings agency ICRA on Wednesday said it continued to maintain a negative outlook for the commercial vehicle (CV) segment over the near-term as the COVID-19 outbreak had added to the current challenges faced by the sector in terms of slow economic growth, overcapacity and a difficult financing environment.
The agency expected the volumes for the segment to contract further by 8-10% in FY2021.
According to ICRA, the demand headwinds are expected to continue over the near-term given the macroeconomic challenges due to the pandemic outbreak coupled with weakening financial profile of fleet operators and significant price hikes because of transition to BS-VI emission norms.
“This would exert pressure on earnings and overall credit profile of CV original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which have witnessed sharp earnings contraction over the past 3-4 quarters,” it said.
Shamsher Dewan, V-P, ICRA, said the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (truck) segment, which has seen a decline of 42% in volumes in year-to-date (YTD) FY2020, is likely to close FY2021 with a further decline of 12-14%. “The outlook for the next fiscal, especially the first half, remains weak. Any recovery in the latter half hinges on pick-up in construction activity,” he said.
For the light commercial vehicle segment (truck), volumes are likely to contract by 7-9% during FY2021. Despite the rural demand sentiment witnessing an uptick in recent months, supported by expectations of a healthy rabi output, ICRA expects the outbreak of COVID-19 and the associated lockdown and restricted movement of goods to have a bearing on the segment over the near term.
Likewise, the passenger carrier segment, while being relatively insulated from the impact of reduced load availability, is also expected to report demand contraction of 8-10% in FY2021.
Mr. Dewan added, “With cash flows of fleet operators under pressure, replacement demand for new trucks is likely to remain muted till any meaningful pick-up in the economy and infrastructure projects fructify.”
“Furthermore, any unsold BS-IV inventory and their write-off can also exert pressure on CV OEM’s profitability. Accordingly, ICRA expects profitability and credit metrics of CV OEMs are likely to remain under pressure over the near-term,” the ratings agency said.",business
Global trade will plunge by up to a third in 2020 amid pandemic: WTO ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/global-trade-will-plunge-by-up-to-a-third-in-2020-amid-pandemic-wto/article31292908.ece,"Global trade growth is expected to plummet by up to a third in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the World Trade Organisation said on Wednesday, warning that the numbers would be “ugly“.
 “World trade is expected to fall by between 13% and 32% in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts normal economic activity and life around the world,” the WTO said in a statement.
 There were a wide range of possibilities for how trade would be hit by the “unprecedented” health crisis, it added.
 However, WTO chief Roberto Azevedo warned the downturn “may well be the deepest economic recession or downturn of our lifetimes.”
 In its main annual forecast, the 164-member WTO pointed out that trade had already been slowing in 2019, before the emergence of the novel COVID-19.
But the virus has now infected some 1.4 million people since late last year, killing more than 80,000 and forcing governments across the world to take radical measures.
 More than half of humanity has been asked to stay at home and economic activity has ground to a virtual standstill in many places.
 Global trade, already hit by trade tensions and uncertainties around Brexit, is expected to register “double-digit declines in trade volumes” in nearly all regions this year, the WTO said.
 “This crisis is first and foremost a health crisis which has forced governments to take unprecedented measures to protect people’s lives,” Mr. Azevedo said in a statement.
 “The unavoidable declines in trade and output will have painful consequences for households and businesses, on top of the human suffering caused by the disease itself,” he said.
 Before the current crisis, trade tensions, uncertainty and slowing economic growth weighed on global merchandise trade, which registered a slight decline of 0.1% in 2019 after rising 2.9% a year earlier.
 The dollar value of world merchandise exports fell by three per cent to $8.89 trillion, the WTO said.
 World commercial services trade fared better last year, with exports in dollar terms rising by 2% to $6.03 trillion, but the expansion was far slower than in 2018, when services trade increased by 9%, said the WTO.
 But the situation has taken a dramatic turn since the new coronavirus first emerged in China late last year.
 The WTO said that while the global shock might invite comparisons to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the situation now was worse.
 “Restrictions on movement and social distancing to slow the spread of the disease mean that labour supply, transport and travel are today directly affected in ways they were not during the financial crisis,” it said.
 “Whole sectors of national economies have been shut down, including hotels, restaurants, non-essential retail trade, tourism and significant shares of manufacturing.” 
Developments remained very uncertain, said the WTO.
An optimistic outlook posits that a sharp drop in trade will be followed by a recovery starting in the second half of 2020, said the organisation.
 But the more pessimistic view is that the initial decline will be steeper and the recovery will be “prolonged and incomplete.”
 “Under both scenarios, all regions will suffer double-digit declines in exports and imports in 2020”, it said, adding that North America and Asia would be hardest hit. ",business
Tata Elxsi increases focus on healthcare innovation ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tata-elxsi-increases-focus-on-healthcare-innovation/article31292811.ece,"Tata Elxsi, a Tata Group company that offers services supported by design thinking and digital technology, has decided to increase its focus on the healthcare segment. 
Though healthcare currently accounts for less than 10% of its total business, it has been the fastest-growing segment for the company and this year it is set to grow over 100% over last year.
Tata Elxsi works with one of the leading players of the likes of GE, Philips and Siemens, but a lot of its work comes from a number of privately-held, not so well-known to the public, companies in Europe and the U.S. that report annual revenues in the range of $2-10 billion. 
These companies provide specialised products that are used for the care of certain critical health issues. It could be related to kidney, it could be related to some surgeries, specific equipment used in the ICUs or it could be part of certain infusion pumps to deliver the right quantity of drugs in critical care units. 
Manoj Raghavan, CEO & MD, Tata Elxsi told The Hindu that: “We are currently working on some of the incredibly complicated and sophisticated devices for our customers. Some of these devices are still in the R&D stage. They include a portable dialysis kit that will greatly improve the quality of life for patients. We do the research, design and development of software for a wide variety of innovative healthcare devices.’’
The company has developed quite a few technologies and devices to its credit. For instance, it has developed something called the ‘negative wound pressure therapy’ system. Explaining the product, he said, if a person has an accident or if one has a major wound that needs proper treatment, the device sucks up all the fluids, pus and all other debris. It helps in healing the wound faster. It’s a very sensitive device and it does not destroy the healthy tissue.
The company builds prototypes and then it transfers the technology to its customers. The company has marquee names among its customers to which it supplies the medical technologies developed by it. 
The firm has also developed a technology to ensure how much fluid should go into a patient in critical care, and then remove toxins from the body. “The removal of toxins is all controlled by software. The software tells you when you should replenish the stocks. It has a lot of sensors to help in the process,” Mr. Raghavan added.
As of now, about 48% of Tata Elxsi’s business comes from the automotive sector, and about 35% from the media and broadcast and the rest from medicl devices. The company is currently in the process of reducing its dependence on automotive space by increasing its focus on health.",business

Ltd., which has witnessed a washout of its business for the first quarter, is anticipating a 10% to 15% drop in its sales volume on an annualised basis for the current year, said a top executive.
“Generally, our financial year begins in February. Our first quarter has gone for a toss and we don’t anticipate much of a sales till August. In other words, it would be a complete washout for us,” said N. Mohan, executive director and CEO, Clarks India. “In fact, we don’t know when we will be allowed to retail our footwear. Even if the retail outlets opens in May, we can see some business only from June/July onwards,” he said.
According to him, Clarks India witnesses 40% of its annual business in the first half and 60% in the second half. Due to the current scenario, business in the first half will be lower by 50% in terms of pairage compared with the planned growth of 30%.
Till date, Clarks India has honoured all the orders placed with its suppliers. It is likely to cancel or hold back two lakh pairs of shoes for the autumn and winter seasons.
“Last year, we sold 8.7 lakh pairs clocking a growth of 45%. And this year, we raised our target to 1.2 million pairs with an anticipated growth rate of 30%. Going by the current trend, we might end the year with a contraction,” he said. 
In retail value terms, sales would be ₹420 crore for the current year against ₹400 crore for last year.
Clarks outsources 60% its products from Indian suppliers, 35% from Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam and less than 3%-4% from China. “Even if there are no supplies from China, it would not hurt us,” he said.
Asserting that they would end up selling 8.5 lakh pairs of shoes, he said that they are betting on e-commerce for sales against brick and mortar models, which would take time to recover. However, the company was not going back on its proposed expansion of exclusive branded outlets or retail touch points, he said adding that it would be done as per the government’s directive.
India accounts for 90% of Clarks’ revenue and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal the balance. 
“Due to the pandemic, strong brands like Clarks will emerge stronger and we expect market to stabilise after September,” he said.
Clark planned to sell three million pairs in three years. All these will get postponed by a year, he said.",business
Centre seeks suggestions to revive textile industry ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-seeks-suggestions-to-revive-textile-industry/article31292643.ece,"Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday constituted four committees to come up with suggestions on how the textile and clothing industry could be revived post the COVID-19 crisis. The committees, with representation from the industry and the Ministry, will come out with suggestions in a week. 
A textile association head, who participated in the video call with the Minister, said the committees would explore how industries could re-start production in a phased manner, the financial needs of the sector, promoting Indian brands, and how exporters could tap the potential in the global market once the crisis is over. The committees, with members from the industry and the Ministry, will come out with suggestions in a week and discuss it.
The Union Ministry of MSMEs has also sought suggestions from the industry on how MSME associations could ensure social distancing and other safety norms when the units reopen after the lockdown period.
The Coimbatore District Small Industries Association said that the units would restart production only when the Central and State governments gave the nod and did not prefer phased re-opening as there was the risk of the virus spreading. The government should provide fitness certificates to all workers so that they can return to work.
Norms such as social distancing may be difficult to practice in micro and small units. But the MSMEs would do their best to follow all the prescribed procedures.
Naushad Forbes, co-chair of Forbes Marshall and former president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said that manufacturing activities continued in several countries that are affected by COVID-19.
Manufacturing should not be distinguished as essential or non-essential and should be permitted to resume operations in a phased manner. Industries should also put in place all the required precautionary measures, not only on their premises but also in the supply chain, he said.",business
IRDAI permits insurers to grant three months’ moratorium on term loans ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-permits-insurers-to-grant-three-months-moratorium-on-term-loans/article31292641.ece,"The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has permitted insurers to grant a moratorium of three months on repayment of term loans sanctioned by them.
The decision follows representations from industry associations to the regulator, seeking moratorium on repayment of term loans sanctioned by insurers in the context of COVID-19 outbreak. 
Considering the cash flow problems faced by the borrowers and in line with the recent directions of the RBI on moratorium on term loans, insurers are permitted to grant a moratorium of three months towards payment of instalments falling due between March 1 and May 31, IRDAI said. 
The repayment schedule for such loans and also the residual tenor will be shifted across the board by three months subsequent to the moratorium period. Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during such moratorium period, HOD – Investments of IRDAI S.N. Jayasimhan said in a circular to all insurers.
Directing insurers to frame board-approved policies to extend the moratorium to all eligible borrowers, IRDAI said the asset classification of term loans that are granted the relief should be determined on the basis of revised due dates and revised repayment schedule. The rescheduling of payments, including interest, will not qualify as a default for the purpose of reporting of non-performing assets (NPAs). 
Concurrent auditors in their reports for the quarter ending June 2020 shall confirm that the insurers had complied with the Board Approved policy in granting moratorium, IRDAI said.",business

“However, the situation has become highly critical now with total outstanding dues from these PSUs amounting to approx. ₹20,000 crore which has been pending for long,” Rajan Mathews, DG at COAI, said in the letter dated April 8.

Sensex sees worst monthly fall in 11 years ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sensex-sees-worst-monthly-fall-in-11-years/article31292632.ece,"The equity markets may well be going through one of the most volatile phases ever, but the magnitude of stock specific fall has never been this intense in any of the previous bear cycles.
In March, when the Sensex had its worst monthly fall in over 11 years — it fell little over 23% — there were at least five trading sessions when more than 1,000 stocks hit their 52-week lows in a single session.
Further, as per BSE data, more than 1,300 companies —nearly 59% of the total number of entities traded - saw their shares hit their 52-week low on March 13, which was the most volatile session ever for the benchmark that traded in a range of 5,400 points on that day. Incidentally, it was also the day when the Nifty hit its lower circuit breaker of 10% —the first time ever in 12 years. Similarly, on March 24, when the Sensex touched its own 52-week low of 25,638.90, as many as 1,133 stocks touched their respective such lows.
Market participants believed that the trend only showed that there was a huge underlying weakness in the market even as the benchmarks have gained significantly in some of the recent trading sessions — the Sensex has gained nearly 17% from its lows touched last month.
“In March, investor confidence was at its lowest in many years due to coronavirus pandemic and its potential global economic impact, massive surge in VIX and an all-time record high selling by foreign Investors,” said a head of a domestic brokerage.
“In fact, even during the record run in January, the mood was not so upbeat as only few stocks outside the benchmarks touched new highs. That says a lot about the current trend,” he added.
This is corroborated by the fact that only 126 stocks touched their 52-week high on January 20 when the Sensex touched its all-time intra-day high of 42273.87.

"Post lockdown, CII for phased reopening",https://www.thehindu.com/business/post-lockdown-cii-for-phased-reopening/article31292575.ece,"Amid talks over over extending the 21-day nationwide lockdown, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has suggested to the government to follow a phased reopening plan with sectors such as manufacturing and construction, that provide mass employment, re-started first.
The CII also sought a fiscal support package for FY21 limited to 2% of the GDP to support the lowest strata and the informal sector and ₹2 lakh crore be transferred to JAM account holders.
The CII, however, also cautioned that it was important to safeguard the macro fundamentals to ensure India did not suffer significant rating downgrades and a potential flight of capital. “Since we are not going to see the end of the crisis soon, the government should not spend all its firepower at once,” the CII said.
For lifting the lockdown, the industry body has pitched for a “re-start calendar” across cities and States, based on a dashboard that can monitor curves of various key cities and States. In phase 1, it said sectors where work-from-home is difficult and which provide mass employment could be re-started to protect low-wage employment. They include manufacturing and transport.
In phase 2, which could start 2-3 weeks after phase 1, other sectors could be allowed to start. “The ramp up could be 50% employees to start with, for about three weeks. This could be increased gradually, based on how the curves are progressing in various cities and States.” 
Truck drivers and migrant workers willing to come back should be facilitated, dhabas on highways petrol/diesel stations and repair shops on highways should be opened, it said, adding logistics service providers must extend insurance cover of about ₹10-15 lakh for a period of three months to the workers and their families. 
To get back migrant workers, the CII suggested a COVID-19 insurance scheme for three months for which part cost could be borne by the government and part by the industry, besides an aggressive ‘messaging’ campaign.
On the economic front, the CII said it expects GDP growth for the current fiscal to be no more than about 2% with a downward bias. 
“India should brace itself for what may be a long haul to overcome the public health crisis and the economic crisis precipitated by the corona pandemic,” the industry body said.
 On relief for businesses, the CII said rather than the government giving direct subsidies to industry, enterprises should be supported through banks via enhanced credit limits for working capital, additional working capital limits — equivalent to April-June wage bill of the borrowers, backed by a government guarantee at 4-5% with a refinance guarantee from the RBI. Additional reconstruction term loans can be given to MSMEs and stressed sectors.
“Our estimates are the economy would need a credit expansion of 14-15%. Therefore, we would request the RBI to extend support to the industry,” it said. There is also a need to pre-empt failure in the banking sector, it said.
While the steps announced by the RBI Governor on March 27, adequately addresses the potential liquidity issues that will arise in the system, it is eminently possible that the pain would soon manifest in terms of capital and solvency in the system.”
Stating the economy cannot afford a bank collapse, the CII proposed the government set up a fund of ₹30,000 crore “that could be used by banks that meet certain criteria and under specified conditions.”",business

‘Tales from the Loop’ review: A beautifully-shot poetic puzzle

On the surface, Amazon Prime’s latest offering Tales from the Loop, a science fiction drama, appears to be more fodder for that sort of indulgence. But a couple of episodes into the show, you realise there isn’t much happening in terms of twists and turns, nor are our questions being answered, let alone addressed. There is silence, lots of silence. If you had to look out of your phones only for big reveals, there won’t be much left. But there is captivating imagery to savour and visceral emotions to feel.







“Over the years, we expect a mystery or a puzzle to solve, in terms of questions and answers, versus having an emotional experience that might transcend words,” says Nathaniel Halpern, creator, writer and showrunner of Tales from the Loop, over a long-distance phone call from the US.
When he set out to adapt Swedish artist, Simon Stålenhag’s wildly successful crowd-funded pictorial book with the same name, he was clear that he wanted to tell an emotional story in the sci-fi genre. Drawing inspiration from Rod Serling’s anthology television series The Twilight Zone (1959), Halpern wanted to make a show with a lot of humanity in it.
“In his work, Rod would be critiquing the society but there was also belief in humanity,” observes Halpern. It didn’t take much convincing to get the show green-lit as both Amazon Studios and Fox 21 Television Studios were keen on the idea of an immersive world-building, where sentiments and visuals take precedence. “Certainly it might take adjustment for an audience,” shares Halpern. “My hope is that you get two-three episodes in and realise that the enigmatic quality of the show is like a painting. A painting is not about answers but it’s about feeling.”
Featuring an anthology of eight episodes, the series is a unique adaptation. Stålenhag’s sensorial book contains original paintings, depicting the collusion of a bucolic life in Sweden with technological mysteries and experiments. Each episode in the show is inspired by a painting in the book. “There is really no road map for that kind of a thing,” reveals Halpern. So the process was largely dependent on reacting, emotionally and creatively, to the artworks, and taking cues from Stålenhag’s paintings to build settings and characters. “I’m very much a visual thinker and it’s a visual medium so you should give the audience something worth looking at,” he reasons.







Being as faithful as possible to the book, Halpern often consulted Stålenhag through the creative process. “I would ask him what would this look like. For instance, the character with the bionic arm, what would he look like in this world?” recalls Halpern.
In Stålenhag’s book, a world emerges where rusty robots and sinister artefacts are strewn in deep woods and empty landscapes, and technological experiments indicate larger philosophical occurrences. Halpern’s adaptation has the usage of peculiar brutalist architecture, which reminds you of the forgotten socialist structures in Bratislava, where the oddity of the buildings stands out, yet strangely blends in. “Certainly we were taking our cues from Simon’s work and early on when I was talking with Mark Romanek, the director of the pilot, we certainly did talk about brutalist architecture and the retrofuturism of it. It feels like both the past and the future, simultaneously. There is something unique about brutalist architecture.”
The coexistence of the past, present and future in the same space is not limited to the look of the show alone, but extends into time. The characters experience time not in a linear fashion, as we know it, but time that loops and doubles back, sometimes never to return. “Time is something I certainly think about a great deal,” reflects Halpern. “Film and television are unique media to explore time because you are creating this artificial time that theatre can’t do.”
In many ways, time seems to come to grinding at the moment, as humanity grapples with an unprecedented modern-day pandemic. “Perhaps people are more self-reflective right now, so they can reflect on time,” says Halpern, who hopes the show’s soothing nature helps the audience calm down and introspect. “I hope it provides some solidarity and comfort to the audience,” he adds. Currently waiting to know whether the show will be renewed for a second season, he is compelled to think what would the audience want at the other side of the pandemic. Once all the binging is done, what would people crave?",movies

Seema Sonik Alimchand’s biography of Rajendra Kumar focuses on the man behind the ‘jubilee star’,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/seema-sonik-alimchands-biography-of-rajendra-kumar-titled-jubilee-kumar-looks-at-the-late-actors-life-and-times/article31289284.ece,"The late actor Rajendra Kumar, fondly referred to as ‘Jubilee Kumar’, starred in a number of Hindi films that were silver jubilee hits in the 1960s — Dil Ek Mandir, Ayee Milan Ki Bela, Arzoo and Sangam, among others. He considered his sea-facing bungalow in the then Bombay as his lucky charm. But the actor willingly sold it in 1969 to Rajesh Khanna, when the latter requested him. In Seema Sonik Alimchand’s biography Jubilee Kumar (published by Hachette India) the author describes how Rajesh Khanna’s fortunes took a turn for the better, while Rajendra Kumar’s own stardom was on the wane in the following years. The book traces Rajendra Kumar’s early years after Partition, when he moved from Sialkot to Bombay, his initial struggles before he became an actor, his rise to stardom, friends in cinema and personal life. Edited excerpts from an e-mail interview with the author:
 
 Of the superstars (especially romantic), in Indian films, Dilip Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Shah Rukh Khan, it was Rajendra Kumar who had an additional title — the ‘Jubilee Star’. Yet, little is known about his life journey and his immense stardom is less acknowledged. When Rajendra Kumar’s daughter Dimple Patel invited me to write her father’s biography, I searched and found the gleam of a story within the simplicity of his life journey. RK’s struggle to get a foothold in the film industry became of prime importance. His resilience, readiness to work, gratitude, stardom, knack of recognising winners and his playing to the audience as the good son, good husband, the good doctor made for an inspiring biography. The music/songs of his films were reminiscent of the golden era of Hindi films. 







The most important interviews were with the family. I chatted for hours with RK’s wife Shukla Kumar and she was very forthcoming. A strong lady with strong ideas, she spoke no holds barred, as did the children, Kumar Gaurav, Dimple and Kaajal. I got some fantastic information about RK’s days before marriage to Shuklaji, from his brother Virendra Tuli. People in the film industry too spoke about him with great respect.

There were a series of videos (about 10 hours) recorded by Dimple during his last years, in which he himself related his life’s stories. 
It was like talking to him personally; his expressions and body language helped me read between the lines. Being a film buff since childhood, I had watched most of his films, and when I listened to the tapes, I could understand the person behind the star.THE international linkNobel Laureate Bertrand Russell appears in a cameo in Aman (1967) and the book describes how Rajendra Kumar took a chance and wrote to Russell, who reciprocated warmly. Aman also featured ghazal exponent Jagjit Singh as an actor, and the film marked the début of Naseeruddin Shah as a junior artiste.Seema Sonik Alimchand produced the album 100 Years of Hindi Film Music and has earlier authored The Warrior Within and Deedara aka Dara Singh, on Rajinikanth and Dara Singh respectively.
With interviews done, and after getting the facts from RK himself through his recordings, I wove a story. I had to play with words so as to not spoon-feed, revealing the truths but not having anything defamatory. When it’s a life story, it must be humane, with the ups, downs, strengths and weaknesses. Then the reader connects. The family was concerned about not hurting the sentiments of their old-time and current film friends. 
Rajendra Kumar and Raj Kapoor’s friendship surprised me. I hadn’t known about it, and also the camaraderie they shared... the Sangam incident when Rajendraji asked to speak [his own lines] after the song picturisation of ‘Dost Dost Na Raha’ and Rajji agreed, and retained the dialogue in the film. 
 The other revelation was how RK had helped so many actors and directors, his love for his family and his business acumen. 
After struggling to achieve, then fighting for a position; after the highs of fame, money and the good life, it was the climactic decline that made the story even more interesting. Yes, it is the law of nature, but to grasp and storify the circumstances, the introspection, inner stability, the support system and the bouncing back as RK did, was truly gratifying for me to recognise, write and later read again.",movies

There’s a plethora of cricket documentaries on various streaming platforms to help kill the boredom at home. In our list — drawn out in no particular order — there’s plenty of Caribbean flair, IPL action and rare behind-the-scenes footage of various dressing rooms.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians






Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians
 






Streaming on: Netflix
Starved of IPL action? This eight-part Netflix series, released last year, follows the fortunes of the IPL’s most successful and wealthiest franchise, Mumbai Indians, during their 2018 season. Starting from the auction that preceded it, a television crew is given a rare pass to the dressing room of the then defending champions. As you relive the tournament, you get to ride the emotions of the players and fans during an unusually difficult season. Watch the players grapple with issues of form, expectations from fans, media commitments and more. What stands out is the snippets of players re-visiting their homes and grounds where they fell in love with the game.
Branded a Rebel
Streaming on: YouTube
The most political documentary in this list. In the midst of their two-decade long sporting isolation due to apartheid, South Africa secretly held talks in the early 1980s with the world’s top cricketers to play a series of unofficial games in the country, known as “Rebel Tours”. With the world vehemently opposed to the brutal apartheid regime, it was always a tough call for cricketers to tour there. “Branded a Rebel” focuses on the most controversial of those tours, by the West Indies players in 1983.
The money was tempting, but while many of their top stars declined, those who took the bait were made to regret their decision till this day. “Mercenaries” at home, “honorary whites” in another country, the West Indies players who made the trip, including Colin Croft, Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran, returned home to lifetime bans by the West Indies cricket board. Many of the players, like David Murray, succumbed to a life of drugs and isolation.
The Test: A new era for Australia’s Team






Still from ‘The Test’
 






Streaming on: Amazon Prime Video
This newly released eight-part documentary follows the Australian men’s team over 18 months following the Sandpapergate controversy in 2018 that led to bans for two of their best batsmen Steve Smith and David Warner, and the team’s reputation in tatters. A film crew gets unprecedented access to an Australian dressing room that reveals vulnerabilities and extreme moods of the players and coaches as they pull on through a difficult period. Head coach Justin Langer gets generous airtime as he talks us through the team’s image rebuilding exercise. The producers got the script they wanted, with Australia retaining The 2019 Ashes and winning (back) some admirers along the way.

‘The Test’ review: Amazon Prime docu-series is all about the Australian cricket team’s path to redemption

Crossing the Line
Streaming on: YouTube
Now let’s rewind to what really happened during Sandpapergate. “Crossing the Line” is a one episode documentary on Australia’s Test tour of South Africa in 2017-18, arguably one of the ugliest series in recent memory for its controversies. Before even getting to the ball-tampering scandal, we had the staircase altercation between David Warner and Quinton de Kock, Kagiso Rabada shoulder barging Steve Smith, Warner’s mouthy send off to AB de Villiers, and more. When the host broadcasters caught the Australians using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball, the muck had hit the fan. The documentary, though interviews with leading commentators, focuses on the Australian team’s toxic culture, and their win-at-all-costs approach that cost them dear.
Lara

Streaming on: YouTube
Brian Lara’s 1994 began with his car being stolen in his native Trinidad, and ended with him breaking the world records for the highest Test score (375), highest first-class score (501) and with the world wanting a piece of him (small mercy that selfies didn’t exist then). This one-part British production follows Lara’s movements from the home series against England in 1994 where he broke the Test record, his prolific county season with Warwickshire where he scored centuries for fun, and also when the going wasn’t as much fun with whirlwind media commitments, endorsements, other commercial obligations and the hectic traveling. The crew also visits his village near Santa Cruz and a coaching stint with underprivileged black kids in Soweto shortly after apartheid was lifted in South Africa.

Streaming on: YouTube
From pitch vandalism to snakes, the Pakistan team had all sorts of security threats thrown at them when they arrived in India in 1999, for their first Test tour of the country since 1987.This one-part documentary goes behind the scenes of the thrilling two-Test series, starting with the cliffhanger in Chennai, remembered for Pakistan’s jailbreak, followed by a standing ovation. Only a foreign film crew could have waded through the hair-splitting bureaucracy to get access to the visitors’ dressing room and private parties. This series, unlike previous tours, was anything but dull and nor is this documentary.
Fire in Babylon
Streaming on: YouTube
Here we go again. Another one on West Indies? It’s because they were just so bloody good at one time. If you are the type always looking back wistfully at the time they were world beaters, this feel-good documentary is for you. Fire in Babylon begins as a socio-political history of West Indies cricket, set against the backdrop of black oppression in the 1970s. After a horrific tour of Australia in 1975-76 - the racial abuse from the crowds adding insults to several injuries – Clive Lloyd scouts the islands for the most terrifying fast bowlers and for 15 years, West Indies never lose a Test series. Several West Indian legends talk us through what made them near invincible for close to 20 years, and answer the uncomfortable question whether their intimidatory tactics fell within the spirit of the game.

This BBC one-part show goes behind the cult of Ian Botham, with the focus on his single-handed control over the 1981 Ashes series at home. In less than five years since his debut for England, Botham’s career had come a full circle. Captaincy was a nightmare for him and when his form slumped, he was relieved of the leadership midway through the 1981 series. That launched the beginning of “Botham’s Ashes” with his Headingley miracle, he was the toast of England all over again. Celebrities and politicians feature here, including John Major, Elton John, Mick Jagger, Stephen Fry. The programme also goes behind the scenes on how his stardom got to him, put a strain on his family and how he gave back to society with his fund-raising walks towards leukaemia research.

Cricket in the 80s: Rookies, Rebels, Renaissance
Streaming on: YouTube

Some of the best archival footage of cricket comes from that country so you can expect high standards from their documentaries too. Rookies, Rebels… follows Australian cricket’s most tumultuous decade, where they suffered their most prolonged form slump in history, due to the sudden exodus of greats like Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee to retirement and a host of fringe players to a Rebel Tour of South Africa, captained by Kim Hughes, for which they served bans. Captain Allan Border and coach Bob Simpson steer the young side through choppy waters and as the decade winds down, they lift the 1987 World Cup and thrash England 4-0 in the 1989 Ashes.",movies
Rakshit Shetty and Rishab Shetty to teach online filmmaking classes,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-avane-sriman-narayana-star-and-rishab-shetty-will-teach-the-nuances-of-filmmaking-online/article31288057.ece,"Being confined indoors has led to a boom in online activities and events. This is true of both commoners and celebrities. Rakshit Shetty has joined the bandwagon. Bengaluru-based The Big Little, founded by Kavya Shankaregowda and co-founded by Bharath Sudhama, curates and creates content online.
“Anybody can come up with great content, which fails to reach the target audience,” says Kavya. “That is where The Big Little comes in. We help curate the content and also make sure it reaches the potential target audience.” 
They are on a mission to create entertainment and content for people during the lockdown with a series called The Big Little Innovation, where they tie up with celebrities including Rakshit. The Avane Srimannarayana star will conduct a masterclass for The Big Little which is open to all.
Rakshit will discuss movies and behind-the-scenes activities with actor-director Rishab Shetty, The Seven Odds (Rakshit’s writing team), and Ajaneesh Lokanath (music composer), says Bharath. “People can post questions to Rakshit on his Instagram account. He will pick five questions, that will be answered in the masterclass.”
Rakshit is at home penning the script of his next project, Punyakoti. The actor takes time to speak to MetroPlus about films, his masterclass and the lockdown. Excerpts







Tell us about the masterclass...
I am not a master filmmaker. I am still learning. The idea behind the masterclass was to share whatever I have learnt. The Seven Odds and I want to interact with aspiring writers and filmmakers. We would like to show them the path we have trod and share our journey with them.
When will the masterclass be streamed?
The moment Big Little schedules it, we will go online. It will be an interactive class, we will take questions. Kavya will interact with people and choose five questions, which we will answer during the live session.
Is filmmaking an inborn talent or can it be learnt?
I believe it is a combination of both. To tell a story, there has to be a storyteller inside of you. You need to be passionate to tell a story and you also need to be clear why you want to tell it. Though not everyone can tell a story, it is a skill that one can improve upon with time and training. Some are organic in their storytelling pattern even though they have no clue about writing and vice versa. Any skill can enhance your talent. That way learning always helps, no matter what field.
How have you taken to the lock-down?
I look at it as a boon — maybe all writers look at it like that. As an actor, I have never got such a long break. I have been working non-stop for the last five to six years. The last story I wrote was Simple Aag Ondu Love Story, after which I haven’t had the time to write. Whatever I wrote — Kirik Party or ASN — was in collaboration with the Seven Odds.
Collaborative writing is also a reaction to Ulidavaru Khadante’s reception at the box office. I think it has made me feel that maybe a few of my choices may not work in the box office. I also wanted to build a team of writers where we share ideas. But now, I am just writing what I believe is my kind of a story.
How do you see the streaming platforms?
I am a very pro-online kind of a guy. When Ulidavaru.. was released, many people watched it on file-sharing sites. Had there been an online platform, the film would have reached many more and we too would have made some money out of it. I think people believe in my kind of films because of Ulidavarau... Both Kirik Party and ASN are on streaming platforms. I feel it is a good medium for us to make money and also reach a larger audience.
There are many online platforms, which many are not aware of. We gave the digital and satellite rights for Kirik Party, that boosted our marketing. The good thing about online platforms is that language is not a barrier, all that matters is if the film is good or bad.",movies

“I mean, I remember they wanted to do an opening for the Academy Awards that year that was sort of joking about it. And Heath refused. I was sort of at the time, ‘Oh, okay... whatever.’ I’m always like, ‘It’s all in good fun.’ And Heath said, ‘It’s not a joke to me — I don’t want to make any jokes about it’. That’s the thing I loved about Heath. He would never joke. Someone wanted to make a joke about the story or whatever, he was like, ‘No. This is about love. Like, that’s it, man.

 The film, which marks actor Daniel Craig’s last outing as British spy 007, was set to release this month but in the wake of the global pandemic, the makers decided to push it till November.
 Fukunaga, who came aboard as a director after the exit of Danny Boyle, was asked by a fan on Instagram about trimming and polishing the movie, given the extra time he now has before the film’s debut. 
In his reply, the director said the final cut of the film is great and there is no need to tinker with it.
“Some people have asked me this and although time would have been lovely, we had to put our pencils down when we finished our post production window, which was thankfully before COVID-19 shut down everything else,” Fukunaga said. 
“The short answer is money. Although Bond is a big movie, we still have to weigh cost with value. And like anything, you could tinker endlessly. The movie is great as it is, hope ya’ll will feel same too when it comes out,” he added.
No Time To Die, which is 25th installment of the action spy franchise, has been plagued by multiple problems since the start. Last year, Craig suffered an injury during the film’s shooting in Jamaica, for which he underwent a minor surgery in the ankle.",movies

He didn’t receive any cheers or whistles. But there were hundreds of comments that kept piling on, so fast that the young composer couldn’t even keep track.
The scene was unfolding on YouTube, where Anirudh was performing a live web concert to make Tuesday evening a little extra special for his fans. “I’m very happy doing something like this in such tough times and entertaining you all,” said Anirudh, who urged people to ‘stay home and be safe’ during this lockdown period due to the Coronavirus scare.
From his debut flick 3 (Moonu), to the upcoming Vijay-starrer Master, Anirudh took his internet audience on a musical journey, as he dished out hit numbers like ‘Why This Kolaveri Di’, ‘Oh Penne’, ‘Aaluma Doluma’, ‘Marana Mass’ and ‘Kutti Story’ from eight years in his career. 
All he had was a small keyboard (”I cannot recreate all songs completely here, sorry about that”) but once the composer took off, there was no stopping the ‘rockstar’, as he is popularly known in Kollywood. There was no set playlist that he had prior to the concert — he took requests from the comments and played them impromptu. 
The standouts from the concert was his vocal rendition of ‘Aathi’ (Kaththi) and the theme music of Kaththi and ‘Vaathi Coming’, which had him showcasing his exemplary keyboard playing skills. ‘Yennai Matrum Kadhale’ from Naanum Rowdy Taan was another highlight, for it saw ‘singer’ Anirudh reach the musical heights that Sid Sriram achieved in the song. The composer also ensured to keep his Telugu fans happy by dishing out two numbers from his debut Telugu film Agnyathavaasi and Jersey. The Vijay-starrer Master, which happens to be Anirudh’s latest release, got some special treatment as the composer entertained listeners by performing a few lines from all the songs.
The ‘Anirudh Live’ was a unique experience for fans of popular Kollywood music, for it took place minus the chorus, crowds, cheers and the near-perfect acoustics that you usually associate with such performances. Some lyrics were missed, and some notes might have been off, but for that two-plus hours, Anirudh’s music spread cheer to thousands of fans worldwide who are indoors due to the coronavirus scare.

Significantly, Mr. More has helped identify 25 to 30 daily wage earners in the village who are out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and helped provide them with rations. All this with the backing of Nabhangan Foundation, an NGO set up by actor Rajshri Deshpande, best known for her performance in the web series Sacred Games and the Malayalam film S Durga.
“Villages are majorly dependent on everyday jobs. Farming happens for about four months and the rest of the eight months, they join nearby factories as labour or travel to some metropolitan city,” she says. That has now come to a halt, turning the procurement of daily bread into a major struggle.
Her aim is to help Pimpalgaon Pandhari and other villages in every possible way. “The situation can get tricky in villages. If even one resident tests COVID-19 positive, it can get very difficult to handle things. Entire villages can get wiped out,” she says.
Ms. Deshpande had adopted Pimpalgaon Pandhari five years ago and has been working towards building the infrastructure of a primary school for children. With the last leg of work on the school building stopped in the wake of the lockdown, she has diverted the NGO’s mandate and corpus to the more immediate task: work for the COVID-19-afflicted people in rural and marginal communities, amongst daily wage earners and migrant labourers.
All this with just a handful of foot soldiers in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Pimpalgaon Pandhari, while she herself is stuck in Madakampoil in Kannur, Kerala, where she had gone for treatment before the lockdown came into force. Ms. Deshpande has been mobilising and procuring supplies though online transactions.
Besides Mr. More on the ground, there is Rushikesh Jaiswal who is supplying food and rations to the slum areas in Aurangabad. Vicky Shinde, a transgender activist in Worli Koliwada, has been distributing rations and medicines to the members of the community in Mumbai.
On Monday morning, when The Hindu called her, Ms. Deshpande was busy sourcing PPE kits for two hospitals in Jalna and one in Aurangabad, and also trying to ensure a reasonable supply of sanitisers and masks in the small village clinics in and around Aurangabad.
The idea behind Nabhangan Foundation has been to empower the villagers by involving them in community work and getting them a stake in the developmental projects meant for them.
The NGO is riding the model of community building, self-reliance and self-sufficiency to fight COVID-19 as well. “Motivating and managing social capital is the first and most difficult part of the process,” says Ms. Deshpande.
It is a gargantuan task, considering basic things like soap and water are luxuries in the villages. “They don’t even have enough water to drink. The awareness about washing hands is not there like it is in the cities. Washing hands once in the morning is what they know,” she says. Yet, they are willing to learn. For instance, the village women are keen on knowing how to make face masks.
For now, Ms. Deshpande’s focus is about not using money ad hoc, but channelising it in the best possible way, routing it to wherever the charity is needed the most. “We have been researching, planning and calculating what’s needed the most, where and how much. I am responsible for every single rupee and it should go in alleviating the problems of the most needy,” she says.
Once the lockdown is over, she intends to work on sustainable livelihood solutions for labourers and daily wage earners in the village. On April 10, she, along with a group of other members of various NGOs and charities, will fast for the day, in a Gandhian attempt to focus on the plight of labourers and daily wage earners. “The amount of food we have in a day can feed many of them over many days,” she says.",movies

 The Centre has decided to immediately release tax refunds to the tune of ₹18,000 crore, in a bid to provide relief to individual taxpayers as well as businesses struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown situation.
 On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry announced that all pending income-tax refunds up to ₹5 lakh would be released immediately by the Income Tax department. This would benefit about 14 lakh taxpayers, according to an official statement by the Ministry.
 All pending refunds for Goods and Services Tax and customs will also be issued, benefiting around one lakh business entities, including Medium and Small Enterprises. The total refund granted will be approximately ₹18,000 crore, the Finance Ministry said in the statement.",economy
Coronavirus | Government caps spending amid cash crunch,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/govt-caps-spending-amid-cash-crunch/article31292599.ece,"With the Centre expecting an extreme cash crunch due to the COVID-19 crisis, most Central government departments have been asked to cut their first quarter expenditure to 15-20% of the year’s budget estimates (BE).
Departments considered crucial to dealing with the pandemic and the resultant lockdown will not be affected by these restrictions, including Health, Pharma and Ayush, Agriculture, Rural Development and Textiles, Food and Consumer Affairs, as well as Civil Aviation and Railways. Transfers to States will also not be reduced.

However, several development sector Ministries including those dealing with education, tribal welfare, women and children, social justice and labour have been asked to restrict expenditure to 15% of BE.
“Existing guidelines for expenditure control have been reviewed. Keeping in view the present situation arising out of the COVID-19 and the consequential lockdown, it is expected that the cash position of government may be stressed in Q1 (April to June 2020). Considering this, it is essential to regulate the government expenditure and to fix the Quarterly Expenditure Plan (QEP) / Monthly Expenditure Plan (MEP) of specific Ministries/Departments,” said the circular issued by the Finance Ministry on Wednesday.
“Any deviation from this guideline would require prior approval from Ministry of Finance,” it added. Large expenditures are already subject to the expenditure control guidelines of August 2017 which says prior permission is required for any single payment above ₹5,000 crore.
The economic slowdown had already spurred the Finance Ministry to cap spending in the last quarter of 2019-20 (January-March 2020) to 25% of BE, from the earlier 33%.

The circular lists 17 key demands for grants and appropriations that will not be affected by the restrictions.
Apart from the key ministries related to health, agriculture and rural affairs, food and essential commodities and transport which were listed above, the Supreme Court and President can continue spending as usual. The Central Vigilance Commission and Union Public Service Commission also fall in this category.
Another 31 departments have been asked to restrict expenditure to 20% of BE, with 8% allowed in April and 6% each in May and June. This includes the Cabinet, the Houses of Parliament and Police. The Ministries of Home, External Affairs and some departments of Defence and Finance are also included in this category, as are transfers to union territories, including Delhi.

India’s GDP may plummet to multi-decade low of 1.6% in FY21: Goldman Sachs ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-gdp-may-plummet-to-multi-decade-low-of-16-in-fy21-goldman-sachs/article31288874.ece," Economic growth is likely to plummet to a multi-decade low of 1.6% in fiscal year 2020-21 due to COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing measures like lockdowns and social distancing, an American brokerage said on Wednesday in one of the bleakest forecasts on GDP yet.
 Indian policymakers have not been aggressive enough in their response till now to the crisis, and will need to eventually intensify their efforts, economists at Goldman Sachs said.
 It can be noted that growth was estimated to slide to a decadal low of 5% for FY20 even without the pandemic, and the virus outbreak has only worsened the woes.
 Many analysts have been doing downward reviews of their forecasts amid coronavirus concerns with some estimating a contraction in the first quarter of the fiscal, but this is the lowest forecast for the year as a whole yet.
“Despite the policy support so far, and our expectations of more, we believe that the nationwide shutdown, and rising public anxiety about the virus are likely to lead to a sharp deterioration in economic activity in March, and in the next quarter,” it said.
 The brokerage, which had forecasted the GDP to expand by 3.3% on a real basis in FY21 on March 22, said the 1.6% growth will be deeper than the commonly perceived recessions India has experienced in 1970s, 1980s and 2009.
 The growth slowdown is different from previous recession episodes because there is fear in the minds of citizens which were not present earlier, it said.
“Our sense so far is of a less aggressive policy stimulus by Indian policymakers compared to, for example, 2009,” it said, adding it hopes more actions will follow both from the RBI and the government on top of the 0.75 per cent rate cut and the stimulus package of ₹1.75 lakh crore that they have initiated, respectively.
“The fiscal math will be dented by only 0.08%, if we were to include the ₹1.75 lakh crore package,” it said, adding that States will also jump in with their fiscal packages.
 Consumption, which contributes 60% of the GDP, is set to be hit badly because of the lockdown, the brokerage said, upwardly reviewing the impacts on services consumption.
 It now expects 95% hit to recreation and culture, and hotels and restaurants sectors (up from 70-80% earlier) and education down by 80% (up from 60%).
“These effects obviously appear very high; in our growth forecasts, we assume these effects to be partial, given that the enforcement of even the nationwide lockdown is not complete, and we assume a staggering exit from the lockdown,” it noted.
 Apart from that, high frequency data is also not showing much hope, as auto sales were down sharply in March, besides, the fall in manufacturing purchasing managers index and muted global demands. ",economy
"Centre to release another ₹34,000 cr. GST compensation to States soon ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/centre-to-release-another-34000-cr-gst-compensation-to-states-soon/article31288565.ece,"
In a bid to provide further relief to States amid the coronavirus outbreak, the Finance ministry is planning to release another ₹34,000 crore to States as compensation for their revenue loss in the goods and services tax (GST) regime.
States, so far, have been paid pending dues till November and the remaining will be cleared in phases, sources said.
The Finance ministry cleared about ₹34,000 crore pending GST compensation for October and November in two tranches.
The first tranche of ₹19,950 crore was released on February 17, while the remaining amount of ₹14,103 crore was distributed to States and Union Territories on April 7, sources added.

In all, ₹34,053 crore was released at a time when States were facing liquidity crunch due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain spread of coronavirus.
According to sources, the government has released close to ₹1.35 lakh crore to States and Union Territories towards GST compensation cess.
Under GST law, States were guaranteed payment for any loss of revenue in the first five years of the GST implementation, which came into force on July 1, 2017.

The shortfall is calculated assuming a 14% annual growth in GST collections by States over the base year of 2015-16.
Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28% slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate States for any revenue loss.
The Centre has, so far, released about ₹2.45 lakh crore as GST compensation to States since the implementation of GST on July 1, 2017.
During July 2017-March 2018, ₹48,785 crore was released, while between April 2018-March 2019, ₹81,141 crore was paid to States. For April-May and June-July last year, ₹17,789 crore and ₹27,956 crore were released. Further, ₹35,298 crore was paid to States as compensation for August-September and ₹34,053 crore for October-November 2019.
GST collections in March slipped below the psychological ₹1-lakh crore mark for the first time in four months to ₹97,597 crore as the COVID-19 lockdown that shut most businesses compounded tax collections in an already sluggish economy.
GST mop-up in March recorded a 8.4% decline over March 2019 collection of ₹1.06 lakh crore. The collections were lower on account of dip in revenues from domestic transactions as well as imports.
In the last four months — November 2019-February 2020 — GST collection surpassed the ₹1-lakh crore mark. In February, mop-up was ₹1.05 lakh crore, January (₹1.10 lakh crore), December (₹1.03 lakh crore) and November (₹1.03 lakh crore).",economy

 Forex traders said rising Brent crude prices and a firm US currency also weighed on the local unit.
 At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened weak at 75.83 and lost further ground to settle at 76.34, registering a fall of 70 paise over its previous close. On Tuesday, the rupee had settled at 75.64 against the US dollar.
“Rupee continued its weak trend after some respite yesterday.

The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against the basket of six currencies was trading 0.25% up at 100.15.
 Trivedi of LKP Securities noted that the decline in rupee was largely due to “likely overseas outflows from local stocks amid oil importers buying and a strong greenback”.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital markets, as they bought shares worth ₹741.77 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data.

“Rupee fell in the latter half of the session as domestic equities came under pressure and ahead of inflation and IIP number.
“Expectation of weaker number could continue to weigh on the overall market sentiment. Also, surge in coronavirus cases reported in India is putting pressure on the currency.

"No press, no family: Space crew set for launch during pandemic ",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/no-press-no-family-space-crew-set-for-launch-during-pandemic/article31288803.ece," A three-man space crew finished preparations on Wednesday for a mission to the International Space Station (ISS), which is going ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic.
 Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of Russia’s Roscosmos space agency and NASA’s Chris Cassidy will blast off from Kazakhstan for a six-month mission at 08:05 GMT (1:35 pm IST) on Thursday.
 But with journalists and relatives unable to travel to Baikonur due to restrictions related to COVID-19, the traditional farewell press conference broadcast by Roscosmos had a more distant and sombre feel.
“Instead of talking only to some cameras we would be talking to some people right now,” said Mr. Cassidy, who is readying for his third stint in space.
Also read: India to have its own space station: ISRO
Mr. Cassidy, 50, admitted that the crew was “affected” by their families not being able to be in Baikonur for their blastoff to the ISS.
“But we understand that the whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.” Quarantine and isolation from the rest of the world are not new habits for astronauts.
 The glass barrier that separates them from media and loved ones during regular pre-launch events is specifically meant to protect them from potential infection.
 This time, however, their isolation has been “even more thorough”, said Mr. Ivanishin, after the crew opted out of visits to sites in Moscow during their training an hour outside the city.
 Thursday’s launch will be the first time a manned mission uses a Soyuz-2.1a booster to reach orbit, after Roscosmos stopped using the Soyuz-FG rocket last year.
 The newer boosters have been used in unmanned launches since 2004.
 The upgraded rocket relies on a digital flight control system rather than the analogue equipment used in prior Soyuz models.
 Mr. Ivanishin said the new system would be more independent and require less manual input from the crew in the event of emergencies.

The robot was funded by the Go Sports Foundation and with help from Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu which took care of the import duty and customs clearance.
The speciality of the robot, according to Sathiyan, is that it can give the ball at different speeds, trajectory, frequency and spin. 
“Of course, the imported robot can never replace a human. It gives one shot for a backhand and another for a long forehand whereas a normal robot will put the ball only at the same speed.

"Boxing, drawing, sewing keep Simranjit Kaur occupied",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/boxing-drawing-sewing-keep-simranjit-occupied/article31300587.ece,"Olympics qualified boxer Simranjit Kaur is making the best use of the lockdown by training with her brothers, who are also boxers, and pursuing hobbies like drawing and sewing.
Simranjit is fortunate that her brothers — Kamalpreet Singh and Arshdeep Singh (the current National silver medallist in 81kg) — are also boxers, who spar with her at home in Chakar village of Ludhiana district in Punjab during her daily training. 
“Since I don’t stay at home for long periods, I never really had such an opportunity. My brothers’ familiarity with boxing is an advantage. Both of them are helping me with padding,” Simranjit told The Hindu.
The 24-year-old is incorporating the inputs received from National coaches through video conferencing to fine-tune her game.
Simranjit, who won a 64kg World championships bronze in Delhi in 2018, had lost the 60kg trials for 2019 Worlds to the seasoned Sarita Devi. However, she improved her game to beat Sarita in the Olympic qualifier trial and secured a quota place by claiming a silver in the Asia/ Oceania qualifying event in Amman.
“I kept my focus on winning the trial for the Olympic qualifier. I didn’t have to bother much about my new weight as my natural weight stayed around 60kg. I had some solid punches, but I had to make some technical changes.
“I have been in touch with B.I. Fernandez (former India’s foreign coach). Whenever I find time I go to his centre in Mohali. He sends me videos and tells me to try out different techniques,” said the boxer backed by Lakshya Sports.
 According to National coach Mohammed Ali Qamar, Simranjit has immense potential. “She is an attacking boxer who can fluster the best of opponents with her punches. Only, she has to work on some technical and tactical aspects,” said Qamar.
Simranjit, who gave a power-packed performance to claim her maiden National title and bag the Best Boxer award in Haridwar in 2016, is happy to get some attention.
“People in my village knew about me after I got Asian and World championship medals. Following my Olympic qualification, more people recognise me.”
Amid expectations, Simranjit looks forward to the Olympics. “Good that we have one year to prepare. I am focusing on physical fitness. After the lockdown, we will focus on other areas.”
Simranjit keeps herself engaged with some creative work. “Drawing is one of my passions. I learnt it on my own. I had learnt sewing from my mother (Rajpal Kaur) when I was young. Since there is a lot of time in hand, I do some drawing and sewing,” she said.",other sports
Self-motivation is important: Ashwini,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/self-motivation-is-important-ashwini/article31295031.ece,"Like many sportspersons around the world, badminton player Ashwini Ponnappa is finding her way through uncertain times. 
The Tokyo Olympics has been postponed to 2021, there is little clarity over the new Olympic qualification period, and no one even knows when international sport will resume.
All that Ashwini — confined to her home here on account of the coronavirus-inflicted lockdown — can do is to stay fit and ready when the time comes to return to the court.
“This is the most important period for us. We have to stay motivated to train and do our exercises. There are days when you don’t feel like doing anything. You don’t even know what day of the week it is. In this situation, self-motivation is important,” Ashwini, a Red Bull athlete, said.
It helps that national coach P. Gopi Chand, Ashwini and other India international shuttlers are part of a WhatsApp group. “Gopi sir motivates us through our group. He gives us exercises, and he conducts group classes,” Ashwini, who partners Sikki Reddy in women’s doubles, said.
While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has set 29 June 2021 as a general Olympic qualification period deadline, it is up to the individual sports federations like the Badminton World Federation (BWF) to take their own final decision. 
“It is confusing. It would be nice to know the qualification criteria. That being said, clarity cannot emerge until the coronavirus outbreak subsides and things return to normal. Until then, you have to train and be ready to get back on court,” Ashwini said.
“Ideally, the BWF should extend the qualification period by how many ever months have been lost. In fact, the more time given the better. But if the cut-off is set at the 2020 All England Open (which concluded last month), that will be sad,” Ashwini said.",other sports

Gamers have a reason to be happy. Google is offering Stadia Pro for free for two months starting Wednesday.
“Keeping social distance is vital, but staying home for long periods can be difficult and feel isolating,” Phil Harrison, Vice President and GM, Google Stadia said in a statement. Video games are a great way to connect with friends and family when stuck at home, he added. “So, we’re giving gamers in 14 countries free access to Stadia Pro for two months.”
The free trial will be rolled out in the next two days.
Those signing up will get immediate access to nine games, including GRID, Destiny 2: The Collection and Thumper.
Apart from the games that are part of the free trial, gamers can buy more from the store. The store-purchased games will remain with the user even after the subscription ends.
The platform has adjusted its bandwidth usage by changing its default resolution to 1080p from 4K. This will reduce the load on internet.
Stadia lets gamers play across screens. They can use a Stadia controller and Google Chromecast Ultra to play on televisions. Alternatively, users can play on their PCs and laptops using keyboard and mouse.
For paid Stadia Pro subscribers, the platform won’t charge them for the next two months.
After the trial period ends, Stadia Pro subscription can continue at $9.99/month.
To get started, go to Stadia.com to sign up. The app is available on both Play Store and App Store.

Digital currencies adoption to be faster post COVID-19
Paper currencies had already been losing their importance after plastic money (like credit and debit card) and digital payment technologies were being increasingly adopted by consumers globally.
If people gravitated to new payment technologies due to convenience earlier, the COVID-19 crisis is pushing them to deal in digital currencies to reduce risk of virus transmission.
“The recognition of the infection risk will likely accelerate the push towards digital payment systems across the world,” Deutsche Bank’s Macro Strategist Marion Laboure tweeted.
According to a report in Southern Medical Journal, cited in a TIME article, 94% of the dollar bills tested have pathogens on them. Viruses and bacteria live on the surface for about 48 hours, and can potentially carry a live flu virus for up to 17 days.
That’s why China disinfected its banknotes in February to stop the spread of coronavirus.
In a press conference on February 15, the Chinese central bank revealed that commercial banks have been ordered to take used bills out of circulation and disinfect them.
The COVID-19 pandemic is making central banks across the world adopt digital currencies as many governments view handling cash as a potential risk.

Face ID recognition issue due to masked face
Biometric and facial recognition technologies have made us look into our phones to unlock them. It was cool and easy.
Now, that’s becoming a challenge as many countries are asking their citizens to wear face masks to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
The challenge is not just for iPhone users, but Samsung owners too.
The Face ID technology is meant to protect phone owners so that their mobiles can’t be accessed by anyone else.
The technology behind Face ID uses your eyes, nose and mouth features in combination to set up a lock. That means a face mask is going to cover two important features needed to unlock your phone.
To counter the challenge, some users have tried creating face masks that mimic their actual facial features, so their phones recognise them.
Others have tried to partially cover their face with a mask and create an alternative Face ID.
Both the ideas aren’t quite effective.
There are some simple workarounds. They won’t unlock your phone using your Face ID, but they will reduce the number of times you check 
your phone and use alternative ways to unlock it. These have been summed up by Wall Street Journal.
Firstly, make a paper list of things. For example, if you plan to visit the local store to buy a list of things, write or type it down, and print it out. This way, you won’t have to take your phone out frequently to unlock.
Secondly, wear a gloves and switch to inputting your passcode, instead of using Face ID.
Thirdly, if you are using a smart watch that can be linked to your mobile, use it to check for any notifications.

TikTok pledges $375 million to fight COVID-19
Short-video sharing app TikTok on Thursday pledged $375 million to support efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
“We are committed to playing our part in that global outpouring of mutual support and giving,” Alex Zhu, President, TikTok said in a statement.
The ByteDance-owned social media platform will give $250 million to support frontline medical works, educators and local communities affected by the COVID-19 crisis.
It will further give $100 million in ad credits to help business rebuild during these tough times.
Another $25 million is earmarked for organisations that deliver crucial public health information.
To help nurture education on its platform, the company will be giving $50 million in grants to educators, professional experts and not-for-profit organisations to make useful content accessible in a distance learning format.
On April 1, TikTok donated Rs 100 crore-worth medical equipment to India.
The company gave 4,00,000 hazmat medical protective suits and masks.
Apart from these medical gears, the company has also donated two lakh masks to Delhi and Maharashtra governments.
“Looking ahead, TikTok will be actively seeking more ways to contribute, including identifying the most effective ways to allocate these remaining funds to support ongoing relief needs,” Zhu added.

Phone calls are making a come back
As more people are staying indoors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, one old activity seems to be reviving, New York Times reported.
In the US, while major telecom players were preparing for a surge in internet usage, they didn’t anticipate a jump in voice calls.
For instance, Verizon handles its highest number of regular phone calls during Mother’s Day. It is one of the busiest call days for the operator.
But, the number of calls during this week has averaged 800 million, that’s double of the number of calls made during Mother’s Day.
Not just the number of calls, even the duration has seen an increase of 33% from an average day before the COVID-19 outbreak.
At AT&T, the number of mobile calls rose 35% post the coronavirus outbreak.",technology
From Rihanna to Baby Yoda: This cosplayer morphs into famous faces during lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/mumbai-cosplayer-goes-viral-for-her-lockdown-looks-as-rihanna-wonder-woman-money-heist-the-professor-geralt-of-rivia-the-witcher-baby-yoda-the-mandalorian/article31300109.ece,"Medha Srivastava is no stranger to headlines across the geekdom. Her cosplay as video game Dota 2’s Legion Commander for Comic Con India 2020, earned her the ‘Fan Favourite’ title from judges. Comic conventions aside, concept artist and illustrator Medha is one of millions of creatives trying to make the most of the lockdown. 
What is an artist to do in the current situation? Naturally, she decides to wow her 12,000-plus followers on Instagram with her surrealistic make-up and prosthetics skills, morphing into well-known figures, both fictional and real. So far, the 29-year-old has shared herself rendered as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher, Wonder Woman, The Professor from Netflix’s Money Heist, Baby Yoda from Disney+’s The Mandalorian, Rihanna and Billie Eilish, among others. In her posts, she also embodies the posture and mood of these figures.






Medha Srivastava as Billie Eilish
 






Cosplaying for three years now, Medha says she has long been into the performing arts, something nurtured by other women in her family. “I’ve never been into glamorous make-up, but as an artist, the whole idea of transforming yourself into another character, species or gender is exciting.”
For her portrayals as Rihanna and Billie Eilish, Medha used not only wigs and make-up but also coloured contact lenses. “I love powerful women like Rihanna who are really confident in themselves and change their approach to their craft regularly. I see that in myself,” she confesses. The Rihanna look was particularly popular for its red wig, reminding many of the singer’s ‘Only Girl’ days.
Make-up, prosthetics, wig-making and electronics all contribute to cosplay, but during the lockdown, Medha had to be careful with resources, especially for her portrayal as Baby Yoda. “We obviously won’t be out buying these tools, so I had to hunt around my house. I ended up using a sofa cover for the hood of Baby Yoda. And for the whole picture, I was kneeling down wrapped in this material to look really small. My mother thought I had made an installation!” Medha had done the look and shared the pictures of the final look before the launch of Disney+ in India — a look which won appreciation from friends and new followers alike.






Medha Srivastava’s looks as The Professor from ‘Money Heist’, Geralt of Rivia from ‘The Witcher’, and Wonder Woman
 






Over the past couple of weeks, her Instagram and Facebook accounts were flooded with video requests. So when the fourth season of Money Heist came out, she decided to take on the cunning yet quiet Professor. “Last year, I lost my grandmother, and kept her glasses in my bag as a memento. So when I decided to do a look of The Professor, I was hunting for glasses and came across these,” she recalls, “and, while the glasses were the correct shape and colour, they also made the look so special and personal to me. So I also did a time lapse video of the entire makeover.” 
The video is also a detailed one; she glues down her eyebrows to create new ones later. Then she contours a new facial structure using shadows and various brushes. A wig, artfully-placed facial hair, plus a shirt and tie had her viewers gush over the remarkable likeness.
As a creative who is under lockdown, creating these looks is not just a hobby or a way to pass the time, but also a way to keep in touch with potential employers with whom she can freelance as an artist, acknowledges Medha. “Cosplay makeup has also been so therapeutic in these anxious times and it offers a little escapism for me. The creativity does not need to stop.”",entertainment
Radhika Sarathkumar: ‘Acting is my first priority’ ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/radhika-sarathkumar-acting-is-my-first-priority/article31299765.ece,"Soap addicts became nostalgic when ‘Chitthi-2’ was announced. Radhika’s power-packed serial starring Sivakumar, Subhalekha Sudhakar and Yuvarani set a new trend in mega serials. Fans will have something new to cheer when the original also will be run on the same channel — Sun TV — soon. What does Radhika Sarathkumar think about this development? Concern for the welfare of technicians dominates the conversation with the queen of mega serials. 







Excerpts: 
Were you happy when ‘Chitthi’ was announced?
It was the channel’s decision. However, I was happy that ‘Chitthi’ was chosen for a second run. But I’m more concerned about the thousands of workers, artistes and technicians, who are involved in production. I really hope things reverse and work is resumed soon. 
Normally how many episodes do you keep in the bank?
 
Nearly two weeks of content, at any point in time. Plus, of course, unedited portions or some edited footage which can be put together in an emergency situation. But nobody expected this lockdown, which has brought everything to a standstill. This is beyond our control. 
 
About your pair in Chitthi2?
Sivakumar was my pair in the first part. He is a fantastic performer and delivered beautifully. 







Now it is Ponvannan. He has got into the character so well. You’ll know when the episodes are aired. 
 
After the lockdown, where will you head first — serial shooting or big screen?
 
Serial work, undoubtedly. ‘Chitthi’ has been stopped midway and I want the serial to start rolling. But nobody knows how things are going to pan out. Everyday, there is a new development. What we are in is a different and difficult situation. Serial needs a lot of planning and how much of planning can we do in these uncertain circumstances, I wonder. 
Next month, we will be seeing two versions of ‘Chitthi’ in different time slots of the day?
I do not have the answer for the question. Only the channel can reply.
Between producer (serials) and actor (big screen), which is your favourite?
 
I am happy to do what I know best — acting. From my first film Kizhakke Pogum Rail to Vaanam Kottatum, my latest film, I have acted in 350 films and 7,000 hours of serial content. In fact, I have worked in various departments of film making as well as television. All my serials have been runaway hits — ‘Chitthi,’ ‘Annamalai,’ ‘Selvi,’ ‘Arasi,’ ‘Vani Rani’ and so on. 







What next?
 
I often face this question. Acting for Radaan is something I will not give up. I give my hundred per cent, whatever the commitment. And that is the mantra of success. 
Ever thought about directing a film or serial?
 
I directed a tele-film, titled, “Siragugal” as the director was not in a position to continue for various reasons. I directed the serial, “Nalavathu Mudichu.” The point is, I am involved in acting round the clock — in films and also in serials. I do not have the time to direct either. And I’m devoted to Radaan, on which so many people depend. So I have to continue acting. This is a decision I have taken consciously. Direction is a huge responsibility, which demands wholehearted participation, in terms of time and energy. I’m not in a position to do that now. I have half-a-dozen films in the pipeline in Tamil and Telugu — ‘Marudhu,’ ‘Dhuruva Natchathiram,’ ‘Kurathi Attam,’ this is a film starring Atharva, and so on. Acting, therefore is my priority and direction can wait. Right now, I want ‘Chitthi-2’ to resume. I can’t think of anything else. ",entertainment
"Ramayan’s popularity proves its contemporary relevance, says 'Ram' Arun Govil",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ramayans-popularity-proves-its-contemporary-relevance-says-ram-arun-govil/article31298926.ece,"As the re-run of Ramanand Sagar’s ‘Ramayan’ on Doordarshan is breaking TRP records, Arun Govil, the Ram we all know, is elated. “It is a kind of nostalgia trip for me. Even some of the commercials that come in between belong to the time when it was first telecast on Doordarshan,” says Govil, after watching yet another episode with his family.

“Earlier, I used to analyse my performance but this time I am watching it for the love of the epic. Also, I am watching it with my grandchildren. My grandson, who is seven, asks about the background of various characters in the epic.”

Doordarshan highest-watched channel in India during week ended April 3: BARC 
Govil’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing since the re-telecast of the serial began. Many are communicating through email. “Some of them are colleagues and relatives who haven’t called in the past 20 years. I am constantly informed that the serial has garnered a record-breaking TRP rating. It proves that content and emotion can easily triumph over technique. Such TRPs can’t be earned without the youth watching it. I don’t think the massive viewership (170 million worldwide) is because of the lockdown as people still have plenty to choose from,” says Govil.







The actor feels it was Ramanand Sagar’s writing that helped in conveying the deeper meaning of the epic to the people. “His profound lines made my task easier. He ensured that complex issues are explained without losing out on the dramatic element. Those who watched it for drama and action in the 1980s, can now watch it to understand Ram’s view on relationships and worldly affairs,” he adds.
When the show was first aired, Govil’s divine smile won over the viewers. “It was my input. I started my career with Rajshri Films. Rajkumar Barjatya once told me, ‘Arun, your smile is special, use it when you get an opportunity.’ His words stayed with me. When the characterisation was being done everybody knew that I am a calm person but I wanted to lend something more that would bring out the divine qualities of Ram… something that would keep reminding the audience that he is an avatar without making it too obvious. It was then that I came up with this idea.”
It worked wonders in scenes where Ram had to be firm without losing his composure. “That’s art. For instance, in the scene where Ram explains to Bali why he was in the wrong. The smile never leaves his face even as he firmly puts his point across, making Bali repent,” he explains.
Looking back, Govil says, he bonded with everybody on the sets but was close to Sanjay Jog, who played Bharat. “Though he is no more, I cherish the time spent with him.” Govil is all praise for Arvind Trivedi, who played the role of Ravan. “When the counterpoint is strong, it lifts your performance. Coming from a theatre background, he proved to be a worthy antithesis to my style of performance.” Govil reveals that though Trivedi is very senior to him, he calls him ‘Prabhu’. “Recently, we exchanged Whatsapp messages where he kept addressing me as ‘Prabhu.’ Sometimes, it becomes embarrassing.” Govil says that he is also in touch with the technicians such as cinematographer Ajit Naik and sound recordist Rudra, who played important roles in bringing the vision alive but are hardly remembered.
The actor is irked by the way various political groups used the Ramayan and Ram for their vested interests. “That’s why I steered clear of politics despite several offers. It would have dented my Ram image,” avers Govil. 
Ram, he continues, existed in an age, when the word Hindu was not even coined. “There was only Sanatana dharma, which taught you the dos and don’ts in a life of discipline and values. How can somebody have a problem with the Ramayan?” he wonders. “When I am invited to give motivational talks, I often quote from the Ramayan as its episodes have contemporary relevance. For instance, the epic underlines the need to focus on the task at hand and teamwork. These two attributes are crucial to put an end to COVID 19,” he signs off.",entertainment

James Marsden didn’t expect the ‘X-Men’ films to be so popular ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/james-marsden-believes-the-comic-books-gave-a-solid-start-to-the-x-men-films/article31296224.ece,"‘X-Men’ alum James Marsden says while he always knew the team was creating something special, no one anticipated the franchise to exceed expectations of comic book fans.
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, X-Men are a team of fictional mutant superheroes appearing in American comic books. It was first published in 1963 by Marvel Comics.
 Marsden, who played Scott Summers/ Cyclops in four ‘X-Men’ films, believes the books gave a solid base to the filmmakers to start the series in the year 2000.
 “I think we all hoped it would become what it’s become, and we knew it had the power to with the legacy of the X-Men universe. They’ve been around since 1962-1963? And so when we first started, it was 40 years of backstory and superfans.
 “So we knew if we do this right, this could be something forever, for a long time. I’d hoped, but I did not anticipate that they’d still be making them. I mean, I thought maybe they’d make four or five of them in its success, but how many have they made now, 10? So it’s kinda crazy and really cool,” the actor told CinemaBlend.
 The 46-year-old actor, whose last appearance was a cameo in 2014’s ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’, is proud to be associated with the franchise.
 “Obviously I’m not a part of all of them, but you exist in that universe and it’s always something I’ve been really proud of. It was definitely the first time in my career I was like, ‘Now I’m part of something really special right now, and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity’,” he said.
 “It’s rare to know you’re part of something special while you’re shooting. Often you shoot it and it becomes some sort of a surprise success, like ‘The Notebook’ or something like that, where no one knew when you were filming it. But during the ‘X-Men’ movies, it was like, ‘Okay, this is something unique. This is something special’,” he added.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the ‘X-Men’ films.
The latest film under the franchise was last year’s ‘X-Men: Dark Phoenix’, fronted by Sophie Turner. Another in the works is the spin-off ‘The New Mutants’, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, among others. ",entertainment
"Tribute to Dadi Janki: Simply white, simply beautiful",https://www.thehindu.com/society/dadi-janki-simply-white-simply-beautiful/article31300486.ece,"Dancing is an exhilarating experience, enabling empowerment, education and enlightenment. As artistes, certain moments come by in our lives, evidently with blessings from Providence that open the doors to knowing ourselves better, not only though the art but also through awareness in every action. They are the cherishable few occasions that provide a life-time opportunity. We ought to grab, savour and recapitulate them. One such episode was the centenary celebrations of Dadi Janki, one of the most elevated spiritual world leaders and chief of Brahmakumaris — the largest movement led by women. 
The pristine purity of Madhuban at Mt. Abu seems like a dream, making one wonder whether this could be ‘Paradise on Earth.’ The campus is on its own, a self-sufficient kingdom but with no showmanship of any ruler, auxiliary attendant or staff. Every face we meet is happy, welcoming and non-fussy, which is seldom seen these days. The one and only Mantra for greeting, bidding, or beckoning is OM SHANTI. The protagonist, Dadi Janki, appeared in a wheelchair with an assistant and few other Sevaks, as we were taken to her chamber. It was out of habit that a few of us went ahead to touch the feet to which she smiled and said: “Here all are the same, please do not fall at my feet.” We were speechless, just to see her lustrous demeanour. Is she really a full one hundred years old? The bewitching child-like smile reminded one of BALA, the baby Goddess, before our eyes without any paraphernalia whatsoever. Simply white and simply beautiful, inside-out. A Goddess Saraswati, without any conspicuous tool. 
Full of grace
Dadi Janki was radiant, endowed with a celestial countenance, a picture of bountiful grace. If one’s subtle vibration can capture such aura, it is actually mind-blowing. Apparently, the organisation, which does not affiliate itself to any particular religion and the typical Guru-Sishya lineage, believes that each one is the Supreme ATMA personified. All the same, since there is a method of Raja Yoga taught and a unique way of living that becomes the charter, the importance of good teaching and guidance is maintained. As for the huge gathering of crowd, there were no formalities at the institution’s doorstep and no fee collected, much to our surprise. It seemed like home-coming for most people.
Dadiji became an avid listener too as she heard us, as the TV channel PEACE OF MIND of Godlywood studio took an interview. “Movements of animals, birds and forms in nature having been adapted in Yoga Asanas and the units of movement in dance incorporate many of these Asanas in a graceful and lyrical fashion. Muni Patanjali was inspired by the vision of the Lord of Chidambaram, Nataraja, and hence it is evident that Yoga is an indispensable ingredient in Natya.” Dadiji agreed thereafter that the eight limbs — Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Prathyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi — form an essential part of any Yoga Sadhana, including Raja Yoga and Natya Yoga. “Chittavritti Nirodha’ or control of thoughts and senses, is a must in Yoga as the body, breath and mind together move towards the soul. The withdrawal and peaceful relaxation go together. It was wonderful to become acquainted with the meditation taught by this organisation, coupled with adherence to discipline and good conduct, whereby one never disregards another soul. 






Dadi Janki delivers a speech at the Sardar Memorial Auditorium in Ahmedabad on February 13, 2011.

The meditation in the Raja Yoga that kindles the light in the point between the eyebrows (Ajna Chakra, or the third eye) focuses on the Supreme light/ SHIVBABA, God as Patita- pavana Paramatma. At the interview that she gave to media, there were a few significant sentences that come to memory: “Yoga is awareness, a Sadhana of human to divine consciousness. The modern system looks after just physical health, whereas the term Health, encompasses a complete mental, social, physical and spiritual well-being. Raja Yoga meditation changes the internal physiological response to environmental circumstances, thereby creating an adaptive and positive response. The power of the mind to resist disease is increased enormously as the subconscious level is healed and higher consciousness is awakened.”
The auditorium had a capacity of at least 10,000 spectators and was overflowing much before the events commenced. The performance by our team was on Shivdarshan and Srishti Chakra, an old composition on the principles, practice and aim of the world community of Brahmakumaris. It was heart filling to receive blessings from all the frontline Brothers and Sisters, led by Dadi Janki, both before and after the recital. At Dadi Janki’s much awaited speech on the occasion, she said, “At least, put an end to the crisis within your own mind when you can’t do much about the crisis outside of you. Flexibility means converting your problems into teachers. Never lose hope, never give up — if the task is given, you will also get the power to fulfil it. Light and Might are with you as your Right from God. You can bend only when you are strong. Be like the lotus, take what is useful but do not let the dirt spoil your beauty. Sorrow makes one sick and scared, so do not take it from anyone. If you allow the negative in word, thought or form to enter you, then it is due to your weakness. Always ask what you have to do at this moment in time and not past or future.”
A great soul chooses wise words, understands the value of words, uplifting, true, boosting our spirits. Only a powerful soul can afford to be humble and offer love.
Health is not merely a precious possession but a resource in which the entire community, nation and world has a stake. Being a birthright, it is one treasure which neither science nor wealth can buy. To gain this, one would readily give up everything. Here again, if we analyse, we perhaps covet some parts of ourselves more than the rest and if a stage comes when we got to choose between this body part and that, it is finally the breath or life force that we do not wish to give up! Meditation on the breath through Yoga as in dance does help.
Dadiji had a hand that never would hurt, a tongue that never would pierce and a mind that never would tremble or waver. A life of beautiful balance between head, heart and hand. A caring, sharing and inspiring figure. Om Shanti!",society
"Locked down, locked out and hungry: the plight of migrant workers in Visakhapatnam",https://www.thehindu.com/society/locked-down-locked-out-and-hungry-the-plight-of-migrant-workers-in-visakhapatnam/article31298415.ece,"Fear and anxiety have been Manasa Devi’s constant companions since lock down. Manasa Devi’s husband Murli Prasad is a daily-wager and they moved to Visakhapatnam from Uttar Pradesh along with their son in search of work over seven months ago. The family of three which runs on her husband’s earning live in a small room in Akkayapalem, one of the busiest localities in the Southern part of Visakhapatnam. The family is struggling to survive now. “We have been spending sleepless nights wondering about our finances. The landlord has been kind to us and allowed us to continue staying here without rent, but if the situation continues we are scared that we will soon have to vacate the place,” she says.
The only silver lining for Manasa Devi and her family has been the NGO Ken Foundation that has been providing food to them from the Shaadi Khana Shelther Home, from where the Foundation operates. But even that is not without its terrifying experience. Murli Prasad makes the harrowing 10-minute walk from their room to the Shaadi Khana Shelther Home, to get food. Says Manasa Devi, “I am scared every time he does that, wondering if he will come back home beaten up.” “He was beaten up once. But have no other option. We either risk our lives or we starve,” she says. 
But the Foundation continues on its mission to feed the helpless migrants. 
It was a tip-off from a shopkeeper in Akkayyapalem, that had the volunteers of Ken Foundation spring into action. They heard that over 200 migrant workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were stuck in the city and had no way of making ends meet. They understood how for the hundreds of migrant workers, who are thousands of miles away from their homes, the government’s guideline to stay indoors is a challenge. Most of them who depend on daily wages to survive are struggling, like Manasa Devi and her family.

Founder of Ken Foundation, Santosh Pulletykurty says the Foundation has taken on the challenge. “We did not want this to end up as another case of migrant workers walking miles to get back home. We read enough of that horrible struggle in the news. Most of them lived at construction sites where they worked as carpenters or masons. With the announcement of lockdown, they could neither stay at these sites nor travel back home. They were stranded struggling for food and shelter,” he says. 
The Foundation swung into action,got in touch with the officials of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation and took over the Shaadi Khana Shelter Home. Over 120 male labourers were accommodated here while 80 others, mostly women and children, were housed in another hall not too far. “We made two groups so that there was enough space for people to maintain a safe distance from each other. Beds are set three feet away from each other and our volunteers are doing their best to teach them social distancing. Government medical officers will soon be visiting the shelter to conduct tests on these workers,” says Santosh.
One of the labourers who live in this shelter is Rajiv Tiwari, from Basti, Uttar Pradesh. Rajiv says he has always been homeless in the city and has lived on the streets. He earned money as a daily wage painter, ate at roadside stalls and slept on pavements or the platforms of the railway station. After the lockdown, even those spaces became out of bounds for him. “Police shooed us away from everywhere. The small eateries that I frequented were closed and I starved for days,” he says. 
You can help At the shelter, all the residents are provided with meals thrice a day. To ensure proper hygiene, they are given soaps and napkins. The foundation posts updates on its Instagram handle @kenfoundation, to encourage people to get involved, “Several people have come forward to help us feed the workers. However, essential items like masks, toothpaste, toothbrush, soaps, and medicines are needed. We are trying to reach out to more people to help us with this,” says Santosh Pulletykurty, Founder of Ken Foundation. (You can reach out to Ken Foundation at 9885674949)
The 32-year-old daily labourer has a wife and an infant son back home waiting for him. “I just want to go home and be with my family. But I don't think that is possible even after the lockdown is over as I'll have to continue working to afford a trip home. The little bit of savings that I had was spent buying food during the first three or four days of lockdown, I have no money on me now.” 
Like Rajiv, there are over 100 workers from several parts of Uttar Pradesh stuck in Visakhapatnam who Ken Foundation is helping. Moti Lal, another daily wager from Gond, Uttar Pradesh who came to the city just 20 days ago has spent an entire week just looking for food. “I lived in a small room with four other labourers. As there was no facility to cook and we mostly ate at roadside stalls. From the day lockdown was announced we had no way of feeding ourselves. Finally, we learned about this shelter home and moved here since there is food,” he says. 
The migrant labourers wait to find out what fate has in store for them next. Manasa Devi fervently hopes,“Once this is over, all we want is a little support from the government to go home and see our families.” ",society
Why this lady chose to be an auto driver,https://www.thehindu.com/society/my-auto-rani-and-i/article31298408.ece,"It was one of those typical mornings on Sarjapur Road when my usual travel app couldn’t land me a cab or an auto and I was left with no choice but to try my luck at the auto stand.
True to form, the usual suspects simply refused to entertain a ride into the city. I just kept trudging along the line, asking, “Anna, Infantry Road barthira? (Will you come to Infantry Road),” and honestly not expecting an answer in my favour. 
I had almost reached the end of the line, but kept with the question, looking up only when I realised the ‘Anna’ in question had toe rings and nail polish on her feet.
She said she’d take me and I gratefully hopped in. Apart from her kajal-lined eyes, I couldn’t see much of her face, swathed as it was in hijab-fashion against the dust. Or so I thought.
During that one-and-half-hour drive I realised her face gear didn’t have much to do with the pollution. People would just turn and stare unabashedly. Pillion riders would nudge the biker to take a look, occupants in cars would crane their necks for a better glimpse, truckers would do a double take and her fellow auto drivers were no exception either. Through it all, she looked straight ahead.
My initial amusement gave way to curiosity about her unusual career choice and I struck up a conversation with her. 
Hailing from Mysore, Ganga, 35, has been an auto driver for almost two years now. She is a single-mother and her 11-year-old son suffers from a heart condition. “In the beginning, I took up small jobs in offices, even working as a housemaid and cook at different times. But every time my son had to be hospitalised, it became difficult to keep asking for leave.”
“People were sympathetic, but lost patience when I had to take leave suddenly. That is when I realised if I was an auto driver, I could be my own boss with my own schedule. Now, I don’t cut a sorry figure with co-workers,” she says.
Truth be told, her family initially had saved up to buy an auto for her younger brother, but seeing her interest and efficiency, (she learnt to drive it in two days!) they handed it to her. 
Despite making heads turn on the roads, Ganga says it was pretty smooth sailing at the RTO, where all her paperwork was processed without a hitch. “Out on the road, I see all kinds of co-workers — those who graciously give me way and others who tell me to go back to the kitchen. That is one of the reasons I cover my face completely,” she says. 
Ganga hits the road at 9 every morning after dropping her son off at school, taking a two-hour break when he returns, before winding up at 9 every night. With the current lockdown in place, she is confined to her home with her son, who “thankfully, hasn’t had to go to the hospital for a while now.”",society
Beat lockdown blues with home birding,https://www.thehindu.com/society/beat-covid-19-blues-with-home-birding/article31298322.ece,"The bird just sat there for almost twenty minutes. It was perched on the topmost branch of a neem tree by my balcony. I expected it to fly off any moment, and had no hopes of identifying it — I am no expert birder. But it showed no signs of leaving. I drew up a stool and sat comfortably. It was a good distance away and I could make out what appeared to be a faint tan colour, and the size was that of a myna’s. Other than that, I had no idea of what it was.
It swivelled its tiny head, turned on its feet and sat facing west, exposing its belly to the setting sun. It glowed orange. What could the beauty be? I quickly got a photo taken on my mobile phone. I squinted into the receding light — I could not make out any more colours or features. Finally, it fluttered away. And all I was left with was a terrible photo and a patchy memory of its features.

I WhatsApp-ed the photo to a couple of birders. They quickly identified the little guy — it was a coppersmith barbet. One birder even told me that its call was a series of ‘tut-tut-tuts’. It was a lifer for me — in birding terms, the first time a person spots a particular bird.
Nothing like birding to get over COVID-19 blues. Chennai birders Munish Palaniappan, and K Gnanaskandan of Madras Naturalists Society, list birds such as myna, babbler, shikra, tailor bird, Asian koel, Rufous treepie, common tailorbird, golden oriole, white-throated kingfisher, black-rumped flameback woodpecker, white-browed wagtail, and red-vented bulbul among birds that can be seen from urban homes.

“I’ve been doing balcony birding from my home in Adambakkam and spotted the orange-headed ground thrush, large-billed leaf warbler, and brown-breasted flycatcher. I assume they are on passage migration — they are on their way back home to the Himalayas from Sri Lanka,” adds Gnanaskandan.
City-based Dharma Chandru, a sports and landscape photographer, has also been photographing birds from his balcony. He says that he is encouraging people to do so and stay indoors. “Photographing birds requires plenty of patience. You end up waiting for that one shot for hours,” he says. “And during the time, we tend to forget the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Uber bid to set up fund to help driver-partners,https://www.thehindu.com/business/uber-bid-to-set-up-fund-to-help-driver-partners/article31302528.ece,"Cab hailing service Uber on Thursday announced setting up of a new fund in partnership with two social enterprises — Give India and Samhita — to support its driver-partners. As the first step, Uber will be depositing ₹25 crore in the ‘Uber Care Driver Fund,’ following which small grant amounts will be transferred directly into the accounts of “thousands of driver-partners” every day to help them meet their immediate and essential family needs.
In addition, Uber aims to further raise funds through contributions from its employees, riders, CSR funds and citizens through a partnership with Milaap, a crowd-funding organisation, to take the total amount raised to ₹50 crore.
While Uber did not share the amount that will be transferred to each driver-partner, Pradeep Parameswaran, president, Uber India and South Asia, said their aim is to make sure the amount is sufficient to take care of the needs of a family of five for the next few weeks. Uber said it has started depositing grants into drivers’ accounts Thursday onwards.
Mr. Parameswaran said that with social distancing norms, their drivers have not been able to earn during the past few weeks. The drivers, he said, have also reached out to Uber seeking immediate cash support.
“Supporting driver communities has never been more important. We hope this first financial relief package for driver partners helps them and their families cover their immediate and urgent daily needs. In the coming days and weeks, we will first be fund-raising, and then providing driver-partners additional outright grants, from the Uber Care Driver Fund,” he said.
Over the next few days, Uber will also roll out a hospital cash insurance policy which will benefit driver-partners, and cover COVID-19 and other illnesses which require hospitalisation, for up to 14 days.
All donors, the company said, will be provided an 80G tax receipt to claim tax rebate according to applicable laws.",business
Rupee hits fresh low during intraday trade,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rupee-hits-fresh-low-during-intraday-trade/article31302514.ece,"The rupee hit a record low during intraday trade on Thursday, which prompted the central bank to intervene to help the currency to cut some losses.

Industrial output grows 4.5% in Feb.,https://www.thehindu.com/business/industrial-output-grows-45-in-feb/article31302511.ece,"India’s factory output accelerated 4.5% in February in comparison to the previous year. The growth in the Index of Industrial Production came on the back of higher output in mining, electricity and manufacturing sectors, according to the data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday.
The cumulative growth for the financial year so far, from April to February 2019-20, stands at 0.9%
February saw the second straight month of improved industrial output after a contraction in December. 
However, the IIP is likely to plunge drastically again for March, due to the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a halt in most business. The mining sector saw a robust 10% growth in production in February, while the electricity sector saw 8.1% growth in comparison to the previous year. Manufacturing sector output grew more cautiously, at a rate of 3.2%.
In terms of industries, 13 out of 23 groups in the manufacturing sector showed positive production growth in February.
 Industries manufacturing basic metals saw the highest output growth of more than 18%, while chemicals manufacturing saw production rise 8%. 
However, the auto sector saw a major slump in February, with the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers contracting 15.6%. Computer and electronics manufacturing output also saw negative growth of almost 15%.
Overall, capital goods contracted almost 10%, while consumer durables saw negative growth of 6.4%. However, primary goods saw output grow more than 7% and intermediate goods grew over 22%, the data showed. ",business

 COAI said in case Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the government still feel the need for extension of benefits to all prepaid feature phone subscribers, then this should be provided in the form of a subsidy to the telecom sector like many other essential services.

Net traffic rises by 30% post lockdown: COAI

 “This could be adequately compensated from the USO Fund where more than ₹51,500 crore is being lying unutilised as on March 31, 2020,” COAI said in a letter to TRAI.
 The industry association said that adequate measures have been taken by telecom operators to support low-income users, who genuinly need help to stay connected, despite the financial stress being faced by the sector. Expectation of extending benefit to all prepaid users, even those who have the means to recharge, is not appropriate, it said.
 Providing benefits indiscriminately even to privileged customers would amount to “unjustified subsidy” to a larger section “at a steep loss to industry”, it has argued.
 COAI also said that the value of benefits announced by telecom companies for low-income users, including extension of validity and talktime credit, is estimated to be over ₹600 crore, even on conservative basis.",business

When films become guidebooks to surviving a pandemic,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/when-films-become-guidebooks-to-surviving-a-pandemic/article31302053.ece,"The world may be paralysed, but time is not. The future is looking at us. This pandemic will be remembered. It will be mourned and storified. Its people will be studied, and its leaders scrutinised. But the fact is that nobody knows how to feel. These are unchartered waters. Reality today is infinitely stranger than fiction, but fiction is the only point of reference we have. Dystopian thrillers like I Am Legend and A Quiet Place are being rewatched. Steven Soderbergh’s Contagion and Aashiq Abu’s Virus are being rediscovered – but they are also being embraced as a default guidebook.
These films are comforting in how their imagery helps shape our perception of events beyond our doors. For instance, the severity of the disease evokes the deadly symptoms and sterilised grimness of Contagion in my head. The administrative efforts to contain the spread evoke shots of the health minister (Revathi) and her team systematically chasing the sources of Kerala’s Nipah outbreak in Virus. The 21-day curfew evokes the deserted streets of Kozhikode, the hazmat suits of ambulance drivers and medical workers. Even the anxiety of staying isolated – and resisting the urge to reach loved ones – evokes the story of young Dr. Abid Rahman (Sreenath Bhasi) withering in guilt after sensing that he may be the carrier that infected Dr. Sara Yakub (Madonna Sebastian), his girlfriend and fellow resident.
For better or worse, cinema is the only prism through which we visualise the gravity of an unprecedented situation. It’s the only way some of us can approximate – and process – the fear, paranoia and damning singularity of a total lockdown. It’s the easiest answer to the toughest questions – Where To Go (nowhere) and What To Do (nothing) – in the syllabus of survival. But each one of us is reading these questions differently.
I associate this slow-burning sense of doom with an unlikely movie from my childhood. M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs is technically a sci-fi horror picture about an American family isolated on a corn farm during an alien invasion. But the magnitude of a moment dawning upon humankind has rarely been captured as eerily. It takes ages for the Hess family – single father Graham (Mel Gibson), his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and his two kids – to realise that the starkness of uncertainty has snuck up on the snark of modern civilization. They can’t see the enemy coming. Instead, they obsess with news channels that inform their is-this-really-happening arrogance. With the danger at their doorstep, the two men bolt the windows shut with wooden planks, restricting movement and hoping against hope to survive the inevitable attack. Their two-storied farmhouse in the middle of nowhere is emblematic of the primal loneliness that has kicked in during this coronavirus pandemic.
I’m not sure why it’s only Signs that I think of. The mind reacts strangely when cornered by the unknown. Maybe it’s the unsettling scenery in front of my apartment – a barren field. You can almost see the breeze. The Signs theme rings in my head when I step out to go “hunting” for groceries. When I feel an itch in my throat, I hear the dog’s barking extinguished by the extraterrestrial shadows closing in. One scene in particular haunts me: Graham decides to cook everyone their favourite dish. Despite the feast at the dinner table, he snaps at his frightened children. Is this our Last Supper? The stress – and looming failure – of keeping his family safe briefly breaks him. Some days ago, as I spoke to my (stubborn) father who lives alone in another city, my voice cracked. Fleetingly, the frustration of being unable to shield my family had punctured me. At that moment, I thought of chicken teriyaki and french toast, two of the dishes Graham cooked that night.
Maybe I also think of Signs because it is a film about faith. Graham is an episcopal priest who quits the church after a personal tragedy. It takes nothing less than the proverbial end-of-days scenario – a twist of fate – to restore his faith in God. At some level, a part of me believed that this world was so broken that it would take an unmitigated disaster to trigger the dormant humanity in us. Long-lost friends would reconnect. We would live and suffer and grieve as one people. But a part of me now knows that this world view reeks of social privilege. By virtue of having to end, a movie is obligated to tell us that a crisis always has a silver lining – perspectives are rebooted, cities rebuilt and lessons learned. 
Fiction has no patience for the ones who have no doors to shut. But life, like time, is saddled with the burden of moving forward – the poor and homeless devoured by aliens on panicked streets, with a revamped Graham preaching prayer to desperate survivors. Reality is a cumulative truth. One narrative exists only at the cost of another. The signs are clear: Ordinariness will become the aspiration, and recovery, the new currency of living. History has been made, but it is also being rewritten.",movies
Pride and prestige: Remembering ‘Vietnam Veedu’ on its 50th anniversary,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/50-years-of-vietnam-veedu-a-look-back/article31300374.ece,"“Isn’t slumbering a kind of rehearsal for death, in this drama called life, Savithri? I’ve had my rehearsal long back and am waiting for my time.”
These were not the last words of a dying man, but of a man who had lost his “position” and “possession”, and become a burden to his family in the wake of his retirement. The ‘prestige’ that he held dear to his chest had been lost, as was “justice”. The words, spoken by a devastated Prestige Padmanabhan in the now-classic Vietnam Veedu, echoed the emotions of a generation of (wo)men who were in the last act — the phase post-retirement when your relevance is taken for granted.
That absolute feeling of helplessness one has to pay as a price post-retirement, was what writer Sundaram dabbled with in Vietnam Veedu — perhaps one of the earliest movies to delve deeper into the vulnerabilities of a man, who wakes up one day to realise that he is now a senior citizen. In other words, Vietnam Veedu was both melodrama and a miserable reflection of society.
Witnessing Sivaji Ganesan’s live performance as a teenager when Vietnam Veedu was a stage play to reprising the role in the later stage of his career, it has been a long journey for actor and playwright YG Mahendran. “I’ve admired Sivaji Ganesan ever since he staged Veerapandiya Kattabomman,” says YGM, when I call him up for a quick chat about Vietnam Veedu, which, he says, was supposed to have re-released on March 27. Excerpts from the interview:
I watched the play when I was doing my PUC (Pre University Course). It was a massive success. In fact, there were long queues outside Annamalai Mandram. I have vivid recollections of the experience because I remember watching it with two other stalwarts, producer SS Vasan and Hindi actor Rajendra Kumar. Of course, I have not just been a Sivaji Ganesan fan but a fanatic.
Usually, Sivaji leaves the theatre as soon as the play gets over. But that day, he stayed back to receive Vasan and Rajendra Kumar. The funny part is, he was consoling both of them who were left misty-eyed. The play took a toll on Vasan personally because the portrait of Padmanabhan’s [Sivaji Ganesan] mother was actually Vasan’s mother.
That is an interesting episode because Sundaram is a product of UAA and he first brought the subject to my father. But for some reason he was not too impressed by it. That could have been the best thing that happened to Vietnam Veedu. Because it went to the King [Sivaji Ganesan]. Sundaram later pitched it to Sivaji, who found something totally different in his character. He had not done such a role till that point. In fact, my father used to say that Sundaram should be grateful to him for rejecting it.
The reaction was ecstatic in those days. There was absolute silence in the hall, especially in the climax. By the time it reached the final act, we were all choked with emotion. That was its impact.
Yes, it retained the core emotion of the play. P Madhavan [director] did a beautiful job in converting it into a movie format. Padmini gave a fantastic performance in the movie. Later, when I staged the drama, my co-artiste Nithya did a brilliant job. But the fact remains that nobody could match G Shakuntala [who played the wife’s character in the play].
The drama had a long-lasting impact on me because I was witnessing Sivaji perform for a live audience. He would be the first to arrive whenever there was a play. While doing the make-up, someone has to read out the dialogues for him, even if it were to be staged for the 50th time. He was adamant that way. Once the make-up gets done, he will no longer be Sivaji Ganesan but Padmanabhan. And when the play ends, he will become Sivaji again. In that sense, it was easy for him to switch on and off, which we [audience] could not do. To witness Sivaji Ganesan transform into the character is an experience that cannot be put in words.
No. I have worked with him in over 33 movies. We used to discuss a lot about movies and about his process as an actor. But I never told him about this idea. In fact, it came as a spark over a decade back. That I should remake the play as a tribute. Unlike other Sivaji Ganesan’s characters, this was something I could at least attempt. I spoke to Ramkumar [Sivaji’s elder son] about it and what he said was encouraging.
When I expressed the idea of remaking the play, everyone was against it, including my wife. Even I was clouded with doubts. But it was Madhu Balaji who gave me confidence and motivated me. It was kind of a co-artiste from another troupe to say that. That was the deciding point for me.
One is to make sure that it does not come across as a copy. And two, I was not trying to prove a point. People knew that I was a disciple of Sivaji Ganesan and wanted to honour his memory. In fact, I did a movie and play adaptation of Vietnam Veedu, and used the song ‘Un Kannil Neer Vadinthal’ as part of the play. The biggest compliment came from TM Soundararajan who said he really liked the way the song was used.

I have staged it over 70-80 times and the reception has always been heartening. The greatest lesson Sivaji taught me was to never imitate anyone. He used to say, ‘I have been inspired by Charles Laughton, Spencer Tracy and Marlon Brando, but never imitated them’. That I followed. Which is why people saw both Sivaji and a bit of YGM in the play.
Vietnam Veedu is nothing if you compare Nagesh’s other works. He is the definition of humour in India. If Sivaji is God, then Nagesh is Dronacharya for me. I once interviewed him for a channel and asked him about my comedy. His instant reaction was: ‘What do you want me to say, da?’ He later said that there are two kinds of comedians right now. One who has good ‘timing’ and one whose ‘time’ is good (laughs). I belonged to the first category is what he said.
Of course. Even today, you face a tinge of helplessness when you retire from work. In those days, retirement meant that your family was finished. We are facing the wrath of retirement in these 21 days (laughs). It was one of the first movies to tap into that emotion, which is why it is still relevant today.
It was adapted from my play Kannan Vandhaan. But you are right. The title was taken from Vietnam Veedu. In fact, there is a line that comes in the interval point where Sivaji says, ‘My uncle’s son Prestige Padmanabhan used to say that one must stand on his own legs. But let me tell you, one should not just stand on his legs but should stay as well.’",movies
"‘Chandramukhi 2’ confirmed, Raghava Lawrence plays the lead",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chandramukhi-2-confirmed-raghava-lawrence-plays-the-lead/article31300215.ece,"Raghava Lawrence took Twitter by surprise on Thursday with an announcement on his upcoming film, revealing that he will headline the cast of a sequel to Chandramukhi, the blockbuster hit starring Rajinikanth that released 15 years ago.
Tentatively titled Chandramukhi 2, the film marks the return of P Vasu in the director’s seat in Tamil films after his last release Shivalinga (2017), which, coincidentally, starred Raghava Lawrence. The choreographer-director-actor made a name for himself acting in a number of horror-comedies, notably carrying the Kanchana series of films.
Sun Pictures’ Kalanithi Maran, who backed the last two commercially successful films in the Kanchana franchise, and who Raghava Lawrence describes as his “lucky producer”, has come on board to produce Chandramukhi 2, the actor’s post on Twitter said.
Chandramukhi was produced by Sivaji Productions, and resulted in a massive change of fortunes for both the production house and Rajinikanth. Raghava Lawrence’s post suggests that the sequel is set to go on the floors with the approval of his screen idol and mentor, Rajinikanth. “I’m so lucky to act in this project with Thalaivar’s (Rajini) permission and blessings,” he says.

“50 lakhs for the PM-CARES fund, 50 lakhs to CM relief fund (Tamil Nadu), 50 lakhs for FEFSI union and I want to extend my special contribution of 50 lakhs for my dancer’s union,” Raghava Lawrence says, adding that he would spend ₹25 lakhs for the welfare of physically challenged children and another ₹75 lakhs for daily wage earners and residents of his birthplace in Desiya Nagar, Royapuram in north Chennai. “All food essentials will be delivered with the help of police with proper safety,” he adds in his statement.",movies

A.R. Rahman openly criticises ‘Masakali 2.0’, asks fans to enjoy original instead

That T-Series managed to successfully provoke Rahman, generally regarded as someone who keeps a cool head, with Masakali 2.0 is not entirely an unexpected turn of events; it was a question of when, not if. A simmering issue in Bollywood over the last decade, music labels have turned to sanctioning remixes of hit songs from the years past — much to the original composer’s disappointment — only for the end product to sound like something a wannabe DJ cooked up. Does this suggest a creative drain in Bollywood’s film music? YouTube connoisseurs, who have been reliving the golden era of film music far too often during the 21-day lockdown, seem to suggest in the affirmative.

That said, before Bollywood even suggestively glances at another AR Rahman track with the faintest hint of remixing it, be warned. As the maestro so eloquently put it on his Twitter post, these tracks take “365 days of creative brainstorming” with the sole purpose of producing “music that can last generations”.
It means: these tracks are already perfect the way they are. No, we don’t want them remixed. Back off!
Bollywood has already remixed three of Rahman’s iconic ‘90s tracks: the Urvasi song from Kaadhalan, ‘Andha Arabi Kadal’ became ‘The Humma song’ in Ok Jaanu, and Street Dancer 3D had Muqabala (also from Kaadhalan).
The immortal friendship anthem ‘Mustafa Mustafa’ is where we draw the line. College-themed subjects have dried up across film industries; perhaps, college life isn’t as romantic as the ‘90s made it out to be anymore. But when has reason ever defied logic when it comes to the decision-makers in Bollywood? With lyrics by Vaali, Rahman’s evergreen beats take you all back on a trip down the memory lane. Feels like creativity, doesn’t it?
More than Rahman, this song has Gulzar’s stamp all over it. This line: “Dil hai toh phir dard hoga, dard hai toh phir dil bhi hoga, mausam guzarte rehte hain”, which talks about the cycle of love, is an example. The purists may find issues with how Rahman sings, but for a generation of Rahmaniacs, there is noone better in the high notes. Sounds like originality, doesn’t it?
A song of longing. There is an air of authenticity about these Rahman songs, isn’t there? Maybe, this should be the social distancing anthem for the Tinder love birds already experiencing date night withdrawal due to the lock down. At the risk of sounding like a YouTube commenter caught in the web of emotions this lock down has caused, we want to say: “They don’t write songs like these anymore!” There also was the ‘Kadhal Rojave’ in Roja (1992), which was equally adept at eliciting the emotion of separation and distance out of the listener.
Roobaroo (penned by Prasoon Joshi, and whose creative too took a hit with Masakali 2.0) belongs to the ‘Mustafa Mustafa’ ilk but is, at the same time, a polar opposite in terms of the emotions that it conveys. An example of unison that cuts across class, caste and religious borders; a timely reminder of the truest threat to Indian unity, and an exemplary song to conclude the journey that was Rang De Basanti. “Aandhiyon Se Jaghad Rahi Hai Lau Meri, Ab Mashaalon Si Bhad Rahi Hai Lau Meri” — listening to such words in these dark times, accentuated by Rahman’s upbeat tune, is just what the doctor prescribed.
‘Roobaroo’ is one of those few songs that will stand the test of time on its own. No remix needed. Knowing Bollywood’s penchant for remixing tracks featuring foot-tapping beats, stay off ‘Rang De Basanti’ by Daler Mehndi too. Up to T-Series now to not get Diljit Dosanjh in trouble!
Is there any feeling truer than peace? Blissful peace is what ‘Khwaja Mere Khwaja’ offers its listener. This was a song that Rahman had composed for himself to listen to. It took an Ashutosh Gowariker to coax the maestro to let go off one of his gems for us lesser mortals to consume and be enthralled with. When Rahman goes “Khwajaji....” with the harmonium playing in the backdrop (at a time when no musician in Bollywood thought the harmonium had what it takes to appeal to a mass audience), it is our hearts that melt. Using a qawwali, at a time when the industry preferred to use electronic sounds even in period films, was a master stroke. If remixes are about reinvention, then no remix ever comes close to this reinvention.
Remember this was the year 1993, a long time before CDs and electronic music hit us. Remember this was the year 1993, just one year after AR Rahman had debuted in films. Also remember, this was the time when the music composer was probably criticised for being ‘too Western and hip.’ With this Mano-Sujatha-headlined track, sprinkled with some zingy flute interludes, Rahman proved to to the world that he could do folk too, with the same passion and vigour that he pursued other genres.
This romantic song has everything that would defy AR Rahman’s usual song logic - that you have to listen to it many times before you like it. The title track of ‘Raanjhanaa’ would probably have you falling for it immediately. There’s a catchy loop line, a consistent beat that never caeses to rest and apt vocals (by Jaswinder Singh) that headlines this track. The big bonus in the video is Dhanush’s oh-so-natural expressions in the rustic Varanasi landscape: do check out the part from 2:10 in which he dances in the middle of the road. If you are so insistent on listening to a ‘remix version’ of sorts for this one, there’s the impressive one that the Sunshine Orchestra and KM Music Conservatory put together.
 




 
Because of its simple, straight notes that caught on to us even before we realised it. Because no one else can infuse the throaty ‘oh’ between ‘Thanimai-oh’ and ‘Kodumai-oh’ as well as ‘singer’ Rahman did. Because the sound he used in this, back in 2006, will sound fresh on your headphones even today. And yes, because, no other song back then probably encapsulated loneliness as well as ‘New York Nagaram’ did.
It has been more than fifteen years since this came about, but check it out today, and chances are that you’d imagine yourself dancing in a crowded pub, full of people. The beats are very basic, 2000s-style ones, but the strong chorus and the repeat whisper-like renditions of ‘Fanaa’ and later ‘Sa Pa Ma Pa’ will make this song give any modern-day fast song a run for its ‘Mani’.
If ‘Masakali’ has been remixed, ‘Matargasthi’ (Tamasha), probably an inhabitant of the same musical world, might not be far behind, we fear. The voice of Mohit Chauhan, a favourite of AR Rahman in Bollywood, stands out in this peppy dance track featuring cute Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone showing off some ultra-cute dance moves.

The series is a lot more than a stand-up comic performance. Don’t get restless and give up on the comedy performance written and performed by Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby in the first 15 to 20 minutes; it gets better and better. I loved the gender conversations and debates. Nanette has the capacity to open up people’s minds to newer perspectives — of how others might view us or a situation. It helps us understand the lives of those who don’t lead a privileged life.







It’s a dark and edgy series and may not be everyone’s cup of tea. We have had an overkill of superhero movies and this was the antidote I needed. This could be a spoiler but since it comes in the first episode, I shall go ahead and say it. The story is set in a futuristic world where the superheroes are marketed, branded and corrupt. The series makes for a great masala watch.







 I still find some people telling me that they haven’t watched Breaking Bad. To me, this is the best television series ever and this lockdown is a good time to catch up on it if you haven’t, till now. It’s a subliminal show and I haven’t come across better writing. There are great characters that are so well written and executed. I would recommend watching it from start to finish.







This Malayalam film is fantastic and a great one to recommend for those who haven’t been watching films in languages other than their own. I loved the music, the acting and it was fantastic to see a star like Fahadh Faasil produce a film that has an ensemble cast and where he himself has comparatively less screen time. I loved the performances and am happy that all the actors who were part of it have gone on to do more films and deliver hits in their own right.







Okja by director Bong Joon Ho is not really among my top 25 all-time favourite movies, but I would strongly recommend it. Though I wouldn’t usually compare two films by a director, this film of Bong Joon Ho spoke to me better than his Parasite. I wasn’t much of an animal lover until Chinmayi brought home a puppy and everything changed. For those who don’t get what all the fuss is about with pets, do watch Okja. It’s a quirky, top-notch film that’s also truly global [in its appeal].

COVID-19 effect: Telugu cinema mulls over ‘new normal’ in the post-pandemic phase ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/covid-19-effect-telugu-cinema-mulls-over-new-normal-in-the-post-pandemic-phase/article31298706.ece,"Summers usually usher in a cheery mood in cinema halls across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Had things been normal, the celebratory mood would have kicked in for Telugu cinema on March 25, Ugadi, with the opening of director Indraganti Mohanakrishna’s action-thriller V, starring Nani, Sudheer Babu, Aditi Rao Hydari and Nivetha Thomas. But the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown has thrown the release dates of all new movies out of gear and has cast a question mark over the films in progress, as shootings have come to a standstill. A few filmmakers are contemplating direct OTT releases, while others are willing to wait and watch.
Writers, directors and a few composers have been connecting through video calls to collaborate on scripts and compositions and make the best use of lockdown time. There are also discussions to decide the next course of action — for filmmakers, distributors and exhibitors. 
It’s an evolving scenario and a clear picture will emerge only when India tides over the ongoing health crisis. Till then, there are only questions: What will happen to films that are awaiting release? Will theatres reopen after two or three months? Even if sanitisation protocols are followed, will the audience return to watch movies in a crowded hall? What should be the guidelines for health and hygiene at studios and film shootings when people return to work? 
Until now, Telugu films would stream on digital platforms only 50 days after the theatrical release. The 50-day norm, according to industry circles, might be tweaked to help small and medium budget productions that are considering direct release on OTT platforms. The others who’ve invested heavily and want their films to be savoured as theatrical experience will wait and watch, provided they can withstand the financial limbo for a few months.
Director Srividya Basawa whose debut film Madha released in theatres in mid March, barely two days before cinema halls across Telangana were shut, says niche films like hers would hugely benefit by releasing directly on OTT platforms. “I struggled for a year to get my film released and at one point, approached both Amazon Prime and Netflix. It wasn’t feasible then,” she says. 
Madha fetched good reviews and she’s been happy with the feedback after her film began streaming on Amazon Prime on April 8. “I’ve been seeing social media comments; people are watching films like Madha, HIT, and Palasa 1978 in Telugu, Trance, Ayyappanum Koshiyum and Driving Licence in Malayalam, and appreciating them. I think this lockdown period will open up people’s minds to new content. There will be more scope for us to explore unconventional films,” she says. Srividya has been using the time to write a web series and her second feature film.
Her thoughts are echoed by director Tharun Bhascker who agrees that it’s likely that new, brave content emerges in Telugu cinema. He also foresees writers and directors exploring themes of family bonds, humanity and survival. “This is a time to introspect and look at all the things we took for granted in life,” he says.
Tharun looks at two possible scenarios in the post Covid-19 phase — people getting too comfortable with viewing content at home, or realising the importance of social interaction and stepping out with a vengeance. Tharun feels the lockdown might also help create a bank of good scripts for Telugu cinema.
Content aside, the business is set to go through a churn. The Telugu and Tamil audience have so far been patronising the culture of watching films in theatres, not only when a spectacle film like Baahubali comes along. However, producers and distributors have been closely gauging the change in viewing habits in the last one year, as OTT platforms grew from strength to strength. 
Producer Madhura Sreedhar is looking at a direct OTT release for his next production titled Love, Life and Pakodi and says, “That feels like the best option, for me, where a small production is concerned; I needn’t worry about theatrical revenue and other logistics.” 
Once theatres re-open, we might be passing through temperature scanners, witnessing increased hygiene standards at cafeterias, and maybe even distanced seating, until a COVID-19 vaccine is in place.
Supriya Yarlagadda of Annapurna Studios explains how this ‘new normal’ will be enforced at Annapurna Studios. Two weeks before the nationwide lockdown, following the news of COVID-19 outbreak in Europe and the USA, she had installed wash stalls with soaps at the entrance of the studio, and put up boards about personal distancing. “People thought I was overreacting,” she says. 
When shootings of films and television serials resume in the studio premises, enhanced safety measures will be put in place. “We cannot go back to the old method of functioning until there’s a vaccine and everyone is inoculated,” she asserts.
The disruption due to COVID-19, says Supriya, has affected all aspects of the entertainment sector. She’s of the opinion that the film industry cannot thrive solely on OTT releases and those projects that promise a grand theatrical experience are likely to hold on till things get better.






Nani and Sudheer Babu in the action-thriller ‘V’
 






Director Indraganti Mohanakrishna agrees and says his team of V is going to wait and watch. “A comprehensive understanding of the scenario is only possible after a month or two. Public health is of utmost importance, everything else can wait. This is no time to promote our film. Ideally I would want people to watch my film in theatres, not only because of the budget involved, but also for the aesthetics. For instance, we have sound design by Bishwadeep Chatterjee and such good music by Thaman and Amit Trivedi, all of which will add to the theatrical experience,” he says. 
He acknowledges that OTT platforms have helped new voices emerge, but feels it might signal the beginning of the end of theatre culture if more films were to look at direct releases on these platforms. He points out that films don’t get undivided attention while viewed at home: “It could also get boring to watch film after film on your television or laptop.” 
In the film circles, ‘pay per view’ method of release is also being discussed, on the lines of what Kamal Haasan proposed for Vishwaroopam. If that model is to be followed, efforts will also go into plugging loopholes in film piracy.",movies
New streaming platform launched catering to Malayalam audience,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/new-streaming-platform-launched-catering-to-malayalam-audience/article31298661.ece,"Neestream, a new streaming platform that caters to the Malayalam-speaking population across the globe, has launched its premium services which is only currently available in the US and Canada for now.
While the premium service includes hundreds of Malayalam movies and a number of news channels, the basic service, containing original Neestream programs, is available worldwide for free, the American Bazaar reported on Wednesday.
“Per capita, Malayalees consume more news and entertainment content than most linguistic groups in the developing world,” said Javad K. Hassan, Chairman of the JKH Holding Co., a Virginia-based global conglomerate of companies operating in a number of technology and service areas.
“Our objective with Neestream is to give Malayalis in India and around the world the best of Malayalam entertainment and current affairs,” he said.
While the US streaming giants have an advantage in resources, Hassan said Neestream intends to compete with them. 
“As an operation focused solely on the Malayalam market, we hope we will be able to make an impact by bringing the finest and most informative content to the consumers.”
The aim of coming up with a dedicated platform in Malayalam, according to Hassan, was to bridge an important and much needed gap when it comes to meaningful content for Malayalam-speaking households around the world, the American Bazaar reported.
Asif Ismail, CEO of Neestream, said the streaming platform will focus on unearthing talent and creators in Kerala and from within the global Malayalee diaspora.
For subscribers in the US, the platform also offers some English content in a category called Neestream Americas.",movies

Iranian film Castle of Dreams directed by Reza Mirkarimi I saw this film at IFFK 2019 in Trivandrum. It explores fatherhood and its responsibilities, in a delicate manner leaving you emotional.
Palestinian film It Must Be Heaven directed by Elia Suleiman It pays tribute to the Masters of the silent film era like Chaplin and Buster Keaton. It is philosophical, political… done with great humour 
Portuguese film Vitalina Varela by Pedro Costa It is about death, colonialism, female hardship and faith. It leaves the interpretation to the viewer. Viewers who enjoy the films of Andrei Tarkovsky and Federico Fellini will savour the experience 
French films: Les Miserables directed by Ladj Ly and Synonyms by Nadav Lapid Les Miserable is a political satire and has a documentary-like mise en images, Synonyms is also talked about for its political views and an electrifying performance by Tom Mercier. A basic understanding of French political history would add value to the viewing experience. Most of these films are new experiments in narrative, and follow non-linear screenplay and touch upon political subtexts in a subtle way.

Michael Madana Kaama Rajan, directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao It is a technically brilliant film supported by Kamal Hassan’s fine acting. Besides the top-notch camera and editing finesse, not once do you feel it is the same Kamal Hassan playing four roles! 
Vikram directed by Rajasekhar This movie is timeless. I love how the great action takes the story forward. The song ‘Vikram, Vikram….’ has an electronic voice interlude and has amazing choreography which is a real treat to watch.
Inaindha kaigal directed by NK Vishwanathan for its action-driven story. The film also proved that action needn’t always be about brawls and car chases. 
Ullathai Allitha directed by Sundar C Actor Goundamani steals the show. It is a trendsetter. Dialogues from this movie, especially Goundamani Sir’s lines bring on the laughs even today. It’s a masterpiece performance from him.

His three-minute film Maatharam addressed women’s issues and featured Jyoti Kisange Amge, the world’s shortest living woman. Ajith plans to develop Maatharam as a full-length feature film. “Right now I am focussing on scripting the movie. I want my first feature film to be a hard-hitting one. And, I thought issues faced by women needs urgent attention, especially in the current times when you hear of rape and domestic violence.”

Ajith picks 
The Shawshank Redemption directed by Frank Darabont The prison drama particularly for its story and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. One of the greatest films made in the 1990s, it is broadcast even now regularly as it is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant
Godfather (part 1) by Francis Ford Coppola Is there any filmmaker who hasn’t been inspired by the Godfather franchise? I keep going back to it, as one of the greatest and influential films in the gangster genre, just to watch the performances of the ensemble cast of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Every time, there is something new to takeaway from the movie. 
Pulp fiction by Quentin Tarantino It is a masterpiece from one of the greatest film makers. The unconventional structure, the screenplay, the pop culture....every single element in this film leaves you awestruck
Forrest Gump directed by Robert Zemeckis Besides Tom Hank’s performance, the film stands out for its extensive visual effects. There is comedy, sadness... magic. A must see for anyone who loves cinema.
The White Balloon (Iranian) directed by Jafar Panahi Iranian dramas always leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling. This charming Iranian children’s drama is a reminder to focus on the simplest pleasures of life that are often the most satisfying.

"Atul Kulkarni and Neil Bhoopalam on their latest series, 'The Raikar Case'",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/atul-kulkarni-and-neil-bhoopalam-on-their-latest-series-the-raikar-case/article31297148.ece,"Over the years, many show creators in the West like Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly) have talked about bingeing and how it takes away from the viewing experience. Closer home, actor Neil Bhoopalam echoes the thought. “I feel you miss the nuances of a show, especially if it is a drama. My favourite TV watching memories are of waiting a week for the next episode of Doogie Howser MD and The Wonder Years. I cannot binge-watch anything; it is an overload for my brain. I’d much rather take the time to mull over an episode before moving on to the next,” says the actor, whose latest outing, The Raikar Case, might be the perfect series to slow-watch.
Released on April 9, the show is set in Goa. It revolves around a joint family that, on the surface, seems to be perfect, but dark secrets unravel after the youngest member takes his own life — and blames his family for forcing him to take the drastic step. Helmed by Aditya Sarpotdar, the show stars Atul Kulkarni, Ashwini Bhave, Parul Gulati and Kunal Karan Kapoor along with Bhoopalam. While Kulkarni plays the family patriarch, Bhoopalam is the cop investigating the case. “My character is the only outsider in the whole story,” says the actor, who will next be seen in season two of Four More Shots Please.
When Bhoopalam got a call from Bodhi Tree Productions about the show, he was immediately hooked. “I was reading Jack Reacher books at the time, so when I got a call about a whodunit that is also a family drama, I was interested.” Among his recent favourites in the genre is last year’s Agatha Christie-esque Knives Out by Rian Johnson, with Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson.

His co-star Kulkarni’s taste in murder mysteries veers towards classics like Hitchcock films and Sidney Sheldon’s books. “This is a genre that I gravitate towards as a viewer. I love Hitchcock’s films because even though you knew who did it right at the beginning, he still kept the audience engaged till the last frame. Among books, one of my early favourites was Gurunath Naik, a Marathi novelist. His mysteries were very popular in the 70s.”
A significant portion of the show was shot in Goa. A long outdoor schedule in the sunny State gave most of the cast — who had not worked with each other before — a chance to bond. “When we were not shooting, we were either talking about what we had eaten or what we were going to eat! Everyone was on the hunt for the best food. Aditya knew of these little restaurants that few knew about,” says Kulkarni.
Shooting on palm-lined lanes and eating in restaurants are a thing of the past with the country in the third week of lockdown. At home with wife Nandini Shrikent, a casting director, and two-and-a-half-year-old son Fateh, Bhoopalam is spending quality time with his family and catching up on shows like The Modern Family, The Twilight Zone (2019) and the classic, Star Trek Voyager.
His co-star, meanwhile, is spending the time at his country home in Sonale, a village couple of hours from Mumbai. “This is where my NGO, Quality Education Support Trust (QUEST) operates from. We have over 3,000 teachers who work with around 95,000 children across Maharashtra. As their classes have come to a halt now, teachers are conducting daily video meetings,” says Kulkarni. The Rang De Basanti actor is also working on his farm, spending time in his gym, and playing with his pets.

And then there’s Nadja: the seductress, the temptress, the vampiric Bonnie to Laszlo’s Clyde. Also cohabiting in the vampire household is Guillermo, Nandor’s familiar; and Colin Robinson, an energy vampire and day-walker of sorts: he feasts on humans, but not on their blood.

"'Houston, we’ve had a problem here': Apollo 13’s most famous quote originated in Hollywood ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/apollo-13s-most-famous-quotes-originated-in-hollywood/article31296131.ece,"Apollo 13's best known quotes originated not in space or Mission Control, but in Hollywood.
Their moon-bound spacecraft wrecked by an oxygen tank explosion on April 13, 1970, the astronauts urgently radioed, “Houston, we’ve had a problem here.”
Screenwriters for the 1995 film ‘Apollo 13’ wanted to punch that up. Thus was born, “Houston, we have a problem.”
Even more artistic license was taken with NASA flight director Gene Kranz’ mobilizing speech to his team in Houston.
Kranz never declared, “Failure is not an option.”
Ask Kranz what he actually told flight controllers, and he rattles it off without a moment’s hesitation a half-century later.
“I have never lost an American in space, sure as hell aren’t going to lose one now. This crew is coming home. You got to believe it. Your team must believe it. And we must make it happen.”
Kranz said the moviemakers came up with “Failure is not an option.”
Does he wish he’d said it? “No - I’m satisfied with what I said.”
Kranz constantly finds himself setting the record straight - “in fact, every time I speak.”
“I try not to plagiarize,” he said with a laugh.
Director Ron Howard’s film starring Ed Harris as Kranz and Tom Hanks as mission commander Jim Lovell was based on Lovell’s 1994 autobiography, “Lost Moon.” Actors Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon portrayed Apollo 13 astronauts Fred Haise and Jack Swigert.",movies

The special will feature fellow cast members Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox.

The remix has opened to mixed reviews, and Rahman clearly isn’t impressed with his songs being re-created, as he took to Twitter sharing the link of the original number, along with a note that read, “No short cuts, properly commissioned, sleepless nights, writes and re-writes. Over 200 musicians, 365 days of creative brainstorming with the aim to produce music that can last generations. A team of a Director, a Composer and a Lyricist supported by actors, dance directors and a relentless film crew. Lots of love and prayers, A.R. Rahman.”

Delhi-6 director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra took the criticism a notch higher, saying that the remix would ""damage eardrums"" on Twitter. “#Masakali #Delhi6 created with love and passion an iconic song that has to be preserved. Beware of the remix it will damage your eardrums,” he posted.
Lyricist Prasoon Joshi, who heads the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), also wrote of his disappointment: “All songs written for #Delhi6 including #Masakali close to heart, sad to see when original creation of @arrahman @prasoonjoshi_ &singer @_MohitChauhan insensitively utilised. Up to the conscience of @Tseries. Hopefully the fans will stand for originality. @RakeyshOmMehra.""
Rahman’s earlier popular tracks such as Humma Humma, Urvashi, Muqabla are among others that have been remixed. While the composer hasn’t explicitly stated earlier that he’s against the newer adaptations, he has never endorsed them either.
Masakali 2.0 has over 14 million views and is in the top 5 trending videos on YouTube India currently since its release on Wednesday.

Inflation may drop to 2.4% in FY21: RBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/inflation-may-drop-to-24-in-fy21-rbi/article31302536.ece,"The consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation, which had stayed elevated in the last few months, is expected to soften during the course of the financial year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its monetary policy report (MPR).
 “CPI inflation is tentatively projected to ease from 4.8% in Q1 of 2020-21 to 4.4% in Q2, 2.7% in Q3 and 2.4% in Q4, with the caveat that in the prevailing high uncertainty, aggregate demand may weaken further than currently anticipated and ease core inflation further, while supply bottlenecks could exacerbate pressures more than expected,” the RBI said. The central bank said, looking ahead, the balance of inflation risks is slanted even further towards the downside. 
The MPR was released on Thursday. The report follows the unscheduled monetary policy meeting held in end March to discuss the uncertainties arising from the nationwide lockdown. Since the review was conducted in end March, the early policy review, scheduled for April, was withdrawn.
“Given the lockdown, the compilation of the CPI for March and the following few months by the National Statistical Office could also become challenging. For 2021-22, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation could move in a range of 3.6-3.8%,” the RBI said. The RBI had reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps) to 4.4% in the monetary policy review while cash reserve ratio was reduced by 100 bps to 3%. The cental bank, however, refrained from making any prediction on growth. “Under highly fluid circumstances in which incoming data produce shifts in the outlook for growth on a daily basis, forecasts for real GDP growth in India are not provided here, awaiting a clear fix on the intensity, spread and duration of COVID-19,” the RBI said while observing the economy was looking up before the virus broke out.
 “The sharp reduction in international crude oil prices, if sustained, could improve the country’s terms of trade, but the gain from this channel is not expected to offset the drag from the shutdown and loss of external demand,” the report said.
The RBI said relatively modest upsides are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID-19, if that occurs. However, it added, such uncertainties make the forecasting of inflation and growth highly challenging. 
On exchange rates, the central bank said renewed bouts of global financial market volatility caused by the uncertainty of macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19, as in February-March 2020, could exert pressure on the Indian rupee. 
“Should the rupee depreciate by 5% from the baseline, inflation could edge up by around 20 bps while GDP growth could be higher by about 15 bps through increased net exports,” it said.
In contrast, should COVID-19 normalise quickly, strong capital flows could revive. An appreciation of the rupee by 5% could moderate inflation by around 20 bps and GDP growth by around 15 bps vis-a-vis the baseline,” the RBI said. ",economy

She warned that “global growth will turn sharply negative in 2020,” with 170 of the International Monetary Fund's 180 members experiencing a decline in per capita income.
“In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,” Ms. Georgieva said in a speech previewing next week's spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, which will be held virtually due to the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19.
Even in the best case the IMF expects only a ""partial recovery"" next year, assuming the virus fades later this year, allowing normal business to resume as the lockdowns imposed to contain its spread are lifted.

But “it could get worse,” and “there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook” and the duration of the pandemic.
Countries already have taken steps worth a combined $8 trillion, but Ms. Georgieva urged governments to do more to provide “lifelines” for businesses and households to “avoid a scarring of the economy that would make the recovery so much more difficult.”
On Tuesday the IMF will release its World Economic Outlook with grim forecasts for its members for this year and next. In January, the IMF projected global growth of 3.3 percent this year and 3.4 percent in 2021. But that was a different world.
“The bleak outlook applies to advanced and developing economies alike. This crisis knows no boundaries. Everybody hurts,” Ms. Georgieva said.
She noted that about $100 billion in investments already had fled emerging markets — more than three times the capital exodus seen in the 2008 global financial crisis. ",economy

 Petrol and diesel demand is down 66% in April, while aviation turbine fuel (ATF) consumption has collapsed by 90% as most airlines have stopped flying, industry officials said.
 India had consumed 2.4 million tonnes of petrol and 7.3 million tonnes of diesel in April 2019. As much as 6,45,000 tonnes of ATF was used in that month last year.
 The collapse of demand in the world’s third-biggest consumer during April comes on the back of worst fuel sales in more than a decade recorded in March 2020.
 The country’s petroleum product consumption fell 17.79% to 16.08 million tonnes in March as diesel, petrol and ATF demand fell, according to official data released here.
 Diesel, the most consumed fuel in the country, saw demand contract by 24.23% to 5.65 million tonnes. This is the biggest fall in diesel consumption the country has recorded as most trucks went off-road and railways stopped plying trains.
 Petrol sales dropped 16.37% to 2.15 million tonnes in March as the 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced to prevent the spread of COVID-19 took most cars and two-wheelers off the road.
 With flights grounded since mid-March, ATF consumption fell 32.4% to 4,84,000 tonnes.
 The only fuel that showed growth was LPG as households rushed to book refills for stocking during the three-week lockdown period.
 LPG sales rose 1.9% to 2.3 million tonnes in March.
 This is the first estimate of total petroleum product consumption in the country. This includes sales by both public and private sector companies.
 Previously, provisional numbers of the three public sector oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) — were released that also showed a 17% drop in petrol and 26% slump in diesel sales in March.
 Industry officials said the pattern in fuel consumption is continuing in April as the lockdown is to last till mid of the month and there are indications that part restrictions will continue even after the lockdown is lifted.
 Petrol and diesel sales in April are one-third of what they were a year ago, they said adding that demand is expected to pick up when the lockdown is lifted and restrictions on public transport lifted.
 LPG sales in April is up 30%, they said adding that these are provisional trends and actual numbers will only be known at the month-end.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a 21-day lockdown beginning March 25, shutting offices and factories, barring those involved in essential services. Also, flights were suspended, trains stopped plying, vehicles went off the road and cargo movement stopped as most people were asked to stay home to help check the spread of coronavirus.
 March is the first month in two-and-a-half years when petrol sales have seen a negative or de-growth.
 Naphtha consumption in March was up 15.7% to 1.38 million tonnes, possibly because of its increased use in power plants. But, other industrial fuels such as fuel oil posted a 10.4% drop to 4,82,000 tonnes.
 Bitumen, used in road construction, saw a 41% drop in consumption to 5,25,000 tonnes.
 In the full 2019-20 fiscal (April 2019 to March 2020), petroleum product consumption was almost unchanged at 213.68 million tonnes as compared to 213.21 million tonnes of fuel consumed in the previous 2018-19.
 LPG consumption saw a 5.8% rise to 26.3 million tonnes, while petrol sales were up 5.9% to 29.97 million tonnes.
 ATF sales slipped 3.6% to 8 million tonnes and diesel consumption was down 1.1% at 82.6 million tonnes.
 Diesel sales had shown modest growth in April 2019 to February 2020.",economy

Equities stage smart rally on fiscal stimulus hopes,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/equities-stage-smart-rally-on-fiscal-stimulus-hopes/article31302592.ece," Equity benchmarks gained strong ground on Thursday with the Nifty closing above the psychological 9,000-mark for the first time since March 16. The gains were primarily due expectations that the government might soon announce a stimulus package. A positive trend in Asian economies on hopes that the COVID-19 pandemic might be peaking acted as a strong catalyst. 
The 30-share Sensex gained 1,265.66 points, or 4.23% to close at 31,159.62. Stocks like M&M, Maruti Suzuki India, Titan, Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank all gained over 7% each on Thursday.

The broader Nifty moved up 363.15 points or 4.15% to close at 9,111.90. The India VIX index dropped a little over 5% on Thursday. Earlier in the day, global financial major Bank of America Securities said that it expects the government to announce a second set of financial stimulus package to address the growth slowdown and fiscal deficit concerns. “We expect the MoF (Ministry of Finance) to announce a second fiscal stimulus of 0.3% of GDP atop 35 basis points done. The choice is between a fiscal stimulus to support recovery and a higher fiscal deficit on falling growth,” stated the report. 
“The fiscal package could focus on subvention for MSIs (micro and small industries) and real estate and recapitalizing PSU banks as slowdown raises NPLs (non performing loans),” it added. Meanwhile, Asian markets rose on hopes that the coronavirus pandemic might be peaking as data showed that the daily incremental rise in the number of cases slowed in some countries.

Equity MF inflow most in 2 years,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/equity-mf-inflow-most-in-2-years/article31302570.ece,"Equity mutual fund (MF) schemes saw the highest-ever monthly inflows in two years as investors looked to invest at a time when most shares are available at highly beaten-down valuations even as the month saw overall industry outflows at the highest quantum since September 2018.
In March, the net inflow into equity schemes was pegged at ₹11,722.74 crore, as per data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). This was the highest monthly inflow since February 2018 when such schemes registered inflows of ₹14,683 crore. 
Further, there was a rise in the number of SIP (systematic investment plans) folios as well in March.
The overall mobilisation via SIPs in 2019-20 was pegged at a little more than ₹1 lakh crore, higher than the previous fiscal’s ₹92,693 crore. This assumes significance as the benchmark Sensex lost a little over 23% in March — the highest monthly drop in more than 11 years.
“Instead of exiting their investment in equity funds, retail investors have not only held on, but added more assets and folios through SIPs,” said N. S. Venkatesh, chief executive, AMFI. 
Debt schemes, however, saw massive outflows of almost ₹1.95 lakh crore, which was in line with most quarter-end trends on account of redemption pressures to meet advance tax payment requirements.
“Periodic advance tax payments are a reason for a rise in outflows in March every year, this year though, there are a few supplementary factors that have piled on,” said Tarun Birani, founder and chief executive officer, TBNG Capital Advisors, an investment advisory and wealth management firm.
“Equity inflow figures are a positive indication that investors continue to put faith in the long term in equities despite negative markets,” added Mr. Birani.
Meanwhile, the huge redemption pressure in debt funds led to an overall outflow of ₹2.13 lakh crore from the industry assets, the highest monthly outflow since September 2018 when the IL&FS crisis hit the market.
 The total assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry was pegged at ₹24.71 lakh crore in March..
